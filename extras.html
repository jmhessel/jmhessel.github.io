  You found my secret page! I'm not big on advice, but, I do have a few tidbits that have been helpful for me, at least.
  <blockquote>
    "We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely." 
    <cite>--- Oscar Wilde</cite>

    The best writing advice I have received<sup>1</sup> is: "Don't write down anything you don't believe: it's bad for your brain." This seems obvious: so, why is it helpful? I tend to "buy" that clear writing is clear thinking, and so, returning to this mantra helps sentences, arguments, and thoughts to become more precise on the page. Side effects of this advice include: fewer adverbs, shorter abstracts, punchier intros, and, overall, improved clarity regarding the specific claims/arguments that one is making.

    <sup>1</sup> This advice derives from an undergrad computer science professor of mine. I haven't checked with them on whether the precise wording of this advice should be attributed to them, so, I will keep them anonymous. But, if you end up finding this useful and are curious about the original source, do let me know! I received this advice in reference to writing mathematical proofs, but, I have found it a helpful mantra more broadly.
