This is suggesting that the man doesn't have any physical health issues but he is possessed by a demon. You exorcise, or remove, a demon with an exorcism and that sounds similar to exercise.</td></tr></table><hr><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">Preliminary GPT-3 Explanation</p><p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px">conditioned on description+uncanny+caption.</p><table><tr><th>GPT3 explains: "No, I recommended exorcism, not exercise."</th><td>It's funny because the doctor is holding a flaming piece of paper in his hand. The man is asking the doctor what his diagnosis is. The doctor is holding the paper in his hand and is not looking at it. So the man thinks the doctor is being sarcastic. The man suggests exercise, not exorcism.</td></tr></table>
