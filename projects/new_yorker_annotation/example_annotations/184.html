Instead of standing up and guarding the throne with the other guard, he is choosing to do what he wants while the king is away. It's funny because he is using the excuse of the king not acting like a king, instead maybe the king is acting like a child so he will too.</td></tr></table><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>kind-of confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>A man is sitting in a hammock inside a castle. A guard near the throne looks at him.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>Hammocks didn't exist back then</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>False</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: man in hammock, to: guard</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>It's funny since the guard is just messing around. He won't start acting like a guard until the king becomes more mature. Thus, he's using his hammock. I'm guessing that is why it's funny.</td></tr></table>
