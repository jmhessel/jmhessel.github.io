A man is setting at his desk looking towards another man who is dressed more formally than him.  The better dressed man is holding a dummy that is showing the man at his desk a piece of paper.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>The nicely dressed man is holding a dummy, which is usually not seen in the workplace.

People report things like inappropriate touching to HR.  Since the dummy has the man's hand up him, he is making a joke about how he'd like to report it to HR, even though that's how a dummy works.  The term inappropriate touching can be used in both serious manners and joking manners in this case.</td></tr></table>
