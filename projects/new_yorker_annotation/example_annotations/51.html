One woman is holding a wine glass and talking to the a couple who are tied up and standing in buckets.  The couple are dressed for the party, but they are disheveled with hair out of place and clothing wrinkled.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>The couple who are tied up and standing in buckets are out of place.  They look as if they have been kidnapped which would be unusual in a cocktail party.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>False</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: the woman with dark hair and glasses holding a wine glass, to: the couple standing in buckets</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>Timeshare presentations are where you go to listen to an advertising pitch to become an owner of a timeshare vacation rental.  People do this because you can get a reduced price or even free vacation rental, but you just have to give up some of your time during your vacation to listen to the long-winded conversation.  This caption is funny because it depicts a timeshare salesperson who is so pushy, she has actually tied up the couple so they will listen to her pitch.</td></tr></table><hr><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">Preliminary GPT-3 Explanation</p><p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px">conditioned on description+uncanny+caption.</p><table><tr><th>GPT3 explains: "Our timeshare presentation will begin in about 5 minutes."</th><td>It's funny since the couple in the bucket are not dressed for the party. They are not even dressed for a presentation. They are likely being held against their will. If they were going to a timeshare presentation they would be dressed for it.</td></tr></table>
