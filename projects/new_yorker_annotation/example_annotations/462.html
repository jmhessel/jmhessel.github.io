The meaning is that because a cigar is phallus shaped that when someone is smoking a cigar is likes having a penis in their mouth. But this saying means that not everything has to signify something other than what it is. Because this is a car and not a man they are referring to a dipstick rather than a cigar.</td></tr></table><hr><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">Preliminary GPT-3 Explanation</p><p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px">conditioned on description+uncanny+caption.</p><table><tr><th>GPT3 explains: "Sometimes a dipstick is just a dipstick."</th><td>The therapist is talking to the car because he is a dipstick.
