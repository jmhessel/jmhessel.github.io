The meaning is that because a cigar is phallus shaped that when someone is smoking a cigar is likes having a penis in their mouth. But this saying means that not everything has to signify something other than what it is. Because this is a car and not a man they are referring to a dipstick rather than a cigar.</td></tr></table>
