The baby's parents are standing at the open door of his room.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>The microphone is out-of-place as this is a baby who probably cannot speak well, and there is no crowd for him to speak to.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>False</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: baby, to: parents</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>The baby is standing in front of a microphone as if he is a comedian in a nightclub which is funny because it is so ludicrous. The caption is a play on the commonly heard phrase, "I'll be here all night." Comedians say this at the end of a routine in a nightclub, whereas the baby is telling his parents they will not be sleeping that night as he will be awake all night.</td></tr></table>
