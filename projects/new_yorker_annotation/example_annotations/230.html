The man is wearing a headset and is dressed in business attire, and he is running on a large hamster wheel.  The room appears to be an office as it looks like there is a name plate on the door.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>The hamster wheel and pine shavings are out-of-place. You would not expect to see a desk, chairs, and cabinets in an office, not hamster items.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>pun location</th><td>28	38	fast track</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: man, to: wife on phone</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>A person said to be on the "fast track" in business means they are being promoted at a faster than normal rate.  On the other hand, the man is on a hamster wheel which could also be called a "fast track".  This is funny because of the play on words as well as the ridiculousness of seeing a business man running on a hamster wheel in his office.</td></tr></table>
