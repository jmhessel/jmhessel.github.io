In this case the mice are trying to assemble or navigate something inside the box which they are currently outside of. It's a play on words for something everyone has heard of before but now looking at the mice's problem in a different way.</td></tr></table><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>Two mice are looking at directions to building a maze.

In this case, though, "thinking inside the box" refers to the maze box. The mice are trying to figure out how to build it. It's funny since they have to think "inside" the box instead of "outside" in this case since they need to go into the maze to do it.</td></tr></table>
