This is funny because Lance Armstrong is a famous cyclist. The woman thinks he looks like him, but the knight says he looks like "Lance" a lot, referring to Lancelot the knight, not Lance Armstrong.</td></tr></table><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>Two cyclists are biking down the street in a city. While one cyclist is wearing tradtional cycling gear and clothing, the other is wearing medieval armor.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>The cyclist on the right is wearing medieval armor which is very unusual for anyone on a bicycle.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>pun location</th><td>44	55	Lance a lot</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: the cyclist in the armor, to: the cyclist on the left</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>"Lance a lot" is a play on words. Lancelot was a character in an old fairytale about King Arthur. "Lance" is also the name of a famous cyclist "Lance Armstrong". In this case mistaken for "Lance a lot" means mistaken for Lance Armstrong many times.</td></tr></table>
