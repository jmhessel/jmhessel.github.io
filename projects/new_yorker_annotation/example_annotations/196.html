On the other hand, there is also a lifesaver which is thrown to a person who is in the water to help them stay afloat.  This is funny because the men are stranded, surrounded by water, and they could probably use a floatation device, or lifesaver.  On the other hand, the man is talking about the candy and saying he can't see it on the island filled with candy.  The play on words is funny.</td></tr></table><hr><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">Preliminary GPT-3 Explanation</p><p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px">conditioned on description+uncanny+caption.</p><table><tr><th>GPT3 explains: "I do not see a lifesaver."</th><td>The joke is that there is no life saver in sight.
