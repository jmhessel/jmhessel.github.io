In this saying, the pen represents diplomacy and the sword represents war.  This caption is funny because the one man is starts by saying that "the pen is mightier" which is fitting because pens are expected to be found in a corporate office and used for business contracts, but the twist is that there's randomly a sword sticking out of this desk, and the man speaking is acknowledging the importance of the pen in a business setting, but he clearly thinks that the random sword looks really cool.</td></tr></table><hr><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">Preliminary GPT-3 Explanation</p><p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px">conditioned on description+uncanny+caption.</p><table><tr><th>GPT3 explains: "The pen is mightier, but that looks awesome."</th><td>The sword is stuck in the table.
