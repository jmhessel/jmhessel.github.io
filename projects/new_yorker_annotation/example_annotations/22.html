The contrast between the fun party and the couple's predicament is already  funny in a dark way, and the statement is funny because this woman is just mingling with the couple like she would any other party-goer. She is recommending the East River as a nice place for them to be thrown into and drowned which is funny because it is definitely contrary to what a kidnapped couple would want to hear in a similar situation.</td></tr></table><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>kind-of confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>A woman at a party is talking to two people.
