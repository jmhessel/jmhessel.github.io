There are multiple people going about their day walking both around and over him. An annoyed looking businessman is walking over him, as are a woman and a younger man. There's a woman in a hat walking a dog and the dog is looking back at the man lying on the ground. An older woman is carrying groceries around the guy while a larger man in a t-shirt is standing and staring at the man.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>The man in a suit lying on the walkway.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>False</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: man lying on the pavement, to: himself</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>He's making a joke out of how he landed on the pavement. He looks like he's having a relaxing nap and in what he said he's explaining how he should have jumped from a higher floor because if he had, he would have died on impact. It's kind of dark humor since it deals with death.</td></tr></table>
