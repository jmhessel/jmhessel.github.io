One of the two men is holding up his fishing rod with a chandelier dangling from it.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>While it is somewhat common for people fishing to inadvertently catch debris and trash, it is highly unusual to catch something link a fine chandelier that is in good condition.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>False</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: the fisherman with the chandelier, to: the fisherman to the left</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>When a fisher or hunter catches an exceptionally large animal or fish, there is a tendency for them to have it fixed and mounted so that it can be hung up on the wall as a trophy and decoration in the residence of the person who caught the animal/fish.  However, this sort of d√©cor is not particularly attractive and is only really appreciated by people who are into fishing or hunting.  This fisher's statement is implying that his wife doesn't approve of the idea of him mounting fish that he's caught on the walls of their house, but in this scenario, since he's somehow managed to catch a chandelier, his wife would actually let him hang it in the living room of their house because it actually looks elegant.  The joke here is that it is highly unlikely that a fisherman would ever catch a chandelier that is in reasonably good shape out in an open body of water, but it is something his wife would actually like.</td></tr></table><hr><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">Preliminary GPT-3 Explanation</p><p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px">conditioned on description+uncanny+caption.</p><table><tr><th>GPT3 explains: "I've finally caught something my wife will let me hang in the living room."</th><td>It's funny since the chandelier is a fish, but it is not a fish that either of the men wanted to catch.</td></tr></table>
