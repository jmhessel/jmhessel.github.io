He is wearing business attire that is inappropriate for a horse ride on a ranch, but is something he might wear on an airplane trip. Often people say I'll call you when I'm on the ground when they are in a plane that is getting ready to land, meaning when the plane is on the ground. It's funny here because he is literally about to be on the ground after flying off of the horse.</td></tr></table><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>A man on a cellphone is being kicked off a horse he was riding.

But in this case, he's being thrown from a horse and is going to land on the ground. Thus it's funny since it's like he's about to get back from a trip and is calling his wife about it.</td></tr></table>
