There is a man and woman standing at the front of the classroom in laboratory jackets with clipboards.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>The ducks are out of place. In a classroom with laptops, you would expect human students, but these are ducks who do not even have a way to type on the laptops or operate a mouse.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>False</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: the duck on the second row all the way to the right, to: the duck beside him</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>This caption assumes that the ducks are taking a test on the computer.  One duck has asked the other duck to help him answer a question on the test, but the other duck can't get the laptop to turn on.  This is funny because ducks have wings and would not be able to turn on or type on the laptop.</td></tr></table>
