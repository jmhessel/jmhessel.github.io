There is a man and woman standing at the front of the classroom in laboratory jackets with clipboards.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>The ducks are out of place. In a classroom with laptops, you would expect human students, but these are ducks who do not even have a way to type on the laptops or operate a mouse.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>False</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: the duck on the second row all the way to the right, to: the duck beside him</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>When a poultry farmer kills a duck or chicken, he wrings their necks as a fast death.  The duck is probably frustrated at his inability to interact with the laptop, so he wants to wring his own neck to get out of this frustrating situation.  It is dark humor, but it is funny in that a duck does not really want to wring his own neck.  The duck is using an exaggeration to make the point that he is frustrated.</td></tr></table>
