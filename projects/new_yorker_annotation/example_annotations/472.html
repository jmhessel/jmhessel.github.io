The duck is probably frustrated at his inability to interact with the laptop, so he wants to wring his own neck to get out of this frustrating situation.  It is dark humor, but it is funny in that a duck does not really want to wring his own neck.  The duck is using an exaggeration to make the point that he is frustrated.</td></tr></table><p><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>kind-of confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>A bunch of ducks are behind computers in a lab or classroom.
