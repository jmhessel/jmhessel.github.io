In a modern era, corporations and companies compete with each other, and sometimes one tries to takeover the other, but with business tactics, and not actual battle.  When one company takes over another, without the support of company leader but with the support of the shareholders, it is called a hostile takeover.  The joke here is that the sword in this corporate business office is a sign that there was a hostile takeover, but it actually involved real, physical fighting using weapons and such.</td></tr></table><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>kind-of confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>Two employees standing in an office staring at the desk.
