It's also funny because the worker asks the Grim Reaper why he is asking.</td></tr></table><hr><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">Preliminary GPT-3 Explanation</p><p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px">conditioned on description+uncanny+caption.</p><table><tr><th>GPT3 explains: "Yes, we all had the potato salad.
