Since the construction worker admits to the Grim Reaper that they all had the potato salad it is understood that they will all die from eating the potato salad. It's also funny because it would be assumed that someone would die from falling from the beam, not potato salad. It's also funny because the worker asks the Grim Reaper why he is asking.</td></tr></table><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>Men in overalls are sitting on a railing overlooking a city.
