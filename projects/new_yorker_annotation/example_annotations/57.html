A man is standing beside him holding costumes. The wolf is trying on a sheep costume.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>The wolf is out-of-place as we would expect to see a person trying on costumes, not a wolf.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>False</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: man, to: wolf</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>Wall street is an aggressive, competitive environment.  The wolf is also an aggressive animal that competes in the wild for food resources.  The man here is saying that a trader on Wall Street is aggressive like a wolf which is funny because the caption makes fun of Wall Street traders.  There is also a movie called The Wolf of Wall Street and this could also be a play on that title.</td></tr></table>
