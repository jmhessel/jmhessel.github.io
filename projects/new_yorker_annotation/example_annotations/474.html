Donald Trump and his brand of hotels and casinos have always maintained the superficial appearance of being fancy, so you'd expect to see something like a chandelier at one of these properties, but also the Trump corporation has a long history of bankruptcies.  Therefore, the caption is joking that this Trump hotel is so deeply in trouble financially, that it's not metaphorically underwater, but that it is physically underwater, which is why this fisher was able to fish-up a chadelier.</td></tr></table><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>Two men are fishing.

But underwater also refers to something that failed or went bankrupt (like Trump's hotels). So it's funny since he's comparing them.</td></tr></table>
