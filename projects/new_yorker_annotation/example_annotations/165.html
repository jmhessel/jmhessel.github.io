Additionally, though, middle-aged can refer to the actual age range of someone, who is in their 40s. So, the joke is, she either doesn't date men who are that age, or, she doesn't date men from the specific period of history.</td></tr></table><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>A knight is having dinner with a woman.
