Police question suspects when people are missing. They sometimes show them a picture and ask if they've seen the person. The officer is showing something, that could be a picture, to the shark. Sharks are often accused of attacking trying to eat humans. So they shark is saying it doesn't remember if he's seen the person, because they would have been it's meal days ago. It's funny because to the officer it's a a missing person, but the shark is defending itself by claiming it was a meal.</td></tr></table>
