The man is wearing a headset and is dressed in business attire, and he is running on a large hamster wheel.  The room appears to be an office as it looks like there is a name plate on the door.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>The hamster wheel and pine shavings are out-of-place. You would not expect to see a desk, chairs, and cabinets in an office, not hamster items.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>pun location</th><td>20	23	run</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: man, to: person on phone</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>The man is running on a huge hamster wheel, but people will also say they have to "run" when they need to leave to perform an errand.  This is funny because of the play on words and also because of the ridiculousness of a man running in a hamster wheel.</td></tr></table>
