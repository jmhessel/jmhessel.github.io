The man is a shepherd, and they use staffs (sticks) to herd sheep. But staff can also mean employees or personnel, thus he's talking about a job which can mean either.</td></tr></table><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>There is a shepard sitting on a couch holding a staff with his legs propped up on a coffee table in a living room. He is on a cell phone. He is also surrounded by sheep.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>Sheep would never be in a living room, nor a shepard which is unusual.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>pun location</th><td>21	30	staff job</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: the shepard, to: the other person on the phone</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>A "staff job" refers to being part of a "staff" or group of workers all working together. It also has a double meaning pertaining to the staff he is holding, a staff used by shepards. "A leadership position" also has a double meaning. On one hand a leadership could mean leading people in a group of workers, and on the other hand it could mean leading the sheep to graze or to a water source.</td></tr></table>
