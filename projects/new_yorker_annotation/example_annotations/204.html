It also has a double meaning pertaining to the staff he is holding, a staff used by shepards. "A leadership position" also has a double meaning. On one hand a leadership could mean leading people in a group of workers, and on the other hand it could mean leading the sheep to graze or to a water source.</td></tr></table><hr><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">Preliminary GPT-3 Explanation</p><p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px">conditioned on description+uncanny+caption.</p><table><tr><th>GPT3 explains: "Just tell Dad it's a staff job with a leadership position."</th><td>The shepard is talking about a new job. But he is not being specific about what it is. It will be a job with a lot of responsibility, and he will need to lead a group of people. It will be a staff job. The joke is funny because the word staff has two meanings. It means the stick that the shepard is holding. It also means the group of people who work at a company.</td></tr></table>
