Cleaning a fish is a rather unsavory task, but a necessary one.  This caption is funny because the man is stating that his wife told him that he would have to clean whatever he caught, implying that she wanted no part of cleaning fish.  However, even though he unexpectedly caught a fancy chandelier, which is notoriously difficult to clean and dust because of how delicate and intricate it is, his wife's rule that he has to clean whatever he catches and brings home still applies.</td></tr></table>
