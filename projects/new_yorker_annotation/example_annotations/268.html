The lower torso of a man is standing on the back of one of the sharks, with his upper torso above the surface of the water.

In this case, the sharks want to wait, assuming that the man is trying to get more people into the water for them to eat.  Also, the man is confused about the depth of the water, because he think's he's standing on the floor when in fact he is standing on a shark.</td></tr></table><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>Two sharks are in the ocean. One has a person standing on top of it, and has it's mouth open as though the sharks are having a conversation.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>There is a person standing on a shark in the water.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>False</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: Shark on the right, to: Shark on the left</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>The person probably wouldn't knowingly stand on a shark, so they must think they're standing on the ocean floor. Sharks are believed to eat humans, so this would make a great snack for the sharks. The caption is funny because the sharks know the water is deep, and want to be patient in order to have more people in the water. Once the human's friends are in the water with him, the sharks will have plenty to eat.</td></tr></table>
