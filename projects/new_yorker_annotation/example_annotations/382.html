The suspects in the police line-up are what is known as a matryoshka doll. When you open the largest doll you'll find a smaller one and inside each one is another smaller doll. The cop is saying he got the doll to "open up" meaning to confess or literally open, and now the doll is beside herself. Beside herself can mean a person is angry but in this case it means literally beside herself.</td></tr></table><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>A man and woman are in an office. There are Matryoshka dolls on the shelf and the two people are shaped like them. The woman is angry at the man.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>Matryoshka dolls are in the lineup at a police station.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>pun location</th><td>13	20	open up</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: man, to: woman</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>It's funny because the people in the lineup are clearly Matroshyka dolls, which can be opened up and grouped together. Opening up means literally opening up in this case, but can also mean revealing emotions or information. Beside yourself is funny here too since Matryoshka dolls can be alone or stacked.</td></tr></table>
