The suspects in the police line-up are what is known as a matryoshka doll. When you open the largest doll you'll find a smaller one and inside each one is another smaller doll. The cop is saying he got the doll to "open up" meaning to confess or literally open, and now the doll is beside herself. Beside herself can mean a person is angry but in this case it means literally beside herself.</td></tr></table><hr><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">Preliminary GPT-3 Explanation</p><p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px">conditioned on description+uncanny+caption.</p><table><tr><th>GPT3 explains: "I got her to open up, but now she's beside herself."</th><td>It's funny because both the woman and the dolls are angry. The police station lineup is funny because there is only one empty space. Also the dolls are figurines of a Russian nesting doll. The woman is in the last doll which is also the smallest.</td></tr></table>
