As a result, old money families/individuals are often seen as having more refined tastes and more traditional signs of wealth, such as large, lavish homes, as compared to wealthy individuals who've come to have their wealth only more recently, as a result of stocks or cryptocurrency.  In this comic, the caveman in the ditch is look at the caveman in the large cave and his remark is implying that the caveman in the large cave came from "old money".
