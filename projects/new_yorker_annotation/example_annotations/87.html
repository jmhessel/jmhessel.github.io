Also, we eat bananas, while a psychiatrist will ask a patient "what's eating you" in an attempt to see what is bothering a patient.  The word play here is funny.</td></tr></table><p><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>A banana peel is on a couch.

That can also mean revealing your emotions. Bananas can be eaten, but "eating you" can also refer to something bothering you. This is a therapy session so it's funny.</td></tr></table><hr><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">Preliminary GPT-3 Explanation</p><p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px">conditioned on description+uncanny+caption.</p><table><tr><th>GPT3 explains: "Now that you've opened up, let's talk about what's eating you."</th><td>It's funny because the psychiatrist is sitting on a banana peel and she is asking about the patient's problems. This is a play on words because the word "eat" has a double meaning of "eat" as in food and "eat" as in talk to.</td></tr></table>
