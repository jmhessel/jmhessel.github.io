That can also mean revealing your emotions. Bananas can be eaten, but "eating you" can also refer to something bothering you. This is a therapy session so it's funny.</td></tr></table><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>The scene is of a psychiatrist's office with the couch for the patient and the doctor in a chair.

Also, we eat bananas, while a psychiatrist will ask a patient "what's eating you" in an attempt to see what is bothering a patient.  The word play here is funny.</td></tr></table>
