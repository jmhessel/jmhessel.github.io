This is something you would read either on the packaging or in the instructions. In this case the cheese is not included in order to complete the mice's mouse maze which is the real purpose of the maze so the whole project is pointless.</td></tr></table><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>Two mice are looking at directions to building a maze. The maze pieces are on the floor unassembled.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>Mice are not smart enough to put together mazes.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>False</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: mouse, to: other mouse</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>It's funny since mice eat cheese. When you buy a game or something to assemble, certain things are not included (like batteries). So cheese was not included in this case. So it's funny since mice love cheese.</td></tr></table>
