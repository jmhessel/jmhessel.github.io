They sometimes show a suspect a picture and ask if they've seen the person. The officer is showing something, that could be a picture, to the shark. Sharks are often accused of attacking trying to eat humans. So they shark is saying it doesn't remember if he's seen the person, because it would be just one of many that it's eaten. Human suspects will often say they don't remember things in the same type of way.</td></tr></table><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>Two detectives are interrogating a shark in a room.
