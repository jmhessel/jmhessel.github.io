One woman is holding a wine glass and talking to the a couple who are tied up and standing in buckets.  The couple are dressed for the party, but they are disheveled with hair out of place and clothing wrinkled.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>The couple who are tied up and standing in buckets are out of place.  They look as if they have been kidnapped which would be unusual in a cocktail party.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>False</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: the woman with dark hair and glasses holding a wine glass, to: the couple standing in buckets</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>The couple have been kidnapped and are in a cocktail party which is already funny because it is not what we expect, but the fact that this woman is correcting a statement like a schoolteacher just makes this scene even more surreal and funny.  The saying that you will "sleep with the fishes" is something you would hear in an old mobster movie where the mob puts people in buckets of concrete then throws them in the river.</td></tr></table>
