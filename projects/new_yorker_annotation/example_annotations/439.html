There are about seven people in rolling chairs that have all piled up on the right side of the picture. There is a man sitting at a table which must be bolted down as it has not moved, and he is the only one who did not roll out of place because the table is holding him.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>The room is leaning to the right.

The double meaning here and what makes this so funny is that the meeting is literally getting away as the people have all slid to the right side of the room because it is leaning.</td></tr></table><p><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>A room is tilted. A man is at a table on one side of the room. A bunch of people in chairs are toward the bottom looking at the man at the desk.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>The entire room is tilted to one side.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>pun location</th><td>16	36	getting away from me</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: man, to: group</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>It's funny since the room is tilted. The group is in the corner, away from the boss. So it's funny because they are literally away from him. "Getting away from something" can also mean something being out of control. In this case it's literal though.</td></tr></table><hr><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">Preliminary GPT-3 Explanation</p><p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px">conditioned on description+uncanny+caption.</p><table><tr><th>GPT3 explains: "This meeting is getting away from me."</th><td>It's funny since the room is tilted.
