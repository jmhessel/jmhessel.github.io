The group is in the corner, away from the boss. So it's funny because they are literally away from him. "Getting away from something" can also mean something being out of control. In this case it's literal though.</td></tr></table><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>There is a meeting in a very crooked room that is leaning to the right.  There are about seven people in rolling chairs that have all piled up on the right side of the picture. There is a man sitting at a table which must be bolted down as it has not moved, and he is the only one who did not roll out of place because the table is holding him.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>The room is leaning to the right. People are all piled up together against the wall instead of being seated around the table as they would during a normal meeting.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>pun location</th><td>5	36	meeting is getting away from me</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: the man at the head of the table, to: the group of people on the right side of the picture</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>When a person says a meeting is getting away from them, they mean that other people are talking or interrupting the meeting and they cannot keep order.  The double meaning here and what makes this so funny is that the meeting is literally getting away as the people have all slid to the right side of the room because it is leaning.</td></tr></table>
