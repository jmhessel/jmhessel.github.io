Firstly, dogs don't usually wear clothes.  They don't work in offices, and they do not know how to use computers.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>False</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: woman, to: man</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>Dogs are capable of recognizing certain oft-repeated phrases and will get excited if they associate positive stimuli with them.  Dogs love food, and walks, so owners will often spell out the words when communicating with each other rather than just saying the words.  They do this because dogs cannot spell, and therefore cannot get excited.  The two people are speaking in such a way so the dogs won't understand they're asking eachother out to lunch.</td></tr></table>
