A man is setting at his desk looking towards another man who is dressed more formally than him.  The better dressed man is holding a dummy that is showing the man at his desk a piece of paper.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>The nicely dressed man is holding a dummy, which is usually not seen in the workplace.

There is some sort of pressure there to perform well.  Since a dummy is usually used by putting a hand up the rear area to make it look like it talks, you can also say that the dummy had corporate up their ass since the man using the dummy is dressed nicer.  The man is probably a higher up in the company.</td></tr></table>
