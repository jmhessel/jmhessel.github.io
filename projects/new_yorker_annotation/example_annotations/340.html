"Singing in the Rain" is a classic movie from 1952 starring Gene Kelly. The joke here is that the guard swinging in the hammock is enjoying himself and now singing to himself the classic song. It's funny because of the double meaning of "Reign" and "Rain".</td></tr></table><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>A man is sitting in a hammock inside a castle.

It rhymes with the lyrics "singing in the rain" and "reign" in this case means the period where a king or queen rules. Thus it's funny.</td></tr></table>
