Normally it's hard to put together and pretty cheap. So these mice are comparing this maze assembly to that. It's probably hard to do or very cheap, so they are mad about it.</td></tr></table><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>Two mice are talking near the entrance of a rectangular box. They are both holding on to a piece of paper with instructions on it. In the middle of the box are stacked flat pieces of wood, a handle and some screws.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>Mice can't talk and they definitely can't understand any written instructions.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>False</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: the mouse on the right, to: the mouse on the left</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>Ikea is a well known furniture brand. They make furniture parts which you buy and then take home and put together yourself on your own. The cartoon here is a good example of what an Ikea product looks like when you take it out of the box at home with pieces of wood and screws. The mice are frustrated with having to construct their own mouse maze because they have to figure out how to do it.</td></tr></table>
