In a classroom with laptops, you would expect human students, but these are ducks who do not even have a way to type on the laptops or operate a mouse.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>pun location</th><td>40	51	wisequacks!</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: the woman in the lab jacket, to: the ducks</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>The ducks are taking a test, or perhaps working for the people, and the woman is telling them to get back to work.  The humor is that the woman uses the word "wisequacks" which is a play on the word "wisecracks".  When a person makes a sarcastic statement, it can be called a "wisecrack".  Because these are ducks and they quack, they would "wisequack" if they were being sarcastic about the work they were being asked to do.</td></tr></table><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>A bunch of ducks are behind computers in a lab or classroom.

Ducks quack. "Wise cracks" means goofing off and is funny since ducks quack and they replaced cracks with quacks.</td></tr></table>
