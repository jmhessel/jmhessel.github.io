There are about seven people in rolling chairs that have all piled up on the right side of the picture. There is a man sitting at a table which must be bolted down as it has not moved, and he is the only one who did not roll out of place because the table is holding him.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>The room is leaning to the right. People are all piled up together against the wall instead of being seated around the table as they would during a normal meeting.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>False</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: the man at the head of the table, to: the group of people on the right side of the picture</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>The man is holding a meeting in this crooked room to fire the architect because the room was designed wrong.  The joke is that the room is so badly warped, the architect had to be really bad, and the company who moved in had to be blind not to see how bad the work was.</td></tr></table>
