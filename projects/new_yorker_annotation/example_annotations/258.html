There are multiple people going about their day walking both around and over him. An annoyed looking businessman is walking over him, as are a woman and a younger man.

An older woman is carrying groceries around the guy while a larger man in a t-shirt is standing and staring at the man.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>The man in a suit lying on the walkway.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>pun location</th><td>22	29	walk-on</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: man lying on the pavement, to: everyone else on the sidewalk</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>The term "walk on" is used as a pun because these people walking on the sidewalk are literally walking over him as he lies there.
