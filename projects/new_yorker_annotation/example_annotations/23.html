How do we remove the paintings?</p><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>A caveman and cavewoman are hiding in a hole in the ground while they look at the entrance of a nearby cave.  There is a bearded caveman sitting at the entrance of the cave, almost as if he's guarding the entrance.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>The unusual element of this image is that the caveman and cavewoman appear to be in the hole in the ground to surveille or spy on this cave.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>False</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: the caveman, to: the cavewoman</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>Since the caveman and the cavewoman are standing in a ditch, or hole, it looks as if they are trying to be covert and are trying to stay hidden from sight.  Therefore, it appears that they are spying on the caveman sitting at the entrance of the cave.  The position of the caveman in the cave makes it seems like he's guarding it, which is similar to a security guard being posted at the entrance of an art museum that houses priceless art.  Therefore, this caption is making the joke that this is some sort of prehistoric art gallery and this caveman is guarding the entrance, while the caveman and cavewoman in the hole are prehistoric art thieves, who are plotting their heist.</td></tr></table><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>A caveman is alone in a cave. Two cavemen are peaking out of a hole in the ground looking at hime.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>Cavemen don't live in holes. They live in caves.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>False</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: man in hole, to: woman</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>It is funny since they are equating the cave to an art museum. Cavemen made paintings on cave walls. You cannot remove them. So it's funny since people will steal paintings, but you can't steal ones drawn on a wall.</td></tr></table>
