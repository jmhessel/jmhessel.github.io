Therefore, it appears that they are spying on the caveman sitting at the entrance of the cave.  The position of the caveman in the cave makes it seems like he's guarding it, which is similar to a security guard being posted at the entrance of an art museum that houses priceless art.  Therefore, this caption is making the joke that this is some sort of prehistoric art gallery and this caveman is guarding the entrance, while the caveman and cavewoman in the hole are prehistoric art thieves, who are plotting their heist.</td></tr></table><hr><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">Preliminary GPT-3 Explanation</p><p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px">conditioned on description+uncanny+caption.</p><table><tr><th>GPT3 explains: "Getting past the guard is easy.
