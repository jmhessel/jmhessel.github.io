"Dressing to kill" means dressing nicely and well enough to impress others. This is literal, though, since he is a wolf and will kill sheep and cows for his clothes.</td></tr></table><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>The scene is of a wolf in a dressing room filled with different animal costumes.  A man is standing beside him holding costumes. The wolf is trying on a sheep costume.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>The wolf is out-of-place as we would expect to see a person trying on costumes, not a wolf.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>pun location</th><td>21	34	dress to kill</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: wolf, to: man</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>When a man dresses in fine clothing, he is said to be "dressed to kill".  The caption contrasts this with the wolf who is dressing in sheep clothing to get close to sheep so he can kill them.  This is funny because of the play on words that are the same with different meaning.  It is also funny because it is unexpected to see a wolf talking and acting like a human.</td></tr></table>
