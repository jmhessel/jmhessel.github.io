This other caveman invested in it. Investing would mean he isn't using it and is cold, I think. He is just putting his money into it. He's not using it.</td></tr></table><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>A caveman and cavewoman are hiding in a hole in the ground while they look at the entrance of a nearby cave.  There is a bearded caveman sitting at the entrance of the cave, almost as if he's guarding the entrance.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>The unusual element of this image is that the caveman and cavewoman appear to be in the hole in the ground to surveille or spy on this cave.</td></tr><tr><th>pun</th><td>False</td></tr><tr><th>quote</th><td>True</td></tr><tr><th>said by ___ to ___</th><td>by: the caveman, to: the cavewoman</td></tr><tr><th>caption explanation</th><td>The man in the hole is looking enviously at the man sitting in the cave and making a remark in a manner similar to a person jealously looking upon another living person living in a nice house or mansion.  In this caption, the man is imply that he invented fire, but he failed to reap the financial reward for his discovery, while the caveman in the cave made a fortune by investing in his invention.  This is somewhat similar to what happens with numerous technological inventions, which result in bountiful riches for those who invest in the technology, while the original inventor, the one who did all the hard work, doesn't reap nearly as large of a financial reward.</td></tr></table>
