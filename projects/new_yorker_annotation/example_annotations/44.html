The dragon in this picture is probably called Puff, and he's trying to reconcile with the princess but she doesn't feel anything for him anymore, hence the "magic" being gone. Combining all of this gives a little hint reference to Puff the Magic Dragon.</td></tr></table><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>kind-of confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>There is a woman at the door of a castle and a dragon outside with flowers. The woman seems surprised by the presence of the dragon.</td></tr><tr><th>image uncanny description</th><td>Flowers in dragon's hands is the unusual element in this picture.
