While a hostile takeover involves some amount of pressure, it is nothing like an actual battle in which hostilities take place.  The joke here is that the sword stuck in the desktop represents that a battle was fought in this office, and the hostile takeover actually involved fighting and weapons, as opposed to merely strongarm corporate business tactics.</td></tr></table><hr><table><tr><th>annotator confidence</th><td>kind-of confident</td></tr><tr><th>image description</th><td>Two employees standing in an office staring at the desk.
