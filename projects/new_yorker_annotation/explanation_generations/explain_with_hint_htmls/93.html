A jaguar is a type of car, but it's also a type of wild cat. In this case, the mouse is riding on the cat like it's a jaguar car, but since it's just a regular cat, the mouse has to explain that it's a rental.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The mouse is riding a cat, but "jaguar" can also refer to a type of car. Therefore, the mouse could be saying that the cat is a rental car that he's using because his own jaguar (i.e. the animal) is in the shop. This is a humorous contrast because usually, it's the other way around: people ride animals when their cars are in the shop.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. A jaguar is a type of car, but it is also a type of cat. The mouse is riding the cat like a horse, and the other mice comment that it is a rental, and that the jaguar (the car) is in the shop. This is funny because it is a clever way to use the different meanings of the word "jaguar" to create a joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The mouse is riding on the cat, but the cat is also a type of car, which is why the mouse says it's a rental. This is a clever way of saying that the mouse is using the cat as transportation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The mouse is riding on the cat, which is acting like a jaguar, but the mouse says it's a rental, meaning it's not really a jaguar, just a car. This is humorous because it's a literal interpretation of a idiom, which is usually not done.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the mouse is riding on the cat like it's a jaguar, a type of car. However, the mouse says it's a rental, indicating that he doesn't own the cat, and that the jaguar, another type of cat, is in the shop. The wordplay is humorous because it's unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words.

The mouse is riding a cat, but the word "jaguar" can also refer to a type of car. So, the joke is that the mouse is riding a cat because the jaguar (the car) is in the shop. This is a play on words because it's unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it takes the concept of a "rental car" and applies it to a cat, which is a type of animal. The fact that the mouse is riding the cat like it's a horse, and that the cat is wearing sunglasses, makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The mouse is riding on a cat, but the cat is also a type of car, a Jaguar. The mouse says that it's a rental because it's not his cat, and also because Jaguars are relatively fancy cars that one would usually only rent rather than own.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the mouse is riding a cat, but the other mice make a comment about how it's just a rental and not their own jaguar. This suggests that they either own a jaguar or they have access to one, which is funny because jaguars are a type of car, but they are also a type of cat. The joke is clever because it plays on the multiple meanings of the word "jaguar."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of the word "car." A car can be a vehicle that you drive, but it can also be a carriage that you ride in, like the one the mouse is riding. The joke is that the mouse is actually riding a cat, which is a type of animal, not a type of car.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The mouse is riding on the cat, which is acting as a jaguar (a type of car), but a jaguar is also a type of cat. So, the mouse is effectively riding a cat that is pretending to be a car.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="92.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="94.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
