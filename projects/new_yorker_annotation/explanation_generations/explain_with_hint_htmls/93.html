But, "spear" can also refer to the type of weapon, which makes the joke a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the situation is deadly serious --- a man has a spear through his chest --- the other person's line is funny because it highlights the absurdity of the situation. The fact that the man almost got hit with the spear himself, but narrowly avoided it, points to the randomness of the situation, and makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The caveman says that he "almost wore the same spear," meaning that he almost got hit by the spear in the same way as the person in the cave painting. However, "wore" can also mean "to carry or have on one's person," so the caveman could also be saying that he almost had the spear on his person, i.e., he almost got hit by the spear.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The caveman with the spear through his chest almost wore the same spear, meaning he almost got hit with the spear in the same way as the person in the painting. But, because he didn't get hit with the spear, he's still alive to tell the story. The joke is a pun on the phrase "I almost died", which is often used hyperbolically to describe a close call. In this case, the caveman did almost die, which makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the person who got hit by the spear almost avoided being in the painting entirely. This is a play on the fact that, in most cave paintings, the subjects are wearing hardly any clothes or jewelry, as that was not common in prehistoric times. Thus, the joke is that the person who almost got hit by the spear is lucky that he was wearing the same spear as the person who did get hit, or else he would have been completely naked in the painting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The first caveman says that he "almost wore the same spear," meaning that he almost got hit by the spear in the way that the other caveman did. This is a clever way of saying that he almost got killed by the spear.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the cavemen almost got hit by the spear too, but he is wearing a different outfit. This is a play on words, as the caveman is saying that he is almost "wore" the same spear, meaning that he was almost hit by it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The caveman with the spear through his chest is saying that another caveman almost got hit with the spear, but he (the caveman with the spear through his chest) stopped him. The joke is that, of course, the other caveman didn't almost get hit with the spear, the first caveman did, because he's the one who has the spear through his chest.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The spear that the caveman is wearing is the spear that hit him, and the other caveman almost wore the same spear. This is funny because it's a double meaning: the other caveman almost got hit by the spear (i.e., he was almost in the same situation), and also, the other caveman almost wore the spear (i.e., he almost had the spear go through his chest).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the painting, the spear is going through the caveman's chest, and in real life, there is a caveman with a spear through his chest. The other caveman says that he almost wore the same spear, meaning he almost got hit by the spear too, but he avoided it. This is a play on words, because the other caveman is literally wearing the same spear as the caveman who got hit.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman who is impaled by the spear is surprised that he is being depicted in the painting, as if this was an event that happened long ago. However, the other caveman notes that he almost wore the spear, meaning that it was a close call and the event being painted is actually quite recent.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The caveman with the spear through his chest says that the other caveman almost wore the same spear, meaning that he almost got hit with the spear too. This is a clever way of saying that the other caveman was almost in the same situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman with the spear through his chest could have easily been the other caveman in the painting. This nearly happened, according to the joke, but the caveman dodged at the last second. The joke is funny because it's a close call that is easily forgotten since the painting captures the event that did happen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The caveman with the spear through his chest almost wore the spear, meaning he almost got hit by it. But, he didn't wear the spear, meaning he wasn't hit by it. The other caveman almost got hit, but he didn't, so he's safe.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman with the spear in his chest is wearing the same spear as the one that hit him. This is absurd because it's highly unlikely that the spear that hit him would have been the same spear that he was wearing at the time. The joke is further funny because the other caveman implies that he almost got hit with the spear as well, but was saved by a change in outfit.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="92.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="94.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
