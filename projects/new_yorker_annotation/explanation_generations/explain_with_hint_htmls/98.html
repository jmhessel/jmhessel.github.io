However, the fighter jet is not a car, and the pilot's response to the request is a callback to the historic moon landing line, "one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind". The joke is made funnier by the contrast between the mundane traffic stop request and the momentous space exploration event.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police officer is about to ask the pilot to step out of his jet, but first, he tells the pilot to take "one small step" --- a reference to the iconic line spoken by Neil Armstrong when he became the first human to step on the moon. The joke is funny because it's a completely incongruous request given the situation, and it's made even funnier by the fact that the police officer is completely serious.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it references the famous line spoken by Neil Armstrong when he became the first human to set foot on the moon, "one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." The joke twists this line to be about a police officer asking a pilot to step out of his jet, a much less momentous task, but one which still requires the person to physically leave their vehicle.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it conflates two different situations: the famous moon landing, in which Neil Armstrong took "one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind," and a police officer asking someone to step out of their car during a traffic stop. The joke is clever because both situations involve someone taking a step out of a vehicle, but the moon landing is obviously much more significant than a routine traffic stop.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is making a pun on the famous phrase "one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind" uttered by Neil Armstrong when he became the first human to walk on the Moon. In this case, the cop is telling the rocket driver that he needs to take a small step out of his vehicle. The pun is humorous because it is a play on the small/large sizenorms of Earth and space, as well as a play on the expected function of a rocket (to go to space) versus its unexpected location (driving on the road).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The policeman is telling the driver to step out of the vehicle, which is a common request during a traffic stop, but he phrases it in a way that also references the famous quote from Neil Armstrong when he became the first man to walk on the moon, "one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it alludes to the famous line uttered by Neil Armstrong when he became the first person to walk on the moon: "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." In this case, the cop is telling the rocket driver to take a small step out of his vehicle, but the step is small relative to the giant leap that the rocket driver just took by driving his rocket on the road.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is asking the rocket driver to take one small step out of the vehicle, which is a reference to the famous line from the Apollo 11 Moon landing, "one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the cop is asking the driver to take a small step, but in order for the driver to do so, he would have to take a giant leap, which is impossible.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." This was the famously quoted line from Neil Armstrong when he first stepped on the moon. The cop in the joke is saying that, in order to give the rocket driver a ticket, he will need to step out of the rocket, just like Armstrong had to step out of the lunar lander.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is telling the rocket driver to get out of the space vehicle, using the famous phrase uttered by Neil Armstrong when he became the first person to walk on the moon. The joke is a play on words, as the cop is telling the driver to take a small step out of the space vehicle, just as Neil Armstrong took a small step onto the moon.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the policeman is telling the driver to step out of his vehicle, which is a common request during a traffic stop, but he phrases it in a way that references the most famous line from the moon landing: "one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." In this case, the small step is the driver getting out of his car, but it's also a play on the much more momentous small step of the first man on the moon.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is asking the rocket driver to step out of the vehicle in the same way that people are typically asked to step out of a car during a traffic stop. However, the fact that the driver is a rocket adds an element of absurdity, since it's not possible for the driver to step out of the vehicle in the same way as someone in a car. The joke is also a play on the famous line from the Moon landing, "one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." In this case, it's a small step for the rocket driver, but a giant leap for traffic safety.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because there is a double meaning of "one small step." The first is a reference to the famous line uttered by Neil Armstrong when he became the first human to walk on the moon. The second is a more mundane reference to what police officers say when they are removing someone from a car during a traffic stop. The juxtaposition of these two moments, one of humankind's greatest achievements and a more mundane one, is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it references both the moon landing (with the line "one small step") and police procedures (with the cop telling the driver to step out of the vehicle). These are two very different things, so the juxtaposition is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of the phrase "one small step." The cop is telling the rocket driver to step out of the vehicle, but the phrase "one small step" is most famously associated with the first moon landing, when Neil Armstrong stepped out of the lunar module onto the moon's surface. As such, the cop's use of the phrase is a play on words, implying that the rocket driver is not just steps out of the vehicle, but is taking a much larger step (literally and figuratively) by driving a rocket on the road.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="97.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="99.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
