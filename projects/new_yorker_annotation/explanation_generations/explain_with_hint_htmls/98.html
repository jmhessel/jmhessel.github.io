A "rodent scholar," by contrast, is someone who studies rats. This is silly because, while rats are intelligent creatures, they are not as advanced as humans, and thus, not as qualified to be doctors.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man confuses "rodent scholar" with "rhodes scholar." A rodent scholar is someone who studies rats, while a rhodes scholar is someone who attends Oxford University. The man probably thought the rat was a rhodes scholar, which is why he's so shocked.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the doctor's office is shocked to see a rat dressed as a doctor, and when he asks if the rat is a rhodes scholar, the rat misunderstood and thought he was asking if he was a rodent scholar. This is funny because it is a play on the fact that rats are often considered to be vermin, and thus, not scholars.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rat is trying to tell the patient that he is not a qualified doctor, despite what his title might suggest. "Rodent scholar" is a play on the phrase "Rhodes scholar," which is a prestigious academic honor. The joke is clever because it sounds like the rat is saying he is a qualified scholar, just not in the field of medicine.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. A "rhodes scholar" is a highly prestigious award given to students who study at Oxford University. A "rodent scholar" is someone who studies rodents, which is much less prestigious. The fact that the rat is dressed as a doctor makes the joke even funnier, because it implies that he is pretending to be something he's not.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is clearly mistaking the rat for a different type of scholar. A rhodes scholar is a prestigious award given to scholars, whereas a rodent scholar is someone who studies rats. The mismatch in expectations is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man thinks the rat is a doctor, but the rat is actually a scholar of rodents. This misunderstanding is funny because it's a play on words --- the rat is a "rodent scholar," rather than a "Rhodes scholar."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a rhodes scholar is a highly-educated person who has received a prestigious scholarship, while a rodent scholar is a person who studies rats. The joke is clever because it sounds like the rat is saying he is a rhodes scholar, but is actually saying he is a rodent scholar.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is apparently mistaking the rat for a Rhodes Scholar, which is a prestigious academic honor. However, the rat is actually a rodent scholar, which is not nearly as impressive. The joke is clever because it uses a play on words to create the punchline.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man mistakes the rat for a rhodes scholar, which is a highly prestigious academic honor. However, the rat is actually a rodent scholar, which is not nearly as impressive. This mistake is funny because it is a play on words; the two words sound similar but have different meanings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is mistaking the rat's occupation. The rat is a rodent scholar, which is a type of scholar who studies rodents, rather than a Rhodes Scholar, which is a highly prestigious award given to students. The man is surprised because he assumed the rat was much more qualified than he actually is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rat is trying to pass itself off as a scholar, but is misspelling the word "rodent." This is a play on words because "rodent" and "rhodes" are both words that start with the letter "r." The joke is also funny because it's implausible that a rat could be a scholar of any kind.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="97.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="99.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
