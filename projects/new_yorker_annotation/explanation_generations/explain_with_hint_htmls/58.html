It was made out of straw, fer chrissake!</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is talking about a werewolf, who is traditionally known for being the "big bad wolf" who blows down the houses of the three little pigs. In this scene, the werewolf is dressed as a businessman, which subverts the expectations of what a werewolf should look like. The man is also surprised at the damage estimate for the straw house, which is a callback to the original story.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it references the folktale of "The Three Little Pigs," in which a wolf huffs and puffs and blows down a house made of straw. However, in this case, the werewolf is the one who is surprised that the house is made of straw, because he presumably would know that a house made of straw is not sturdy enough to withstand his strength.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the concept of "pennywise and pound foolish": in other words, the speaker is surprised that the werewolf is being sued for 400 grand when it seems like the damage he caused (to a straw house) should be significantly less expensive. However, the joke is also funny because it's a reversal of the expected roles: usually, it's the werewolf who is the big bad wolf in children's stories, and the business-people who are the sheep (or, in this case, pigs).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The werewolf is angry about having to pay 400 grand in damages, but the other man points out that the house he destroyed wasn't made out of brick or stone, it was made out of straw. This is a reference to the story of the three little pigs, where the big bad wolf blows down the house made of straw.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it references the Three Little Pigs story, in which a big bad wolf blows down a house made of straw. The werewolf in the suit is analogous to the big bad wolf, and the people in business attire are equivalent to the three little pigs. The joke is clever because it also references the fact that werewolves are often associated with the moon (hence, "lunar"), and the Three Little Pigs story is also about the moon (the moon is said to be made of green cheese).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the classic fairy tale, "The Three Little Pigs." In the story, the wolf huffs and puffs and blows the house down, but when he does, the pigs sue him for damages. The joke is clever because, in this business-professional context, the werewolf is analogous to the wolf, and the person he is talking to is analogous to the pig. The Fer chrissake part is just adding emphasis to the fact that the house was made of straw and therefore not very strong.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the werewolf is making a reference to the Big Bad Wolf from the story of the Three Little Pigs. In the story, the wolf is able to blow down the house made of straw, but not the houses made of wood or brick. The werewolf is saying that the damage done to the straw house wasn't worth as much as the insurance company is claiming.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it alludes to the fairy tale "The Three Little Pigs," in which a werewolf-like character, the Big Bad Wolf, huffs and puffs and blows the houses of the pigs down. However, in this case, the werewolf is being sued for damaging a straw house, which is a play on the fact that the werewolf in the fairy tale is usually associated with blowing down houses made of straw.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it references the story of the big bad wolf and the three little pigs. In that story, the wolf huffs and puffs and blows the house down, but the house is made of straw. In this case, the werewolf businessman probably blew up a business deal (perhaps he was too aggressive, or maybe he threatened someone), and is being sued for $400,000. The other businessman is telling him that it's not worth getting worked up over, because the deal was as flimsy as the straw house from the story.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it references the classic fairy tale of "The Three Little Pigs" in which the big bad wolf huffs and puffs and blows the houses down. The first two houses are made of straw and wood, respectively, and are easily destroyed; the third house, made of bricks, withstands the wolf's onslaught. Thus, in this joke, the werewolf is surprised that his lawyers are demanding such a large sum of money for the destruction of the straw house, given how easily it was destroyed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it subverts the expectations of the classic fairy tale, "The Three Little Pigs." In the original story, the big bad wolf huffs and puffs and blows the house down, but in this case, the werewolf is the one being sued for damages after he blew the house down. The joke is made funnier by the werewolf's response, which is dismissive of the amount of money being sought in damages, as if the house wasn't worth very much to begin with.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the werewolf is indicating that the business-people are overreacting to the damage done by the werewolf. The werewolf is likely referring to the Three Little Pigs fairy tale, in which a wolf blows down a house made of straw, and the owners are greatly upset. However, the werewolf is pointing out that the business-people's houses are made of straw as well, which is much less sturdy, and yet they don't seem to be as worried about that.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the well-known story of the Three Little Pigs. In the original story, a big bad wolf tries to blow down the houses of the three little pigs, but he fails because the third pig's house is made out of strong bricks. In this version, the werewolf is the big bad wolf, and the 400 grand in damages is the cost of the straw house that he blew down.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common story of the big bad wolf blowing down the three little pigs' houses. In this case, the wolf is a werewolf, and the house is made of straw, which is presumably flammable and not very strong. The joke is that the werewolf is surprised that the house was only worth 400 dollars in damages, when it was so easily destroyed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the werewolf, who is usually associated with being savage and wild, and the business-people, who are usually associated with being civilized and orderly. The werewolf is dressed in a suit, which is a sign of professionalism, but he is also holding a suitcase, which could contain a change of clothes for when he transforms into his wolf form. The other business-people are probably imagining the werewolf transforming into his wolf form and savagely attacking them, but the werewolf is just as surprised as they are by the damages.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="57.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="59.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
