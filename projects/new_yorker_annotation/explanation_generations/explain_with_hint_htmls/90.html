The man at the party is asking the couple how their flight in was, but "united" can also mean "tied up." So, the man is asking the couple how their flight was while also making a comment on their current predicament.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the airlines are often delayed or cancelled, leaving passengers stranded. In this case, the woman is making a light-hearted joke about how the couple's flight must have been delayed or cancelled if they are now at the party, tied up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non-sequitur. The woman tieing up the people in the buckets could be asking about their experiences flying in on any airline, but she asked about United, which is known for being a terrible airline. The joke is funny because it is a contrast to the seriousness of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is asking a very normal question about someone's travel plans ("How was your flight in?"), but the two people she's asking are in a very strange and unusual situation (they're tied up and standing in buckets). The joke is funnier if you know that United Airlines is known for being a terrible airline, so the question is even more incongruous given the context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non-sequitur. The woman is asking about the flight but she is asking about an airlines that is known for being terrible. It's not a relevant question to the conversation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man talking to the couple does not seem to notice or care that they are tied up and clearly in distress. He just casually asks about their flight, as if it's a normal thing to ask a couple who appears to be hostages. The joke is a play on the fact that United Airlines has a reputation for being a terrible airline, so it's not surprising that even their hostages would have had a bad experience.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the couple is obviously in a very bad situation, the woman is making small talk with them as if they are just any other couple at the party. It's a dark joke because it's a play on the fact that many people find flying United to be a terrible experience.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The people at the party are "tied up" --- meaning, they are physically restrained --- and the woman asks them how their "flight in" was. The word "flight" can refer to an airplane journey, but it can also mean an escape from a difficult situation. In this case, the couple was probably restrained against their will, and the woman's joke is a way of asking if they managed to escape their captors.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the United Airlines flight is a reference to the infamous 2017 "United Airlines passenger removal incident" in which a bloodied man was forcibly dragged off an overbooked United flight. The fact that the couple is being treated so nonchalantly despite being tied up and in a compromising position is a play on how terrible (and some would say inhumane) United's customer service is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's an airline joke. The fact that the couple is tied up and have their feet in a bucket is a reference to the "cement shoes" mobsters often use to kill people; it's disconcerting that the other guests at the party don't seem to care that this couple is clearly in distress. The United Airlines joke is funny because United Airlines is often considered to be a terrible airline, and so the guest asking how their flight in was is unsympathetic and tone-deaf.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the airline's reputation: United Airlines is often ranked as one of the worst airlines, in terms of customer service. Given that the couple is tied up and their feet are in buckets, it's likely that their flight was not a pleasant one. The woman asking how their flight was with a smile on her face is thus irony.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person talking to the couple is making small talk, as if the couple being tied up with their feet in buckets of cement is a normal thing. This is a reference to the common practice of mobsters dumping people's bodies in the ocean with cement shoes so they will sink to the bottom and be hidden. The small talk about the couple's flight into town is a way of saying "How did you get here?" which is a common question people ask when they meet someone new.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is asking the couple about their flight, presumably to make small talk, but the couple is in a very awkward and uncomfortable position. The joke is also funny because United Airlines is known for being a terrible airline, so it's even more uncomfortable for the couple if they flew in on United.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman at the party is making small talk with the couple, who are tied up and have their feet in buckets of cement. It'simplied they are about to be killed, and the woman is just making conversation as if they've just arrived at the party. This is dark humor because it's making light of a situation that is usually considered quite serious.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man at the party is asking the couple how their "flight" was, but he is really asking how their "fight" was. The couple is tied up and looks like they have been in a fight, but they are actually hostages. The man's choice of words is funny because it is a double meaning.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="89.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="91.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
