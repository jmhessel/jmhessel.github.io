The woman's comment about seeing the end of the party can be interpreted two ways: that she sees the party collapsing, or that she sees the elephant's butt as it exits the room. The first interpretation is more likely, but the second interpretation is funnier because it's unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman brings up the topic of the elephant in the room, which is a reference to the fact that the Republican party's emblem is an elephant. The joke then takes a turn by saying that the woman is predicting the end of the Republican party. This could be interpreted as the woman foreseeing the collapse of the party, or, more literally, the end of the elephant's life.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "elephant in the room." The "elephant in the room" is often used to refer to a topic that is awkward or taboo, and which no one wants to talk about. In this case, the "elephant in the room" is the Republican party, which is in danger of collapsing. The joke is also funny because "end" can mean both the end of something, as in the demise of the party, and the body part (i.e., the backside or butt) of an elephant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "the end of the Republican party" can mean two things: the physical collapse of the party, or the end (butt) of the elephant in the room (i.e., the elephant that is the party).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The Republican party is often nicknamed "the elephant" because of their mascot, and the fact that they are a large, powerful party. In this case, the joke is implying that the end of the Republican party is coming, either due to them collapsing as an institution, or because an elephant is going to sit on them and squash them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the elephant in the room is a metaphor for the big problem that is being ignored. In this case, the big problem is the impending collapse of the Republican party. The joke is clever because it also references the fact that elephants have big butts, so the butt of the elephant is also a metaphor for the problem that is being ignored.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "end" of the Republican party can mean two things: the collapse of the party, or the end of the elephant (which is a symbol for the Republican party). The fact that the people in the room are ignoring the elephant is funny because it's a very large and hard-to-ignore thing, and it's also a symbol for a pressing issue that people often choose to ignore.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it relies on a double-meaning of the word "end." The first meaning is the more common one, in the sense of the "end" of the Republican party as a political entity. However, the second meaning is a more literal one, in the sense of the "end" of the elephant, which is in the room next to the man and woman. This second meaning is what makes the joke funny, because it's unexpected and suggests that the end of the elephant is also the end of the Republican party.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the phrase "elephant in the room" is often used to describe an issue that is being ignored or avoided. In this case, the elephant represent the Republican party, which is in decline. The joke is clever because it also plays on the double meaning of the word "end": it can mean the end of the Republican party, or it can mean the end (or backside) of the elephant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people in the room are ignoring the elephant in the room, which is a metaphor for the Republican party. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words: the end of the Republican party can mean both the literal collapse of the party, and the end of the elephant's body.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a double entendre. The elephant in the room is a metaphor for the Republican party, which is in decline. The end of the Republican party could mean the physical end of the party, or the end of their power. However, the second meaning of "end" is also a euphemism for "butt", which makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is talking about how the Republican party is falling apart, which is symbolized by the elephant in the room. "The end" can mean both the collapse of the party and the rear end of the elephant.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="74.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="76.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
