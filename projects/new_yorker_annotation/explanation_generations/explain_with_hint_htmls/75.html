Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime." In this scenario, the man is the fish, and the fish is trying to teach the man how to fish so that he can have a lifetime supply of food. However, the joke also has a dark subtext, in that the fish is essentially saying that he would rather be eaten than have to live his life being eaten by others.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of the situation, the man eating the fish is being offered helpful advice from the fish itself. The fish is trying to teach the man how to fish, which is a play on the idiom "Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime." The joke is clever because, in order to teach the man how to fish, the fish would need to be alive to do so, yet the man is currently in the process of eating it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the fish is trying to avoid being eaten by offering to teach the man how to fish. This is a play on the saying, "Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime." The joke is clever because, even though the fish is trying to be helpful, the man will still end up eating the fish in the end.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the idiom "give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime." In the idiom, the word "fish" is meant metaphorically, but in this joke, the fish is literal. The fish is trying to not be eaten by teaching the man how to fish, so that the man can catch his own food and not eat the fish on the plate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the saying "Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime." In this case, the fish is trying to not be eaten, and is suggesting that the man learn how to fish so that he can be self-sufficient. However, the man is still going to eat the fish regardless, so the joke is also a commentary on the saying itself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idiom "Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime." In this case, the man is trying to eat the fish, but the fish is trying to teach the man how to fish instead. This is funny because it's a reversal of the expected situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the saying "Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime." The man in the joke is literally being given a fish, but the fish is trying to teach the man how to fish, so that the man will not eat it. This reversal is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the play on words: the man is staring at a fish on his plate, and the fish is trying to not be eaten. The play on words is a reference to the saying "Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime." In this case, the man isn't being taught how to fish, he's being taught how not to eat fish.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the pun on the common saying "Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime." In this case, the fish is trying to prevent being eaten by offering to teach the man how to fish. This is humorous because it's a play on words: instead of being given a fish to eat, the man would be given the knowledge to catch his own fish in the future.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the idiom "Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime." In the situation, the man is about to eat the fish, but the fish is trying to teach the man how to fish so that he won't be eaten. The idiom is usually used to mean that it's better to teach someone how to do something so that they can be self-sufficient, but in this case, the fish is trying to use the idiom to save its own life.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the idiom "Give a Man a Fish, and You Feed Him for a Day. Teach a Man To Fish, and You Feed Him for a Lifetime" and the actual situation: instead of being given the opportunity to learn how to fish, the man is being offered the fish itself. The fish is trying to not be eaten, but the man is seemingly oblivious to this and is just focused on the fact that he's being offered a free meal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is trying to teach the fish how to fish. This is a play on the common saying "Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime." The joke is funny because, of course, it's impossible to teach a fish how to fish -- yet, the man is trying to do just that. Furthermore, the fish is in a unique position to learn how to fish, since it's already in the water!</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idiom "Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime." In this case, the man is being offered the chance to learn how to fish from the fish itself, which is an impossible scenario. The fish is trying to offer the man a way to not be eaten, but of course, the man can't actually learn how to fish from the fish.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the idiom "Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day.

The joke is that, instead of teaching the man how to fish, the fish is trying to teach the man how to not eat fish.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is about to eat the fish, which is still alive. The fish is trying to save itself by telling the man that if he teaches him how to fish, he won't have to eat him. The joke is also a play on the idiom "give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime."</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="74.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="76.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
