The man is then offering the Sphinx a job in Vegas, which is known for its replica landmarks on the strip, as if the Sphinx would fit in there.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person behind the desk is offering a job to the sphinx statue in front of him. The fact that the job is in Vegas is ironic because Vegas is famous for its replicas of famous landmarks, so the sphinx would fit right in.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Sphinx originally belongs in Egypt, but the man is reading from a paper that says the Sphinx is now in an office building. However, the fact that the Sphinx is in an office building means that it is now a replica, and the man is offering the Sphinx a job placement with other replica landmarks on the Las Vegas strip.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Sphinxes are ordinarily found in Egypt, but this one is found in an office building. The man telling the joke is suggesting that the Sphinx could get a job in Vegas, which is known for its replica landmarks and casinos. The joke is clever because it's a play on words; the Sphinx is a replica of a real landmark, so it would fit in well in Vegas.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the suit is behind a desk with a Sphinx sculpture in front of it, and he's saying that he might have a job for the Sphinx in Vegas. The word "vegas" can mean either "the city of Las Vegas, Nevada" or "the gambling/casino business." In this case, it's a pun because the man is saying that the Sphinx could get a job in the casino business in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is reading from a paper that says "Job Placement for Replica Sphinx Statue with other Replica Landmarks on Las Vegas Strip". The Sphinx originally belonged in Egypt, but was moved to the office, and now the man is trying to find a new home for it in Vegas. The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that many things in Vegas are replicas of landmarks from other places.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, given that the man is in an office and the sphinx is in front of him, it's likely that he's either interviewing the sphinx for a job or considering him for a job placement. However, the Sphinx is an Egyptian statue, so the most likely place he would be put to work would be in Las Vegas, where there are numerous replica landmarks on the strip.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it takes the Sphinx, which is a landmark that is thousands of years old and has a very long and complex history, and places it in the context of being a modern replica in Las Vegas, which is famous for its many replicas of landmarks from around the world. The joke is also funny because it implies that the man interviewing the Sphinx is considering giving her a job as a Vegas landmark, which is a humorous notion.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the suit is offering a job to the sphinx statue, which is a replica of the ancient Egyptian sphinx. The joke is clever because the man is suggesting that the sphinx go to work in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, which is known for its numerous replica landmarks, including a replica of the Sphinx.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is talking to the Sphinx as if it is a person who is looking for a job, and he is offering it a job in Las Vegas as a replica statue. This is funny because it is a play on words: the Sphinx is a landmark that is often replicated in Las Vegas, so the man is offering it a job as a replica of itself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Sphinx is an Egyptian landmark, and it's out of place in an office building. The man reading the paper is presumably looking at a job listing for the Sphinx, and the joke is that the only place that would have an opening for a Sphinx is Las Vegas, which is known for its replica landmarks.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the office is trying to find a job for the sphinx sculpture, and the only place he can think of that would have a need for it is Las Vegas, which is known for its replica landmarks. The man is essentially saying that the only place that would want the sculpture is a place that is known for being fake.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is offering a job to the person who made the sphinx statue, and the most likely place for such a job would be in Vegas. This is because the Vegas strip is full of replica landmarks, such as the Eiffel Tower, the Statue of Liberty, and the Sphinx.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Sphinx is a replica that is out of place in the office, and the man is offering a job placement for it in Vegas. This is funny because the Sphinx would fit in perfectly with the other replicas of landmarks on the Las Vegas strip.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The Sphinx is a replica that is located in front of the man's desk, and the man is saying that he may have a job placement for the Sphinx in Vegas. However, the word "placement" can also mean a gambling term, i.e., putting money on a certain spot on a casino game. So, the man is actually saying that he may have a gambling opportunity for the Sphinx in Vegas.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="100.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="102.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
