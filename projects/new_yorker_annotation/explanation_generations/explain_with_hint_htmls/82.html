In this case, instead of being a literal cat person, the speaker is saying that they are more impressed by the cat (which is not doing anything special) than by the dog, which is going above and beyond by dancing in a tutu.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The dog is "dancing" in an attempt to impress the people who are looking at it, but they are not impressed. The phrase "I'm just really more of a cat person" is often used to describe someone who is not impressed by dogs, which in this case is a literal statement.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is going to great lengths to try to please the people in the room, by dressing up like a ballerina and dancing, but it's still not enough. The joke is a clever way of saying that the person speaking doesn't really like dogs, in spite of this dog's best efforts.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is going to great lengths to entertain the people in the room (standing on two legs, dancing, wearing a tutu), but it's still not enough to please everyone. The statement at the end implies that the speaker is not impressed by the dog's performance, and would prefer a cat, which is typical in many ways.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a dig at how absurd it is for the dog to be dressed up like a ballerina. The joke implies that the people in the room are not impressed with the dog's performance, and that they would prefer to watch a cat instead. This is clever because it is a play on the common saying "that's just not my cup of tea", which is often used to reject things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a common trope that people either prefer dogs or cats. In this case, the person is saying they prefer cats because the dog is going above and beyond to try and impress them, and they still don't like dogs. The dog's extreme demonstration is unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The dog is "dancing" to try to impress the two people who are staring at it, but at the end of the day, one of them says that he is really more of a "cat person." This is a pun on the phrase "that's not my cup of tea," meaning that something isn't to your liking. In this case, the speaker is saying that he doesn't like dogs, even though the dog is going above and beyond trying to impress him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is going above and beyond to impress the people in the room by dressing up like a ballerina. However, the speaker says that, at the end of the day, they're just more of a cat person. This punchline implies that the speaker either doesn't appreciate the dog's effort or that they think the dog is putting on a comical show.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is going above and beyond to try to impress the people in the room, by dancing and wearing a tutu. The fact that the dog is doing human activities is surprising and humorous. The joke is also a play on the fact that some people prefer dogs while others prefer cats, suggesting that the speaker is more of a cat person because they would not be impressed by the dog's antics.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is doing something that is very above and beyond what is necessary, in an attempt to impress the people in the room. However, the speaker says that, at the end of the day, they're just more of a cat person. This implies that the speaker thinks that the dog is trying too hard and that they prefer cats, who are more low-maintenance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the stereotype that "cat people" are more highbrow and pretentious than "dog people". In this case, the dog is going literally above and beyond by donning a ballerina outfit in an attempt to be taken seriously as an art form, but it's not working. The joke is clever because it's not just making a simple contrast between the two groups of people, but it's actually using the stereotype to make a point about art and pretension.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is going above and beyond to impress the people in the room, by dressing up as a ballerina and performing for them. However, the speaker says that, at the end of the day, they're just more of a cat person. This implies that the speaker does not appreciate the dog's efforts, and find them to be excessive, which is ironic given that the dog is just trying to please the people in the room.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="81.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="83.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
