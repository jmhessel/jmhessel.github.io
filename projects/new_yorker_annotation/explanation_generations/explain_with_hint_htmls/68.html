The parrots are sitting around a table, as if they are having a meeting, and one of them says "can we talk?" This could be interpreted two ways: either the parrot is asking if they can have a discussion, or he's asking if they can literally talk, since birds typically don't talk. Either way, it's a funny joke because it's unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The parrots are trying to figure out if they literally can talk, or if they just mimic the sounds they hear. If they can talk, then they can hold a conversation --- which is presumably what they want to do. But, if they can't talk, then they can't hold a conversation. The joke is clever because it's a real conundrum that the parrots are facing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "can we talk" is often used to start a conversation, but in this case, the parrots are literally wondering if they can talk or not. The joke relies on the fact that parrots are often thought of as being able to talk, but in reality, they can only mimic sounds.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it questions whether or not the birds are capable of speech. If they could talk, they would presumably be having a conversation, but since they can't talk, they are just sitting there silently. The fact that they are in an office makes the joke even funnier, because it's an unlikely place for birds to be, and it adds to the idea that they are out of their element.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the parrots are asking each other whether they can talk or not, which implies that they are not sure. This is ironic because parrots are known for their ability to mimic human speech.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is ambiguous whether or not the birds are actually able to talk. If they can talk, then they are just stating the obvious. But if they can't talk, then they are betraying their avian nature by asking a question that can only be answered by birds who can talk. In either case, it's humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the four birds are sitting around a table in an office, as if they are about to have a business meeting. However, the fact that they are birds complicates this scenario: it's unclear if they are actually capable of holding a conversation, or if they are just repeating what they've heard other people say. This uncertainly is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The literal meaning of the phrase "Can we talk?" is a request for a conversation. However, the fact that the creatures asking this question are parrots implies that they are unsure if they literally can talk, or if they are just repeating words they've heard before. This play on words is humorous because it's unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. On the one hand, the birds are in an office, which implies that they are working and should be able to hold a conversation. However, the fact that they are birds means that they might not actually be able to talk, which is why they are asking if they can talk. This contrast is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because parrots are usually known for repeating words that they've heard, but they don't actually know the meaning of the words. In this case, the parrots are in a meeting and one of them asks if they can talk, suggesting that they are not sure if they literally can talk or not; this is funny because it's a play on the common saying "Can we talk?", meaning "Can we have a conversation?", which parrots would not be able to do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the birds are in a meeting, and one of them says "can we talk." This could mean two things: first, that the bird wants to start a discussion, or second, that the bird is wondering if it's capable of talking. The latter is funnier because it's unlikely that the bird is actually wondering if it can talk or not, since it's a bird.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's playing on the fact that birds can mimic human speech, but they don't actually understand what they're saying. In this case, the birds are in a meeting and one of them asks if they can talk, not realizing that they literally can't hold a conversation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The birds are parrots, which are known for their ability to mimic speech. However, in this situation, the parrots are wondering if they actually have the ability to talk, or if they just mimic what they hear. The double meaning of the word "talk" is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Can we talk?" can mean either "Can we have a conversation?" or "Can we parrots talk?". The parrots in the picture are unsure if they literally can talk or not, and so they are asking if they can hold a conversation. The joke is clever because it's a play on words that also highlights the absurdity of the situation --- parrots having a meeting in a room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it takes a common saying, "Can we talk?" and gives it a new meaning. In this case, the parrots are unsure if they literally can talk, or if they are just imitating what they've heard humans say. The doubleness of the meaning is what makes it humorous.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="67.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="69.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
