This is silly because it's unlikely that anyone would try to operate a washing machine in the middle of the desert without first making sure they had the necessary equipment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is common knowledge that solar panels are used to power things in the desert, but this couple didn't realize that their washing machine needed a solar panel to run, and so they are stuck doing their laundry by hand.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is in the middle of the desert trying to operate a washing machine, which obviously wouldn't work because there's no power source. The woman is reading the user manual, and the husband makes a joke about how they didn't buy the solar panel that would've been necessary to power the machine in the desert.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is reading the manual for their washing machine and it says that the solar panel needed to power it is sold separately. The couple is in the desert, so there is no way for them to power the machine. They are also dressed like they are at home, which makes the situation even more absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is in the middle of the desert trying to wash their clothes, but they can't because their washing machine is not solar powered. This is silly because in the middle of the desert, there is no other power source, so of course the washing machine would need to be solar powered.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is reading the user manual for the washing machine, and it says that the solar panel is sold separately. This is a problem because they are in the desert and there is no water, so they can't use the washing machine. The solar panel is necessary to power the machine, but it's not included, which is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is in the middle of the desert with a washing machine, but they can't use it because it didn't come with a solar panel. Solar panels are usually used to power things in the desert because there is no other source of power, so the fact that the washing machine didn't come with one is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is stranded in the desert with a washing machine that they can't use because it doesn't have a solar panel to power it. This is absurd because it's highly unlikely that they would have been able to find a washing machine in the middle of the desert in the first place, let alone one that doesn't come with a solar panel.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="78.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="80.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
