The contrast between the therapist's professional commitment to ending on time regardless of the circumstances and the potentially deadly situation he is in is what makes the joke humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully subverts the role of the therapist. In this situation, the therapist is supposed to be the one helping the patient deal with her issues, but he abruptly ends the session because he's being shot at. Thus, the patient's time is actually up because the therapist is being attacked, rather than the usual case where the therapist ends the session.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of a shootout, the therapist's time being up takes on a new meaning: the typical interpretation is that the person's time is up because their session is over, but in this case, it's because the therapist is about to be shot. The therapist's casual apology in the face of mortal danger is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's aSurprising reversal: in most cases, it's the patient who wants to end the therapy session early, but in this case, it's the therapist who wants to end the session early because he's being shot at. The fact that the therapist is being shot at is also unexpected, as therapists are not typically associated with gun violence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is being shot at, and he calmly says that his time is up, as if this is a normal, expected occurrence that happens at the end of therapy sessions. The joke is funny because it's a unexpected and logical reversal: usually, the therapist is the one who controls when the session ends, but in this case, the session is ending because the therapist is being shot at.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because therapists typically end sessions because their time is up, but in this case, the therapist's time is actually up because he's being attacked by gunfire. The juxtaposition of the normal scenario with the unusual circumstance makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The therapist's patient is being shot at, and the therapist says that his "time is up" --- in other words, the session is over because he's being attacked. This is a contrast to the usual scenario where the therapist would be the one to end the session.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The therapist is being attacked and his time is literally up, but the therapist is also indicating that the session is over because the time limit has been reached. In a normal therapy session, the therapist would be the one to end the session, but in this case, the situation is reversed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is being shot at and he's using the fact that his time is up as an excuse to end the session early. This is ironic because usually when people say their "time is up," it's because they want to end the conversation, but in this case, the therapist is literally being forced to end the conversation because his time is up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reversal of the standard format for a therapy session. In most cases, the therapist would be the one to end the session after the allocated time, but in this case, the session is ended for the therapist because he's under attack. The joke is clever because it's a play on words - the therapist's "time is up" because he's being shot at.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because therapists usually end sessions because their time is up, but in this case, the therapist's time is actually up because he's being attacked. The fact that he's being attacked by bullets makes the situation even more absurd and funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reversal of the therapist's normal power dynamic with the patient. In this case, the therapist is being shot at, and so he hastily ends the session early, rather than the patient being the one who is typically eager to leave. The power reversal is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common phrase "my time is up." In this case, the therapist's time is actually up because he's being shot at, and not because the session is over.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is being shot at, and his time is literally up because he's being attacked. In a normal scenario, the therapist would end the session because the time alloted for the patient has run out. However, in this situation, the therapist is being forced to end the session early because he's under attack.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is being shot at and his time is literally up. In a normal scenario, the therapist would end the session because the allotted time for the patient has ended, but in this case, the therapist is going to be killed before he can end the session. The irony is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="78.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="80.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
