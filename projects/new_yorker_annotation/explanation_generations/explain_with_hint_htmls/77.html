The joke is also funny because it's a play on words; sapiens is the scientific name for the human species, so the speaker is saying that they have humans crawling all over them. In a way, this is similar to saying "I have lice" because both are tiny creatures that infest creatures larger than themselves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woolly mammoth is telling the other mammoth to stay away because it has sapiens, which sounds like a disease where humans infest an animal like lice. In reality, the woolly mammoth has cavemen on top of it in a battle, which is a less dangerous but still potentially deadly situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the word "sapiens" sounds like a made-up disease, similar to "lice." In this case, the "disease" is actually a group of tiny humans (cavemen) riding on top of the woolly mammoth. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the caveman is telling the other woolly mammoth to stay back because he has humans on him, but the word "sapiens" makes it sound like he has a contagious disease.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "sapiens" is the scientific name for the human species, so it sounds like the mammoth is saying that it's infested with a disease of tiny humans. The fact that the humans are trying to hunt the mammoth and are having no effect makes it funnier, because it's a reversal of the usual predator-prey relationship.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it uses the similarity between the words "sapiens" and "lice" to make a pun. The speaker is warning the other mammoth not to get too close because they are infested with humans, who are small enough to be lice. This is silly because humans are not actually lice, and mammoths are not actually infested with them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the word "sapiens" sounds like a disease, and the speaker is saying that he has a lot of them. In actuality, of course, sapiens is the scientific name for the Homo sapiens species, to which the cavemen on the mammoth's back belong. So the speaker is saying that he has a lot of humans on his back, like lice. This is humorous because it is a play on words, and because it is a very unusual situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The mammoth is saying that he has sapiens, which is another word for humans, on him. However, because the word sapiens sounds similar to the word lice, it gives the joke a second meaning: that the mammoth is infested with humans, like one would be infested with lice. This is a play on the size difference between humans and mammoths, with the mammoth making a self-deprecating joke about how small humans are in comparison.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while "sapiens" is the scientific name for the Homo sapiens species, it also sounds like a disease that would cause one to be infested with small humans, like lice. In the context of the joke, the mammoth is saying that it's dangerous to get too close because it has humans on it, and these humans could potentially be lice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the word "sapiens" can mean two things: first, it's a genus of Homo, i.e., humans, and second, it can refer to the infestation of lice. In the context of the joke, the mammoth is saying that he has humans on him, i.e., he's being ridden by cavemen in a battle, but the way he phrases it --- "I have sapiens" --- makes it sound like he's infested with lice. This is funny because it's a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the misspelling of the scientific name for Homo sapiens, which is "Homo sapiens sapiens". In other words, the mammoth is saying that it has a disease of being infested with tiny humans, like lice. This is amusing because it implies that the cavemen are so small and insignificant that they can be considered a disease.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "sapiens" is the scientific name for the Homo sapiens species, of which cavemen are a part. However, the word "sapiens" can also mean "infested with tiny humans", which is what the mammoth is saying. The joke is clever because it plays on the double meaning of the word "sapiens".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of the mammoths, the word "sapiens" sounds like a disease that the mammoth has that causes it to be infested with humans. The small size of the humans in relation to the mammoth makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "sapiens" is the scientific name for the human species, but it also sounds like a disease or an infestation. The mammoth is telling the other mammoth not to get too close because it has humans on its back, which is similar to having a disease or being infested with something.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the mammoth is telling the other mammoth to stay away from him because he has sapiens, which sounds like a disease that would be caused by being infested with tiny humans, like lice. In reality, of course, sapiens is just the scientific name for the Homo sapiens species, to which all modern humans belong. So, the joke is playing on the idea that humans are so small and insignificant compared to mammoths, that they wouldn't even be worth mentioning unless they were causing some sort of problem.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the word "sapiens" sounds like a disease that would be caused by being infested with tiny humans, like lice. In the context of the mammoths, the joke is that the mammoth with the cavemen on it is saying that the other mammoth should stay back, because it has sapiens (tiny humans) on it, which makes it sound like the mammoth is infested with a disease.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="76.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="78.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
