However, the fact that these people are wearing hazmat suits is overkill, and it points to the fact that they are probably taking unnecessary precautions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is going to such extremes to avoid getting the flu (by wearing hazmat suits to bed), when the flu is such a common illness that can be prevented relatively simply with a flu shot.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is wearing hazmat suits, which are typically only worn in cases of extremely hazardous materials or environments. The implication is that they are taking extreme precautions to avoid getting the flu, when the flu is a relatively minor illness. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: "shots" can mean either a vaccination or an alcoholic beverage. In this case, it is a reference to the flu shot, a vaccine.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is taking such extreme measures to avoid getting sick by wearing full hazmat suits to bed, when usually, people just get flu shots to avoid getting sick. The contrast between the two methods is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the level of protection that hazmat suits offer is excessive for the common flu. Furthermore, the idea of having to put on a hazmat suit just to have sex is unappealing and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, normally, people would not go to such extremes to protect themselves from the flu---wearing a hazmat suit is overkill. Furthermore, the joke is clever because it can be interpreted in two ways: either the speaker is saying that it would be easier to just get a flu shot next time (i.e. before they have sex), or they are saying that it would be easier to have sex with someone if they were both wearing hazmat suits (to protect themselves from each other).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the couple is clearly taking precautions to avoid getting sick, they are going about it in a very extreme way by wearing hazmat suits to bed. This is overkill because, usually, getting a simple flu shot is enough to protect against the flu.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, although flu shots are generally considered to be good idea to prevent getting the flu, the level of protection offered by a flu shot is far less than that of a hazmat suit. Thus, the two people in the joke are effectively saying that, next time, they would prefer to get a flu shot instead of going through the hassle of wearing hazmat suits in bed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people in the hazmat suits are taking extreme precautions to avoid getting the flu. However, this is overkill because the flu is a relatively mild illness, and most people don't take such precautions to avoid it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while normally, getting flu shots is a simple, yearly precaution, this couple has gone to the extreme of wearing full hazmat suits to bed in order to avoid getting sick. This is overkill because, even though the flu can be dangerous, it's not usually dangerous enough to warrant such extreme safety measures.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually, people just get flu shots to avoid getting the flu, but this couple is going way overboard by wearing full hazmat suits. This is overkill and excessive, and it's funny because it's a contrast to the normal way of doing things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people are taking such extreme precautions to avoid getting the flu, by wearing hazmat suits, that it's excessive. It would be much easier, and less hassle, to simply get flu shots like everyone else. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the phrase "call me old-fashioned," which is often used when someone is discussing their traditional values. In this case, the tradition is getting a flu shot.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is taking an extreme measures to protect themselves from the flu by wearing hazmat suits to bed. This is overkill because the flu is not an airborne illness and so the suits are unnecessary. Furthermore, the joke suggests that the couple is so worried about getting the flu that they are willing to sacrifice comfort by sleeping in the suits.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people in the hazmat suits are taking extreme measures to protect themselves from getting sick. However, the flu is a relatively minor illness, and getting a flu shot is a much more common and reasonable solution.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people are taking excessive precautions to avoid getting the flu by wearing hazmat suits. However, the flu is much less serious than something that would warrant wearing a hazmat suit, so their precautions are overkill. The punchline is that, instead of continuing to take these extreme precautions, they could just get flu shots like everyone else --- a much simpler and more effective solution.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="25.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="27.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
