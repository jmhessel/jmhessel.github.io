When a pig is roasted, it is often done with an apple in its mouth. So, when the pig eats an apple, it looks like it is being roasted, and people think it is dead. But, of course, pigs are not actually dead when they are roasted; they are just cooked. In the same way, the pig eating the apple is just eating, not actually dead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in many countries, pigs are roasted with apples in their mouths. This is often done as a decoration, but it also has the effect of making the pig appear to be dead, with the apple as its makeshift tombstone.

A roasted pig is typically served with an apple in its mouth, and so when the pig complains that people assume he's dead when he eats an apple, the reader understands that he is referring to the fact that he is often served as a meal. This is a clever way to talk about the discrimination that pigs face, as they are commonly eaten by humans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the stereotype that pigs are dirty animals. When a pig eats an apple, it is usually because they are going to be roasted and the apple is placed in their mouth as part of the cooking process. As a result, the pig's complaint—that every time he eats an apple, people assume he's going to be roasted—reflects the way that people see pigs as nothing more than food.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The pig is saying that when he eats an apple, people automatically assume that he is dead, because pigs are traditionally roasted with an apple in their mouth.

When people see a pig with an apple in its mouth, they assume that the pig is dead and being roasted.
