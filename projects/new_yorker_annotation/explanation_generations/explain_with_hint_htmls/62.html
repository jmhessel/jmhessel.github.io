The woman's fault is that she didn't tip the movers, which caused the movers to leave their couch upside down. This is unexpected because it's not usually the woman's responsibility to tip the movers, and it's not usually the movers' responsibility to leave the couch upside down if they don't get a tip.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is saying that the reason they are in this predicament is because they didn't tip the movers, which is a common practice when someone helps you move furniture into your home. However, in this case, the movers have taken things too literally and have left the couch upside down because they weren't given a tip.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couch being upside down is a result of the movers not being tipped. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the phrase "tip the movers" can mean two things, either giving them a gratuity for their services or to actually tip the physical couch that they are moving. In this case, the latter meaning is implied, and the joke is that the people on the couch didn't do that, causing the movers to just leave the couch upside down.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "tip the movers" can mean two things: 1) giving a gratuity to the movers for their services and 2) tipping the couch over so that the movers can put it in the desired location. In this situation, the man and woman did not tip the movers (gratuity) and as a result, the movers left the couch in an upside down position.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is telling the woman that she didn't tip the movers, and because of that, they left the couch upside down. This is funny because it's a literal interpretation of the phrase "I told you so." The woman didn't listen to the man's advice, and now they are literally upside down because of it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reverse cause and effect. In the real world, if you don't tip your movers, they might be angry with you or do a subpar job. However, in this joke, not tipping the movers led to an extreme consequence: they left the couch upside down. This could be seen as karma for the person who didn't tip, as they now have to live in an upside down room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is in an unusual situation, hanging from their furniture which is upside down on the ceiling. This is because they didn't tip the movers, so the movers got revenge by flipping their furniture over. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the couple is "upside down" because their furniture is upside down, and they are also upside down in the physical sense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man and woman were expecting the movers to leave their couch right-side up, but because they didn't tip the movers, the movers left the couch upside down as revenge. This humorous outcome is a result of the characters' expectations (that the couch would be right-side up) not being met.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is absurd: the people on the sofa are on the ceiling because they didn't tip the movers, who in turn got revenge by leaving the couch upside down. This is a clever way to avoid a conflict (by leaving the couch upside down, the movers don't have to face the people again), but it is also a very silly way to handle the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man and woman are upside down and their couch is too. This is because they didn't tip the movers, so the movers got revenge by leaving the couch upside down. This is frustrating for the man and woman because now they have to clean up the mess below them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is saying that if they had given a tip to the movers, the couch would have been placed right-side up, instead of upside down. The woman is likely to be upset because she didn't realize that not tipping the movers would result in this outcome.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is telling the woman that she should have tipped the movers, meaning that she should have given them a gratuity for their services. However, the movers didn't do a very good job, as evidenced by the couch being upside down, and so the woman probably shouldn't have given them a tip.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The couple didn't "tip" the movers, meaning they didn't give them a gratuity, but instead they "tipped" the couch, meaning they overturned it. The result is that the couch is now upside down, and the couple is hanging from the ceiling.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "tip the movers" usually means to give them a cash tip for their services in moving something like a couch. However, in this case, the couch was not properly tipped (i.e., given a cash tip), and so the movers left it upside down as a way of getting back at the customer.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Tipping" can mean giving someone a gratuity for good service, or it can mean toppling something over. In this case, the couple didn't give a tip to their furniture movers, so the movers took revenge by leaving the couch upside down.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="61.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="63.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
