In that show, contestants are presented with three doors, behind one of which is a grand prize (often a car). The other two doors usually have jokes prizes like a toaster or a trip to the Bahamas. The man in the joke clearly regrets not choosing the car, as indicated by his comment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is acting as if he made a mistake by not winning a car on a game show. Instead, he won a toaster, which is much less valuable. This is a play on the common saying "should have gone with my gut," or in this case, should have chosen the car instead of the toaster.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the game show trope where a contestant wins a less desirable prize than the other options. In this case, the man with the hose is watering down a toaster, something that is not usually done, instead of a car. He probably regrets his decision to take the toaster, instead of the car, hence the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idiom "I should have known better," which is usually said in hindsight after making a poor decision. In this case, the man is clearly regretting his decision to wash the toaster, as he is getting wet and the toaster is not. The joke is made funnier by the fact that he is using a hose, which implies that he is using a lot of water to try to clean the toaster. This is a reference to the game show "The Price is Right," where contestants can choose to take an item or cash prize. In this case, the man chose to take the toaster (door number 1), but wishes he had chosen the car (door number 2) instead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the game show clich√© where a contestant regrets not choosing the more valuable prize behind one of the other doors. In this case, the man won a toaster, but he's realized that it wasn't the best prize, and he's regretting not winning the car that was behind the other door.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is regretting his decision to wash the toaster, which was likely given to him as a prize on a game show. "Door number 2" is often used as a euphemism for an alternate or second choice, and in this case, the man wishes he had chosen the second prize, a car, instead of the toaster. The joke is clever because it is a play on words and also because it is a play on the game show cliche of winning a toaster instead of a car.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is washing a toaster as if it's a car. This is a reference to the game show "The Price is Right," where contestants can choose to take an alternate prize if they don't want the item that is being offered. In this case, the man appears to regret not taking the alternate prize, which was probably a car (a more desirable prize than a toaster).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the famous game show "Let's Make a Deal". On that show, contestants are presented with two options, usually one being something valuable and the other being something undesirable. In this case, the contestant chose the toaster, which was the undesirable prize, instead of the car, which was the valuable prize. The joke is funny because it's a play on words --- the man obviously regrets his decision to wash the toaster, but he's also referencing the game show and his regret at not choosing the car.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to the game show "Let's Make a Deal," in which contestants choose one of three doors, behind one of which is a grand prize (often a car) and the other two of which have comparatively worthless prizes (often a goat or a toaster). The joke is that, in this case, the man chose the door with the toaster, and is now regretting his decision.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "should have chosen door number 2." In game shows, often there is a choice between two prizes, with one being significantly better than the other. In this case, the man regretfully chose the toaster (door number 1), when he could have had a car (door number 2).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is regretting his choice to wash the toaster, which was given to him as a prize on a game show. But he's also regretting his choice of which door to pick on the game show, as if he had picked the other door, he would have won a car instead of the toaster. The joke is clever because it's a play on the phrase "door number two", which is often used when there are two equally good options.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the classic game show "Let's Make a Deal." In the game show, contestants are asked to choose between door number 1, door number 2, or door number 3. Often, door number 1 has a low-value prize like a toaster, door number 2 has a middle-value prize like a trip, and door number 3 has a high-value prize like a new car. Clearly, the man wishes he had chosen door number 3, but instead he is stuck with door number 1.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="61.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="63.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
