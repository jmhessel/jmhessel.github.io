The fact that he is using a sabre --- which is a type of sword --- to do something so mundane as removing the crusts is what makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is using an excessively large and impractical sword to remove the crusts from his bread. It's overkill because a knife would suffice to remove crusts, but the man is using a sword as if he's in battle.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Viking is using an unnecessarily large and dangerous weapon, a sword, to cut the bread, when a more appropriate tool, like a knife, would suffice. The woman in the back is presumably his wife or servant, and she is scolding him for not just using a knife to remove the crusts, as she presumably told him to do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is using a sword to cut his Toast, which is overkill. If he had just asked for the Toast without crust, the woman could have given him what he wanted without him having to use his sword. However, because he is using such a large and dangerous weapon to do such a small and mundane task, it's comedic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Viking is using an absurdly large and overkill weapon, a sword, to remove the crusts from the bread. This is a reference to the stereotype of Vikings as warriors who were often violent and overzealous. The woman in the back is probably the wife of the Viking, who is exasperated at his lack of understanding of her simple request.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is using an absurdly large and inappropriate weapon to remove the crust from his toast. He could have simply used a butter knife, but instead, he chose to use a giant sword. This overkill is juxtaposed with the woman in the background going about her day as usual, emphasizing the absurdity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Mongol warrior is using an absurdly large and dangerous weapon to do a very simple task. The housewife is unimpressed, and the joke implies that the warrior is overkill in everything he does.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is using an absurdly large and unnecessary weapon to remove the crusts from his toast, when a much smaller and more appropriate tool, like a knife, would suffice. The joke is also a play on words, because the phrase "if you didn't want X, you should have said so" is often used as a way to tell someone that they should have been more specific in order to avoid getting something they don't want. In this case, the man should have been more specific about not wanting crusts, or else he would have gotten toast with crusts.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is using an unnecessarily large and dangerous weapon to remove the crusts from his bread. It's a play on the idea that some people are so picky about their food that they will go to great lengths to make sure it is "just right."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is overkill to use a giant sword to remove the crusts from a piece of toast. The joke would be even funnier if, instead of being distracted, the housewife was Reaction Giffing in horror at the destruction being wrought in her kitchen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the viking is using an unnecessarily large and dangerous weapon to remove the crusts from his bread. This is overkill, and the joke is poking fun at the viking's misplaced violence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is using an absurdly large sword to remove the crust from the piece of toast, when a regular knife would have sufficed. The joke is a play on the phrase "overkill," which means to use more force/resources than necessary. In this case, the man is using an absurd amount of force to remove the crust, when a normal knife would have done the job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Mongol warrior is using an absurdly large sword to remove the crust from the toast, when a much smaller knife would have sufficed. The joke is a play on the idea of overkill, or using more force than necessary.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the proportion of the object being cut (a piece of toast with egg) is very small compared to the size of the knife (a giant sword). It's absurd to think that anyone would need to use such a large knife to remove the crusts from a piece of toast, and so the joke is a play on the idea of overkill.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Viking is using an unnecessarily large and dangerous weapon to remove the crusts from the bread. The woman in the back is probably the Viking's wife or mother, and she is scolding him for making such a mess and wasting food.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="85.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="87.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
