The man is looking at the stairway to heaven, which is a very remote location, and saying that the person who is in heaven is working remotely. This is a play on words because usually when someone is working remotely, they are still on Earth, but in this case, the person is working from heaven, which is very far away.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in the office is looking at the path to heaven and remarking that the person they are talking to must be working remotely from heaven this week. This is humorous because it's a play on the phrase "working from home", which is a common way for people to work remotely nowadays. The joke is clever because it's based on the double-meaning of the word "remote", meaning both "far away" and "not in-person".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in the office is looking at the path to heaven, which has opened up outside their window, and they remark that the person they are speaking to on the phone is working remotely from heaven this week. This is funny because it's a play on the phrase "working from home," which usually means working from one's house instead of going into the office, but in this case, the person is working from heaven, which is even further away than one's house.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in the office is looking at the path to heaven, which has opened up outside the window. This is a surreal situation, and the joke makes light of it by saying that the person is just working remotely from heaven instead of from their home or some other remote location. The joke is also clever because it's a play on the phrase "working from home."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because instead of the person working remotely from their home or another location on Earth, they are working remotely from heaven. This joke plays with the idea of remote work, which is already strange and foreign to many people, and takes it to an extreme.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully imagines what it would be like if instead of working from home or another office location, someone was able to work remotely from heaven. The image of the person sitting at a desk in heaven, with a phone to their ear, is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is working remotely from heaven, which is an unusual and unexpected location. The joke is even funnier if the man is deceased, which would mean that he's working from heaven in the afterlife.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it puns on the phrase "working remotely." In this case, the person has gone to such an extreme remote location --- heaven --- that it's impossible for them to actually get any work done. The joke is funnier if you imagine the person continuing to try to work from heaven, struggling to find good WiFi and a place to plug in their laptop.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it uses the familiar phrase "working remotely" to describe a very atypical situation: instead of working from home or from a coffee shop like most people who work remotely, this person has instead gone all the way to heaven. This is a play on words because "remote" can mean both "far away" and "not in person."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is clearly not working from heaven, despite what it may look like. The joke is playing on the fact that "working remotely" has become a more common way to work in recent years, with people often working from home or other locations outside of the office. In this case, the man has taken the idea of working remotely to a literal extreme by working from heaven, which is clearly not what most people mean when they say they are working remotely.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's coworkers probably think he's just working remotely from a usual location, like his home. But in reality, he's working remotely from heaven. This punchline playfully imagines what it would be like if someone could actually work from heaven.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's office is in a location that is so remote, he might as well be working from heaven. This is a play on the idiom "working from home," which usually refers to working remotely via computer, but in this case, the man is so remote, he's actually working from the afterlife.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person has observed what appears to be a gateway to heaven opening up outside their office window. However, instead of being amazed or excited by this, they are nonchalant because they know that the person they are speaking to on the phone is simply working remotely from heaven this week. This joke is clever because it pokes fun at how commonplace working remotely has become.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person on the phone is telling the person they're talking to that the person they want to talk to is working remotely this week. The joke is funny because instead of the typical work-from-home locations like a coffee shop or a library, the person has instead gone to heaven, which is an absurd location to try and work from.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the concept of "working remotely." Instead of working from home or some other usual remote location, the man in the joke is working from heaven, which is an unusual and unexpected remote location.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="93.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="95.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
