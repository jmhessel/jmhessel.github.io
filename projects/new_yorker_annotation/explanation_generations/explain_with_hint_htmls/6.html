However, in Georgia (and a few other states), the law is reversed: it is legal to offer food and drink to voters, as long as it is not done in a way to influence how they vote. Thus, the fact that the grim reaper, who is known for taking lives, is handing out refreshments to voters, is a humorous way of highlighting the backwards nature of Georgia's law.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to a law in Georgia that says only refreshments that have been "pre-approved" by the state can be given to voters within 150 feet of a polling place. The grim reaper is giving out lemons, which are not pre-approved, but because he is death, he is not bound by the law.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to a law in the US state of Georgia that prohibits giving food and drink to voters within 150 feet of a polling place. The law is designed to prevent people from bribing voters, but it has the effect of preventing anyone from giving out refreshments, even if they're not trying to bribe anyone. In this case, the person giving out refreshments is Death, who is not subject to the laws of mortals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in the United States, it is illegal to give gifts or food to people in exchange for their vote. However, in Georgia, the law is reversed: it is legal to give food to people in exchange for their vote, as long as the food is distributed by the person or organization running the polling place. In this situation, the grim reaper is the only one who can legally hand out refreshments to voters, because he is technically a "poll worker."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it references a backwards law in the US state of Georgia, where it is legal for the grim reaper to hand out refreshments to voters, but not for anyone else. This is because the law is written so that only "living" people are prohibited from giving out refreshments, and since the grim reaper is technically not "alive", he is exempt from the law.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in Georgia, it is illegal to offer food or drink to voters within 150 feet of a polling place. However, because the Grim Reaper is technically not alive, he is not bound by this law and can freely hand out refreshments.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that, in some parts of the United States, it is illegal to offer food or drink to voters within a certain proximity of a polling place. The grim reaper is giving people lemons, which can be seen as a refreshing beverage, and thus he is technically breaking the law. However, because he is the personification of death, he is exempt from the rule.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to a law in the state of Georgia that regulates who can hand out food and drink to voters waiting in line at polling places. The law is seen as backwards by many people, because it is designed to prevent voter fraud but in practice it can just be a way to make it harder for people to vote. In the joke, death is giving out food to a man, and the woman is off to the side. This is a reference to the fact that under the law, only certain people are allowed to hand out food and drink, and death is the only one who is legally allowed to do so.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Grim Reaper is giving out lemons, which is a reference to the idiom "when life gives you lemons, make lemonade." The joke is clever because in Georgia, there is a law that prohibits campaigning within 150 feet of a polling place, which would include giving out refreshments. However, since the Grim Reaper is technically not alive, he is exempt from this law and can hand out refreshments to voters.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in the US state of Georgia, it is illegal to hand out food or drink to voters within 150 feet of a polling place. However, because the grim reaper is a personification of death, he is exempt from this law --- hence, he is the only one who can hand out refreshments to voters.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the grim reaper is handing out refreshments to voters in Georgia, which is a state with very strict polling laws. The fact that the grim reaper is the only one who can legally hand out refreshments to voters is a play on the fact that he is often associated with death.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it elephants a common trope --- that the grim reaper is a figure who takes life, rather than giving it. However, in this case, the grim reaper is handing out lemons, which is a type of refreshment, to a man in Georgia. The joke is clever because it points out that the only person who can legally hand out refreshments to voters in Georgia is the grim reaper, because he is the only person who is legally allowed to be around dead bodies.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in the U.S. state of Georgia, only certain types of food and drink are allowed to be given to voters waiting in line at polling places on election day. These refreshments, called "Get Out the Vote" (GOTV) foods, are meant to sustain voters so that they can wait in line and cast their ballot. However, the law only allows for water to be given out, not any other type of food or drink. So, if someone wanted to hand out snacks, they would need to get creative and find someone who could lawfully do so --- in this case, Death.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the grim reaper, who is usually associated with taking life away rather than giving life-affirming gifts, handing out lemons. The punchline emphasizes this incongruity by explaining that the only way he could do such a thing is because of the backwards polling laws in the state of Georgia.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to the recent Georgia law that prohibits people from giving out food or drink to voters while they are waiting in line to vote. The law was seen as restrictive, because it would prevent people from handing out refreshments to voters on hot days, for example. However, the law exempts the Grim Reaper, because he is legally considered to be part of the poll workers. Thus, the only person who can hand out refreshments to voters in Georgia is the Grim Reaper.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="5.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="7.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
