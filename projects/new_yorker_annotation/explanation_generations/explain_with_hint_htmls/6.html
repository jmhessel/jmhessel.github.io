This is a play on the stereotype that older generations are not up-to-date on trends and fashion.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a joke about how old-fashioned and out-of-touch the dog wearing the cone is. The cone is supposed to stop the dog from scratching itself, but because it's on backwards, it's not actually doing its job. The other dog says that no one wears their cone like that anymore, implying that there's a more modern way to wear the cone, and Dad is just behind the times.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is true that Elizabethan collars, or "e-collars", the industry standard term, have a certain way that they are worn, with the rounded end towards the back of the neck, and the open end in front. The dog wearing it backwards is likely old and out of touch, like someone who would still use the word "hip" instead of "cool".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the generational difference: the dog on the left is pointing out that the way the dog on the right is wearing his cone is not cool or fashionable anymore. The joke is clever because it's using the concept of "being hip" to talk about something as mundane as how a dog wears their Elizabethan collar.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it points out how dogs, like people, can be fashion-conscious and that trends in cone-wearing can change. In this case, the newer, more hip way to wear a cone is backwards, and the older dog is not up on the latest trends.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the older dog is wearing the cone in the traditional way, the younger dog is pointing out that the newer, more hip way to wear the cone is backwards. This is a play on the idea that older people are not as in touch with current trends and fashion.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the trend of children thinking their parents are uncool because they don't dress hip or wear the latest styles. In this case, the child dog is saying that the older dog's cone is not only unfashionable, but the fact that it's backwards makes it even more uncool.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the idea that dads/older people wear clothes that are out of style. In this case, the older dog is wearing the cone "out of style" -- the new style is to have the pointy part of the cone facing the back, so that the dog can't scratch itself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the amateur way the dog on the left is wearing his cone: it is backwards, which presumably means it isn't doing its job of protecting the dog's injury. The dog on the right is pointing this out to his dad, who is presumably the one wearing the cone. The joke is clever because it not only makes a commentary on how out-of-touch old people can be with current trends, but also how they can be bad at following simple instructions (like reading the packaging on the cone collar).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the dogs is wearing his Elizabethan collar, which is used to prevent animals from scratching themselves, in an "uncool" way. The other dog implies that the way his dad is wearing the cone is outdated, and that the new way to wear it is with the point facing the other direction.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one dog is making fun of the other dog's cone, saying that it's old-fashioned. The cone is supposed to go around the dog's neck, but this dog has it on backwards. The joke is a play on words because "cone" can also refer to a type of clothing worn by people in the 1970s that is no longer fashionable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the implied comparison between old-fashioned clothes that dads wear and the old-fashioned way that the dog is wearing its cone. The new, more hip way to wear the cone is with the pointy end facing out, not in.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="5.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="7.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
