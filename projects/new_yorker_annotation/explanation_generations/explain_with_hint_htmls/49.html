The joke implies that the pianist could have been a conductor, but didn't because he prefers to play the piano, even though it's more difficult.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is difficult to play the piano with boxing gloves on. The man is saying that if he had been a conductor, it would have been much easier, as all he would have had to do is hold a baton.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, although the man is clearly struggling to play the piano with boxing gloves on, he remarks that he could have been a conductor. This is funny because a conductor does not need to be able to play the instruments to conduct them; they simply need to be able to keep time and wave a baton around. The man implies that he would have been better off if he had chosen a profession where not being able to play an instrument wouldn't have been a hindrance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because boxing gloves make it difficult to do fine motor tasks like playing the piano. The fact that the man is in a concert hall implies that he is a musician, and the joke is that he could have been a conductor, which is a much easier job to do while wearing boxing gloves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the man is trying to play the piano, he is wearing boxing gloves. This makes it difficult for him to play the piano, as the gloves make it hard to press the keys. He says that he could have been a conductor, which is a more appropriate profession for someone wearing gloves, as they need to hold a baton.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the pianist is clearly struggling to play the piano with boxing gloves on, which makes it difficult to press the keys. This is in contrast to a conductor, who uses a baton to direct an orchestra, which is much easier to hold with gloves on. The joke punchline implies that the pianist could have been a conductor if he had chosen a more sensible career path.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is wearing boxing gloves, which makes it difficult for him to play the piano. The joke is that he could have been a conductor, which is a profession that is much easier to do while wearing gloves. The irony is that the man chose to be a pianist, which is a more difficult profession, and is now struggling because of his choice to wear gloves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is wearing boxing gloves, which make it difficult to play the piano. The man is saying that if he had been a conductor, he could have easily held a baton, the tool that conductors use. The joke is clever because it's true --- it is much easier to hold a baton than to play the piano, even though most people think the reverse is true.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because playing the piano with boxing gloves on is difficult, and the man is clearly struggling. However, if he had been a conductor, he could have easily held a baton with his gloves on. The joke implies that he chose the wrong profession.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the pianist is clearly struggling to play the piano with his boxing gloves on. He says he could have been a conductor, which is a less physically demanding job, but he chose to be a pianist instead. This is a play on the common saying "I could have been a contender" which implies that the speaker had the potential to be great at something but didn't fulfill that potential. In this case, the pianist did fulfill his potential, but not without some comedic difficulty.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is wearing boxing gloves, which would make it difficult to play the piano. The joke is punning on the fact that conductors often wear gloves when they direct an orchestra; this is because the gloves make it easier to hold a baton, which is a conductor's primary tool.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the pianist is wearing boxing gloves, which would make it difficult to play the piano. The joke is making a pun on the phrase "I could have been a contender", which suggests that the pianist could have been successful if he had chosen a different profession. In this case, the pianist suggests that he would have been a conductor, which is much easier than playing the piano with boxing gloves on.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the pianist is clearly not able to play the piano with boxing gloves on. This is a play on the fact that boxing gloves make it difficult to do fine motor tasks, like playing the piano. The joke is also funny because it is a reversal: usually, people who are good at playing the piano dream of becoming conductors, but in this case, the pianist is regretting not becoming a conductor because it would have been much easier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is wearing boxing gloves, which makes it difficult for him to play the piano. This is a reference to the common saying "I could have been a contender," from the movie "On the Waterfront." In that movie, the protagonist, who is a boxer, says that line to lament his lost potential. In this case, the man is saying that he could have been a conductor, which is someone who leads an orchestra, if he had not chosen to become a pianist. The joke is emphasizing the contrast between the two professions: boxers use their fists to fight, while conductors use their hands to direct an orchestra; the former is considered to be brutish, while the latter is considered to be refined.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the pianist is wearing boxing gloves, which would make it difficult to play the piano.
