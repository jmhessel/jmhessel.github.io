The joke implies that the whale is on trial for eating a penguin, and the whale's lawyer is trying to use the defense that the penguin had a gun, so the whale was just defending himself. This is ironic because, usually, it's the person on trial who tries to use self-defense as a justification, and not their lawyer.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the killer whale is on trial for killing a penguin, and its lawyer is trying to plea self-defense. The absurdity of a killer whale needing to plead self-defense for eating a penguin is what makes this joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is absurd: a killer whale is on trial for eating a penguin, and the whale's lawyer is trying to plead self-defense. The absurdity is compounded by the fact that killer whales are much larger than penguins, making the self-defense claim seem even more far-fetched.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is absurd: a whale is on trial for eating a penguin, and the whale's lawyer is trying to argue self-defense. This is absurd because, while whales are predators and do eat penguins, it is not typically considered self-defense because the whales are so much bigger than the penguins.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the whale is on trial for eating a penguin, and his lawyer is arguing that the whale was acting in self-defense because the penguin had a gun. The joke is a play on the common legal defense that someone was acting in self-defense because they reasonably believed that the other person was armed and dangerous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the absurdity of a whale being on trial for eating a penguin. The whale's lawyer is trying to defend him by saying that the penguin had a gun, implying that the whale was acting in self-defense. However, the fact that the penguin is a bird and would therefore unlikely to have a gun makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's absurd: the idea of a whale on trial for eating a penguin is ridiculous, as is the idea that the whale could plead self-defense. It's even more absurd that the lawyer would object to the other lawyer on the grounds that the penguin had a gun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The lawyer is saying that his client (the whale) maintains that the penguin had a gun. However, the word "gun" can also mean "flipper" --- so the lawyer is technically saying that his client (the whale) maintaining that the penguin had a flipper. Of course, this is absurd, because penguins don't have guns (or flippers).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is so absurd: a whale is on trial for eating a penguin, and its lawyer is trying to defend it by saying the penguin had a gun. The idea of a whale being on trial is already funny, but the lawyer's argument makes it even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of a killer whale on trial for eating a penguin. The joke is made even funnier by the fact that the whale's lawyer is objecting to the other lawyer's line of questioning on the grounds that the penguin might have had a gun --- even though, of course, penguins don't typically carry guns.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the whale's lawyer is objecting to the other lawyer on the grounds that his client was acting in self-defense when he ate the penguin. This is ridiculous because, first of all, whales are carnivores so eating penguins is not out of the ordinary for them. Second, even if the penguin did have a gun, it is highly unlikely that a whale would be able to tell whether or not the penguin was going to use it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common phrase "the who had a gun." In this case, instead of a person, it is a whale on trial for eating a penguin. The whale's lawyer is trying to claim self-defense, saying that the penguin had a gun. This is absurd, of course, because penguins don't typically carry guns.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is absurd to think that a whale would be on trial for eating a penguin. The joke is also funny because the whale's lawyer is trying to plead self-defense, even though it is quite clear that the whale is the aggressor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "The man had a gun." In this situation, the whale is on trial for eating a penguin, and the lawyer is trying to defend the whale by saying that the penguin had a gun. This is absurd because penguins don't typically carry guns, and even if they did, it's not likely that they would use them against a whale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the legal term "self-defense". In this case, the whale is on trial for eating a penguin, and his lawyer is trying to argue that the whale was acting in self-defense because the penguin had a gun. This is absurd because penguins don't typically carry guns, and even if they did, a whale would be much larger and more powerful than a penguin and wouldn't need to worry about self-defense.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="71.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="73.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
