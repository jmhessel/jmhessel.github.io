A lifesaver is a type of candy, but it's also a safety device used to rescue people from drowning. The fact that the only potential rescue option is something that would kill them is both dark and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is stranded on a tiny island, observing another island that appears to be near, with giant versions of a type of food that is typically small. The man's navigational experience is re-contextualized by the situation: in thiscase, a "lifesaver" is both a candy and a type of inflatable raft that would be used to save someone stranded at sea. However, because the other island is a mirage, it's not actually possible to reach the "lifesaver" candy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is looking at an island covered in candy and pastry, and comments that he does not see a "lifesaver" among them. A lifesaver is both a candy and a safety device, so the joke is playing on the fact that the man is stranded on a deserted island and is hoping to find a candy that would also help him escape.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of the word "lifesaver": in this context, a lifesaver is both a type of candy, and a real-world safety instrument that helps people in the water. The fact that the stranded men on the tiny island see only candy, and not a real lifesaver, reflects the hopelessness of their situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. A "lifesaver" is both a type of candy and a safety instrument used to help people who are stranded or in danger of drowning. In this case, the stranded men on the island are eyeing the other island which is covered in candy "lifesavers", but those candy lifesavers are not going to help them get off the island; they need an actual lifesaver, like a life raft.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the word "lifesaver" can mean both a candy and a safety device, and in this context, it's clear that the speaker is referring to the candy. The island they are on is small and there is no candy, whereas the other island has an abundance of it. The contrast between the two islands is funny because it's unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lifesaver is a type of candy, but it's also a safety instrument that is used to save people from drowning. The candy island is a tempting target for the two men stuck on their own island, but the fact that the only way to get to it is by swimming makes it dangerous. The joke is clever because it playfully subverts our expectations: we expect the lifesaver to be a safety device, but it's actually something that would put the men in danger if they tried to reach it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words.

The man's friend points out that there is no "lifesaver" on the island --- a lifesaver is both a type of candy and a safety device meant to prevent drowning. The joke highlights the fact that the man is seeing an optical illusion and that the candy-island is not really there.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is stranded on an island full of candy, but he doesn't see a "lifesaver" --- a type of candy that is also a safety floatation device. In other words, even though he is surrounded by candy, he still can't find something that would be immediately useful to him in his current situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "lifesaver" is both a candy and a safety device; in this case, the stranded man is hoping that the other island, which is covered in candy, also has a lifesaver (safety device) so that they can be rescued. However, the other man points out that he does not see a lifesaver, only candy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the stranded men are on a deserted island, and presumably they are hoping for a rescue. However, the only thing on the other island is candy, which is not going to help them in their situation. The joke is clever because a "lifesaver" can refer to both a candy and a safety instrument, so the stranded men are out of luck even if there was a lifesaver on the other island.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is stranded on an island full of candy, but he sees no food. The man is trying to find something to eat, but all he can see is candy. The joke is a play on words because a "lifesaver" can refer to both a candy and a safety instrument.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's statement is literally true: there is no lifesaver (adevice meant to help someone who is drowning) on the island, only candy. However, the man's statement is also figuratively true: the other island, with all its sweets, is a metaphorical "lifesaver" for the stranded men.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="71.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="73.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
