The phrase is commonly used to talk about a person who you were interested in romantically, but things didn't work out, and they ended up getting away. In this case, the man is talking about a fish, which is also known as "the one that got away" when relating to fishing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "the one that got away" can refer to a person who the speaker has been in love with, but who they were never able to be with. In this case, the man is saying it to the Mermaid, who is literally a creature that got away. However, the phrase can also refer to a fish that a fisherman catches and then loses, which is probably what the Mermaid is talking about.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "one that got away" can mean either a fish that a fisherman didn't catch, or a love interest that got away. In this situation, the mermaid is sitting in the man's living room, so it's more likely that the man is thinking about the latter meaning of the phrase. The joke is that, because the mermaid is literally a fish out of water, the man could be thinking about the other meaning of the phrase, which would be ironic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "the one that got away" can refer to a fish that a fisherman didn't catch, or it can refer to a situation where a man didn't pursue a woman he was interested in and regrets it. In this case, the man is sitting in his living room with a mermaid, so it's clear that he pursued her, but the joke is that she is now out of her element (water) and he may regret it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is telling the mermaid that he doesn't want to hear her story about the "one that got away," which could be interpreted as either a lost love or a fish that was too slippery to catch. In either case, it's an amusing play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "the one that got away" can refer to lost love, but in this case, it is referring to a fish. The man is telling the mermaid that he doesn't want to hear her story about the fish that got away, because it is a story that he has heard before.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the phrase "the one that got away". The phrase can refer to a person who you used to love but is now out of your life, or it can refer to a fish that you caught but then let go. In this situation, the mermaid is the one that got away, both in the sense of being a catch (literally, a fish that someone caught) and in the sense of being a lost love.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the phrase "the one that got away" is usually used in the context of a romantic relationship, i.e., the person is talking about a former lover. However, in this case, the phrase takes on a different meaning because the man is talking to a mermaid. In this context, "the one that got away" is referring to a fish that the mermaid didn't catch. The double-meaning of the phrase is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, when a person talks about "the one that got away," they are usually talking about a person they loved but who didn't love them back, or a fish they caught that escaped before they could reel it in. In this situation, the woman is a mermaid, and the man doesn't want to hear her talk about the one that got away, meaning either a fish she caught or a man she loved.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="66.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="68.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
