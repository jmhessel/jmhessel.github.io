<p style="text-align:center;"><img src=https://jmh-public.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/capcon/all_newyorker/all_new_yorker_images_v2/bob_small/contest_94.jpg></img></p><p style="text-align:center;font-size:30px">I guess membership does have its privileges.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the angel carrying the golf bag and grill is implying that there are different levels of heaven, and that the standard membership doesn't include access to barbecue or golf. This is a play on the phrase "family membership," which often indicates that the membership dues are more expensive because more people are included. In this case, the joke is that the "family" is all of humanity, and the premium membership is what allows you access to the heaven's amenities.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Membership" could refer to a membership to a club like a country club, which would usually have amenities like a golf course and a barbecue area. However, in this case, "membership" refers to being a member of heaven, which apparently has the same amenities.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a lighthearted jab at the concept of heaven. The golf and barbecue are typically seen as earthly leisure activities, but in this scene, they are available in heaven as well. This implies that heaven isn't as great as people might think, because it has earthly amenities that are available to everyone, not just VIP members.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it points out the hypocrisy of how some people are able to get into heaven while others are not. The angel is clearly enjoying the "privileges" of being a member of heaven, while the other angels are not. This is a direct jab at how some people believe that they are entitled to heaven because they have led "good" lives.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is play on the saying " membership has its privileges." In this case, being a member of heaven comes with the privilege of being able to bring a barbecue and golf clubs. This is a contrast to the normal understanding of heaven, which wouldn't usually involve such earthly things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because membership in heaven is usually thought of as being free (after all, you've already died) and open to everyone. However, the fact that this angel has "premium" membership implies that there is a cost to get into heaven, and that not everyone is allowed in. The joke is poking fun at the idea of a heaven that is only accessible to a select few.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it portrays heaven as a country club or gated community. In other words, the joke is implying that in order to have certain amenities in heaven (like a barbecue or golf course), you need to be a member of a "premium" version of heaven. This is a play on the phrase "membership has its privileges."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while most people believe that going to heaven is a privilege in and of itself, this angel is pointing out that some memberships are more privileged than others. In this case, the premium membership to heaven allows for things like barbecue and golf, which are two things that people often enjoy in their leisure time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the image shows that, in order to get the full "heaven experience," one needs to have a membership. This echoes real-life memberships, where often times there are different levels or tiers of membership, with the more expensive memberships having more perks/privileges. In this case, the higher-level membership includes being able to bring a barbecue and golf clubs into heaven.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it introduces a unexpected elements - golf and BBQ - to the afterlife. It's unexpected because golf and BBQ are typically seen as relaxation activities that people enjoy in their spare time; they are not typically associated with heaven. The joke suggests that membership in heaven has its benefits, including being able to enjoy these activities.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is poking fun at the idea of a "heavenly membership", which is often thought of as a way to get into heaven by doing good deeds on earth. However, the joke is suggesting that the membership has "privileges" which include things like being able to bring a barbecue and golf clubs into heaven.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. In heaven, there is a "premium" membership that allows for the use of the barbecue and golf; this is a play on the common phrase "membership has its privileges."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's poking fun at the idea of a "heavenly membership." In this case, the premium membership includes activities that are stereotypically enjoyed by rich people on Earth: golf and barbecue. The joke is also clever because it's true that membership to most places does come with certain privileges (e.g., access to a golf course or barbecue area).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of having a barbecue and playing golf in heaven. One might expect that such activities would be reserved for earthly life, since they are considered to be pleasurable activities. However, the fact that the angels have access to these things in heaven suggests that membership to heaven might have some "premium" perks that are not available to everyone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the saying "membership has its privileges." The privileges in this case are usually things like free shipping or early access to sales. However, in this situation, the privileges are things that are associated with earthly pleasures, like grilling and playing golf. Thus, the joke is funny because it's a play on the saying, using privileges that are incongruous with the typical depiction of heaven.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="66.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="68.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
