In this case, the person has put God on hold, which has caused an earthquake. This is funny because it's a play on the idea of God being all-powerful and all-knowing; if anyone could handle a phone call and not need to put the caller on hold, it would be God. But even God can't handle everything, as the joke suggests.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it suggests that the man's current predicament is the result of putting God on hold. This is humorous because it is a play on the idea of an omnipotent being: if God is all-powerful, then how could the man possibly have put Him on hold? By suggesting that the man did just that, the joke creates a sense of incongruity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "let me put you on hold," which is something you say when you need to take care of something else but want to keep the person you're talking to on the phone. In this case, the person is holding on the line with God, and by putting God on hold, the speaker is causing all sorts of chaos as furniture and papers fly around the office.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the saying "let me put you on hold." In this case, the person has put God on hold, which has caused the earthquake. The joke is clever because it's a way of saying that the person has taken on more than he can handle by putting God on hold.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "I'll call you back" is used when you can't talk because you're in the middle of something, but in this case, the speaker is literally in the middle of the room and can't move. The joke is that the speaker put God on hold, and as a result, the earthquake happened. The speaker implies that it's not their fault, but God's for making them wait.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is telling someone on the phone that he will call them back, implying that he is in the middle of something important. However, the fact that he is literally holding on to the desk and papers in the air, and that he has left God "holding" on the other line, implies that the something important he is in the middle of is trying to prevent himself from being killed in an earthquake. The contrast between the mundane phone conversation and the life-or-death situation is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is in the middle of an earthquake, which is a chaotic and dangerous situation. However, he is more concerned with continuing his phone call than he is with the earthquake, and so he tells the other person on the line that he will call them back after he is done talking to God. This is ironic because it is usually people who believe in God who are considered to be more calm and collected in the face of chaos.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it suggests that the reason the man and office materials are suspended in the air is because he put God on hold. This is absurd because it's impossible to put God on hold, and yet, that is the only explanation given for the chaotic scene.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because when you put someone on hold, it's usually considered rude. But in this case, the person has put God on hold, which is even more rude and shows a lack of respect. Additionally, the joke is funny because it's a play on words: the man has "left God holding" on the other line, which both means that he's left God waiting on the other line and that God is the one holding up the furniture andMan in his office.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is so nonchalant about the situation. He's just talking on the phone as if everything is normal, despite the fact that he's literally floating in the air, and his furniture and papers are floating around him. The joke is that he's talking to someone else about how he has to put them on hold because he's talking to God, as if it's no big deal. The incongruity between the casualness of the conversation and the surreal situation is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the irony: the speaker is in the middle of an earthquake, which is a chaotic and dangerous situation, and yet he is still trying to be polite by putting God on hold. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the speaker is literally "holding on" to his desk to stop himself from floating away, but he is also figuratively "holding on" to his faith by continuing to believe in God even in the midst of chaos.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "let me call you back" is something you say when you can't talk because you're on the phone with someone else. In this case, the person the man is talking to wants him to put God on hold, which is a blasphemous and sacrilegious thing to do. The joke is funny because it's a play on words and because it's surprising that the person would ask him to do something so inappropriate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it references the Biblical story of Jonah: in that story, Jonah is swallowed by a whale and spends three days in its belly before being vomited out onto the shore. Similarly, the man in this scene was apparently swallowed by a giant creature (God) and is now suspended in the middle of its belly. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the man is literally "on hold" and the situation is causing chaos.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is in the middle of an earthquake, which is a natural disaster, and he is attributing it to God. This is humorous because it is a common trope to attribute unusual events to God, but in this case, the event is so unusual (an earthquake in an office) that it's more likely attributable to a natural disaster than to God.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is literally "on hold" because he's suspended in midair, but he's also figuratively on hold because he's waiting for someone to answer the phone. The joke is that he's waiting for God to answer the phone, and putting God on hold has caused the chaos in the room --- the earthquake.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="110.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="112.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
