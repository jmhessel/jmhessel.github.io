This is a reference to the decline of the American auto industry in the city of Detroit. The use of "by golly" is also a callback to an old-fashioned way of speaking, which adds to the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the decline of the American auto industry, which was centered in the city of Detroit. The city has been in decline for many years, and the auto industry was a major reason for that decline. The joke is that the workers in the factory are putting icing on the cars as a last ditch effort to make them more appealing, and that this is a sign that Detroit is finally making a comeback.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The city of Detroit is known for its auto industry, which has been struggling in recent years. The joke is that, in a last ditch effort to save the industry, the workers have started putting icing on the cars, as if they were cakes. This is silly because it's not a practical solution and it's not clear how it would help the industry.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the final step in the assembly line is putting icing on the cars. This is presumably a last ditch effort to make the cars more appealing and thus sell more of them. However, it's a silly idea because cars don't have icing on them, and so it's not clear why this would make them more appealing. Nonetheless, the joke implies that this is a sign that Detroit is "back" on top, because they are coming up with creative new ways to sell cars.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The assembly line is putting icing on the cars, which makes them look like cakes. The joke is that the city of Detroit, which is known for its auto industry, is struggling, and this is a last ditch effort to save the industry by making cars that look like cakes.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The machine at the end of the assembly line is putting icing on the cars, which makes them look like cakes. The joke is that the workers in the Detroit car factory are so desperate that they are now making cars that look like cakes, in the hopes that this will be a new trend and help revive the struggling Detroit auto industry.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the troubles that the Detroit auto industry has faced in recent years. The financial crisis of 2008 hit the auto industry hard, and many car factories closed down. The scene in the factory is a play on the idea that the auto industry is struggling to find new ways to make money and stay afloat. The machine that puts icing on the cars is a play on the idea that the industry is putting frosting on a cake (i.e., making something that looks good on the outside but is actually not doing well).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The city of Detroit is known for its car industry, which has been struggling in recent years. The phrase "back in my day" is often used to talk about how things used to be better in the past, which is ironic because the situation depicted is not actually better. In this case, the city of Detroit is "back" because the car factory is now putting icing on the cars, a last ditch effort to make them more appealing, even though it's not clear why anyone would want a car with icing on it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The machine that puts icing on the cars is a "last ditch effort" to save the Detroit auto industry, which is struggling. The joke is clever because "last ditch" can mean both "desperate" and "the very end," and in this case, it's literally the last step in the assembly line.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The city of Detroit is known for its car industry, which has been struggling in recent years. The car factory in the scene is putting icing on the cars, which is a play on the term "icing the cake." The joke is that the factory is so desperate to save the Detroit car industry that they are putting icing on the cars as a last ditch effort. This is ironic because, while icing the cake is usually a good thing, in this case, it is a sign of desperation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The city of Detroit is known for its auto industry, which has been in decline in recent years. The addition of icing to the cars is a last ditch effort to try to make the cars more appealing, and thus save the industry. The joke is clever because it sounds like the speaker is saying " Detroit is back," meaning that the city is making a comeback, when they are really saying that the addition of icing is aback, or strange.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words.

The city of Detroit is known for its auto industry, which has been in decline in recent years. However, the machine that puts icing on the cars is a new development that could potentially save the city's auto industry. So, the joke is that, by adding icing to the cars, "by golly, Detroit is back!" (i.e., the city is saved).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the workers are putting icing on the cars, which is an unexpected and non-standard thing to do in a car factory. This weird icing step might be a last-ditch effort to make the cars more appealing, and thus save the Detroit auto industry. The joke is a play on the idea that Detroit is struggling to keep its car industry afloat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "By golly" suggests that the speaker is surprised, and the phrase "back in my day" often follows "by golly." The joke combines these two phrases to say that cities like Detroit (known for their car manufacturing) are making a comeback. The car factory putting icing on the cars is a possible nod to the fact that Detroit is trying to make its car industry more appealing (and thus, sweeter).</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="106.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="108.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
