The statue is so big that it doesn't even look like it would fit in a standard grave, let alone be affordable for a single family.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's headstone is so big that it looks like it came from Costco, a store known for selling items in bulk. This is a play on words, as the man's head is literally the size of a Costco-bought item.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the grave is so big that it looks like it could have come from Costco, which is a store that sells items in bulk. The fact that it's a grave, and not just a bulk-purchased item, makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Costco is known for selling items in bulk at a discounted price. The headstone in the background is much larger than a normal headstone, implying that it would be more expensive. The couple must have bought it from Costco, hence the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the statue is so big that it looks like it could be purchased in bulk from a store like Costco. However, the fact that it's in a graveyard implies that it's not actually for sale, which makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the statute is so large that it must have come from Costco, which is known for selling large items in bulk. The couple is staring at it because they are presumably wondering how it got there.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the statue's head is so large that it could be mistaken for being a headstone sold in bulk at Costco. The joke is a play on words because "costco" can refer both to the store and to a pile of skulls, which are often found in graveyards.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the headstone is a much larger size than what is typical. The husband is asking where they got it, and the wife casually says "Costco" as if it's no big deal --- in contrast to the big deal that the headstone actually is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The couple is staring at the huge headstone and the woman says that it looks like it came from Costco. This is a play on words because Costco is a store that sells items in bulk, and the headstone is a huge stone that would typically be bought in bulk.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the head statue is so large that it looks like it could have come from Costco, which sells items in bulk at a discounted price. The fact that it's in a graveyard is also funny because it's an unexpected place to find a Costco head statue.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the statue's head is so big that it is reminiscent of a bulk item that would be sold at Costco. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words: the headstone is for a death, while the Costco is a store known for selling merchandise in bulk.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the fact that Costco is known for selling items in bulk. In this case, the joke is suggesting that the person buried in the grave is so large because they bought their coffin in bulk from Costco.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman in the picture is looking at the large headstone and her companion makes a joke that the headstone must have come from Costco. This is funny because Costco is known for selling items in bulk and so the joke is that the headstone is so big because it was purchased in bulk from Costco.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the huge head statue in the graveyard looks like it came from Costco, a store that sells items in bulk. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the statue is a "head"stone, which is a type of grave marker, but it's also a huge head, which is something you would find at Costco.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the statue's head is so large that it looks like it came from Costco, which is known for selling items in bulk. The contrast between the traditional graveyard setting and the large, out-of-place statue is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="106.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="108.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
