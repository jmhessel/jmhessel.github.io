The phrase "watch out for one with a saw" can mean either to be careful of the person who is carrying a saw, or to be careful of the shark that has a saw for a fin. In either case, the implication is that someone is in danger of being hurt.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "watch out for the one with a mouth full of teeth." In this case, the sharks have saws, which they are using to cut through the ice so they can eat the men. This is a clever play on the phrase because it is unexpected and thus, funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected. The sharks are surrounded the men, but rather than attacking, they are sawing through the ice. This is a play on the stereotype that sharks are waiting to attack people, but in this case, the sharks are actually more interested in ice fishing than attacking the men.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words: "saw" can mean both the tool and the act of cutting. So, the joke is warning the ice fisherpeople to watch out for sharks that might cut through the ice to make them fall in, as that has happened before.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that sharks are dangerous predators that will eat anything that moves. In this case, the sharks are sawing through the ice in an attempt to make the men fall into the water, where they would presumably be eaten. However, the fact that this has happened multiple times before implies that the men are well-aware of the sharks' antics and are prepared for them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "saw" can mean two different things: a type of tool used to cut wood, or the word for the past tense of the verb "to see." In this case, the joke is using the latter meaning, as in, "I saw six sharks surrounding the men as they ice fished." The punchline, then, is a warning to the men that they should watch out for a shark that has a saw (the tool), which would be used to cut through the ice and make them fall in.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the movie "Jaws", which is about a shark that terrorizes a town. In the movie, the shark is often seen sawing through things (boats, people, etc.) in order to kill them. In this case, the joke is that the people should be careful of the sharks because they might try to saw through the ice in order to get to the people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it references a classic movie trope in which a character is in danger of being pulled into the water by a Shark, e.g., the movie Jaws. In this case, the joke is made more absurd by the fact that the sharks are sawing through the ice, rather than swimming under it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it references a common trope in horror movies, where the shark (or other dangerous animal) is waiting under the ice to attack unsuspecting people who are ice fishing. In this case, the joke is even funnier because not only is there a shark under the ice, but there are multiple sharks, and they are apparently working together to saw through the ice so they can eat the people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the word "saw." The Sharks are sawing through the ice in an attempt to make the fishermen fall in, which is something that has happened before (according to the joke).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. Sharks are often associated with saws because they have rows of sharp teeth, but in this case, the sharks are actually using actual saws to cut through the ice. This is dangerous for the people ice fishing because they could fall into the water and be eaten by the sharks.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that sharks are often associated with being dangerous. The joke suggests that the sharks are sawing through the ice in order to make the fishermen fall in, and that this has happened before (hence the warning to "watch out").</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common phrase "beware of sharks" -- in this case, the sharks are not just a danger because they are predators, but also because they are sawing through the ice, making it more likely that the fishermen will fall in. This added danger is unexpected and thus funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that sharks are often portrayed as being dangerous and vicious predators. However, in this situation, the sharks are not attacking the men, but are instead sawing through the ice in an attempt to make them fall in. This is a play on the fact that sharks are often portrayed as being dangerous and vicious predators.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is warning the other to watch out for the sharks, but instead of saying "sharks," he says "one with a saw." This is because the sharks have been sawing through the ice to create holes and make the people fall in. The man's warning is thus both literal and metaphorical.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="84.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="86.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
