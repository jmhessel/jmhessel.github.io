However, the couple in this scene is so nonchalant about the train running through their living room that it's clear that this is a regular occurrence for them: the man is even reading a newspaper while the train goes by! Therefore, the most likely explanation for the train running through their living room is not that someone committed suicide, but rather, that it's just a normal part of their day.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. If someone was to see train tracks running through a living room, they might assume that someone had committed suicide by being hit by a train. However, the joke suggests that a more likely explanation is that the train tracks are just going through the house, and the person on the tracks is just using them as a shortcut to the bathroom. This is a more believable explanation because it's less far-fetched than someone committing suicide in such a strange way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The coroner ruled it a suicide, which suggests that someone killed themselves by jumping in front of the train. However, the joke suggests that it's more likely that the person was just going to the bathroom, and the train tracks just happen to go through the house. The joke is clever because it's a play on the common phrase "on the tracks" which is often used to describe someone who is about to die.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the coroner's ruling of suicide seems like a more far-fetched explanation than the more likely explanation that the man was just going to the bathroom. However, given the bizarre context of the train tracks running through the house, the suicide explanation might actually be more likely.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the coroner has ruled the death of the person in the house a suicide, when in reality it's more likely that he was just going to the bathroom (i.e., he wasn't actually trying to kill himself). This is because the train tracks go right through the house, so it's more likely that he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, rather than deliberately trying to kill himself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the coroner ruling the death a suicide seems like a reasonable explanation given the situation, but the speaker points out that it's more likely that the man was just going to the bathroom and the tracks just happen to go through the house. This alternate explanation is more absurd, but it's also more likely, given the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the observation by one of the women undercuts the assumption made by the other woman, that the Bob committed suicide by laying down on the train tracks. Instead, the more likely explanation is that the train tracks go through the house, which is why Bob was lying on them, and he wasn't trying to kill himself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two women are discussing a death that was caused by a train running through the house. The coroner ruled it a suicide, but the speaker didn't believe that. The more likely explanation, then, is that the man was just on his way to the bathroom --- an innocent explanation for why he would be near the train tracks.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "coroner" in this situation is the person who determines the cause of death, and the "ruled it a suicide" means that they have determined that the person died by suicide. In this situation, the coroner has ruled that the person died by suicide because they were hit by a train, but the speaker of the joke suggests that this is not the case, and that the person was just going to the bathroom (a much more banal explanation for why there would be a train in the living room). The joke is clever because it's a play on the fact that "coroner" and "corner" sound the same.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, on the surface, it appears that someone has committed suicide by laying down on the train tracks in the living room. However, the speaker says that she thinks the person was just trying to get to the bathroom --- a much more mundane explanation for why there would be a train track running through the living room. This joke plays on the idea that people often over-interpret things and jump to conclusions without all the facts.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the coroner ruled the death a suicide, which would be a very odd way to kill oneself, rather than the more likely explanation that the person was just going to the bathroom and the train tracks ran through the house. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the word "suicide" can mean both a person who kills themselves and a military mission that is hopeless and doomed to fail. In this case, the "suicide" is the latter: the hapless person was just in the wrong place at the wrong time and got hit by a train.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The coroner ruled the death a suicide, which suggests that the person killed themselves by jumping or lying on the train tracks on purpose. However, the speaker suggests that this is not the case, and instead, the person was just going to the bathroom and the tracks ran through the house, which is a more likely explanation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because although it's true that people do commit suicide by trains, it's much more likely that there's a simple explanation for why there are train tracks running through this living room. The joke is that the person on the sofa indicates that the coroner ruled the death a suicide, when in fact, it's much more likely that the man who died was just on his way to the bathroom and the tracks were there for some other reason.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, given the context of a train running through a living room, it's more likely that the people in the room were killed by the train rather than by suicide. However, the speaker says that the coroner ruled it a suicide, which is less likely given the circumstances. This ironic contrast is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two women are talking about how Bob, one of their friends, died. The coroner ruled it a suicide, but the speaker isn't convinced. The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that people who live near train tracks are more likely to commit suicide by jumping in front of a train. However, in this case, the train tracks are running through the house, which is a much more likely explanation for Bob's death than suicide.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="45.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="47.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
