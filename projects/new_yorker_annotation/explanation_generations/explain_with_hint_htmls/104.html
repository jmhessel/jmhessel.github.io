Dr. Smith, the human in the room, is presumably the scientist who conducted the trial. The joke pokes fun at the idea that clinical trials are often done on untested, potentially dangerous drugs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the film "The Fly", in which a man's DNA is merged with a fly's during an experiment, and he gradually turns into a monstrous fly creature. In this situation, the aliens are the result of a clinical trial gone wrong, and the man in the suit is the doctor who oversaw the trial. The difference in appearances between the aliens and the doctor makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at the pharmaceutical industry and the high cost of experimental drugs. The aliens in the room are the result of a clinical trial gone wrong, likely because the drug was too expensive for the company to properly test. The joke is a play on the phrase "the proof is in the pudding," meaning that the quality of something can be determined by its results. In this case, the aliens are the pudding, and they are proof that the clinical trial failed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the notion that clinical trials are often used to test new, experimental medications. The joke suggests that the aliens in the boardroom are the results of a clinical trial gone wrong, thus explaining why they are monsters.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the character Dr. Smith from the TV show "Lost in Space", who was an evil scientist who often caused trouble for the Robinson family. In this case, the joke is that the clinical trial, which was presumably conducted by Dr. Smith, turned the participants into monsters. The joke is made even funnier by the fact that the aliens are drooling, which implies they are going to eat the man in the suit.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, often in movies and TV, when someone is turned into a monster or otherwise mutated against their will, the person who did it is brought in to give an explanation. In this case, the "experiment" was presumably a clinical trial of some sort of medicine, which turned the aliens into monsters. The suit-wearing man, who is presumably Dr. Smith, is thus the one who has to explain what went wrong.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idea of "clinical trials gone wrong", where an experimental medicine can have unforeseen and dangerous side effects. In this case, the medicine has turned the aliens into monsters, who are now planning to eat the man who is over-dressed for the meeting. The situation is made funnier by theCallback to the B-movie trope of a man in a suit being the only human in a room full of monsters.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity between the friendly doctor introducing himself to the "clinical trial" subjects, who are now monsters as a result of the experiment gone wrong. The clinical trial subjects are aliens, which makes the joke even funnier, as it's unexpected that aliens would be used in a clinical trial in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the clinical trial refers to a scientific experiment testing a new medication, which presumably went wrong and turned the test subjects into monsters. The joke is clever because it plays on the fact that "Dr. Smith" is a common name for a fictional scientist who is always getting into trouble with his experiments.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common trope of aliens being used in scientific experimentation, often for medical purposes. In this case, instead of the aliens being the guinea pigs, they are the scientists, and the human is the test subject. The joke is made funnier by the fact that the aliens are all monsters, which implies that the experiment did not go well.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "human experiment." In this case, the aliens were used as test subjects for an unknown experiment, which went wrong and turned them into monsters. The man in the suit is Dr. Smith, who is responsible for the clinical trial, and he is explaining what went wrong. The aliens are probably drooling because they are hungry, and the man is likely to be their next meal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "What went wrong?" can be interpreted two ways: either something went wrong with the experiment and they turned into monsters, or something went wrong with the experiment and it failed to produce the desired results. In either case, the human in the room, Dr. Smith, is the one who will have to explain the situation to the monsters.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the situation: aliens exist in fiction, but not in reality, so it's impossible to have a clinical trial with them; also, humans typically don't meet with or become food for aliens. The joke is a play on the common trope in science fiction of humans conducting experiments on aliens, often with disastrous results. In this case, the experiment has turned the aliens into monsters, which is why they are drooling and presumably planning to eat the man in the suit.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the film "Alien", in which a group of people are attacked by an alien creature. In this scene, the aliens are the people who were turned into monsters, and the man in the suit is the doctor who is going to explain what went wrong with the clinical trial that turned them into monsters.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the aliens look like monsters, which implies that they were once human beings. The fact that they are in a boardroom implies that they are there to discuss what went wrong in a clinical trial that turned them into monsters. This is a play on the common trope of human beings being turned into monsters by experimental medicine.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="103.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="105.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
