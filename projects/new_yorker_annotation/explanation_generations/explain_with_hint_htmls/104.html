In this case, the mice are under pressure to publish their research, but figuratively, the stakes are higher because if they don't publish, they will literally perish. The fact that it is mice dressed up as scientists makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because rodents are known for their short lifespans relative to humans. In the context of academia, "publish or perish" is a saying that means that academics need to constantly publish new research or they will be passed over for tenure or promotions. The joke is clever because it twists the saying to be "publish and perish" in order to make a pun on the fact that the academics in question are mice, and therefore have shorter lifespans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's punning on the well-known saying in academia, "publish or perish." The joke is that, for the mice in the experiment, they literally have to "publish and perish" because if they don't publish their findings, they will be killed by the scientists.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In the academic world, the phrase "publish or perish" is often used to describe the pressure on academics to constantly publish new research in order to maintain their jobs. In this case, the mice in the lab are under even more pressure to publish, since they are literal "publish and perish": if they don't publish, they will literally be killed by the scientists.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in the academic world, there is a lot of pressure to "publish or perish". This means that unless you are constantly publishing papers in scholarly journals, you are not likely to get tenure or get promoted. The joke takes this a step further by saying that in the mouse academia, they "publish and perish": meaning, they literally publish their papers and then die, since they have a very short lifespan.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in the academic world, there is a lot of pressure to "publish or perish." This means that academics who don't publish their research are at risk of losing their jobs. The joke is that the mice in the lab are taking this idea too literally and are "publishing and perish," meaning that they are publishing their research and then literally dying.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The common saying in academia is "publish or perish", which means that if you want to be a successful scientist, you need to publish your research. However, in this joke, the mice are "publishing and perishing": they are literally being killed in order to be published. This is a dark joke that is funny because it is a absurd exaggeration of the pressure to publish in academia.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "publish or perish" is a common saying in academia, meaning that in order to have a successful career, you need to continuously publish new papers and research. However, in this lab, the mice are literal academics, and they literally need to publish papers in order to avoid being killed --- if they don't publish, they literally perish.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In academia, there is a saying that "you have to publish or perish." This means that if you want to be successful in academia, you have to constantly publish your research or you will fail. In contrast, the mice in the lab are being literal: they are trying to publish their research, but because they are mice, they literally perish in the process.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In the academic world, the pressure to "publish or perish" is a well-known phenomena: one's academic career depends on publishing papers in peer-reviewed journals. However, in this joke, the mice are literal academics: they are publishing papers and are also literally perishing (dying).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words.

In academia, there is a saying that "publication or perish"; meaning, if you want to be successful, you need to publish your research. However, in this case, the mice are literally publishing their research, and they are also going to perish (because they're mice and they're in a lab).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it takes the well-known saying "publish or perish" --- which is often used to describe the pressure on academics to publish papers in order to further their careers and avoid being fired --- and applies it to the mice in the lab, who are literally in danger of perishing if they don't publish. The joke is clever because it's a play on words, and it's also clever because it's a play on the idea of publishing: instead of papers, the mice are publishing their lives (or rather, their deaths).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the common academic saying "publish or perish." In this case, the joke is implying that the academics in the mouse cage are so competitive that they not only have to publish their work to survive, but they actually have to perish (i.e. die) if they don't publish. The literal interpretation of "publish or perish" is what makes this joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "publish or perish", which is a saying in academia that means that if you don't publish your research, you will likely not get tenure or be able to keep your job. The joke is funny because it's taking the idea to the extreme, and implying that in the world of the mice, they literally have to publish their research or they will perish.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="103.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="105.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
