"To meet my maker" is a phrase which means "to die" --- in other words, to meet the person who made you, in this case, God. However, in this situation, the leaf is about to meet its "raker" instead, which is a person who clears leaves from lawns in the fall. So, while the leaf is about to die (i.e. be removed from the tree and raked up), it's not in the same metaphorical sense as "to meet my maker".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the leaf about to "meet his raker" is about to die and fall off the tree. In other words, he's about to be raked up as part of the leaves that will be collected during autumn. The leaf makes a pun on the phrase "meet my maker," which means to die, and changes it to "meet my raker" to reflect his impending doom.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the leaf is about to die, and it's making a pun on the phrase "meet my maker."

"To meet my maker" is often used to mean "to die" because, in most religions, humans are believed to have been created by a god or gods.

"To meet one's maker" is a phrase meaning to die. In this case, the leaf is talking about meeting the person who will rake up leaves in autumn, as opposed to meeting the person who made them, which would be God. The leaf is resigned to its fate, knowing that once it is raked up, it will be discarded and will no longer exist.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the word play on "meet my maker" which is a saying that means to die.
