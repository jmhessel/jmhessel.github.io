The gnawing sensation is caused by the man's teeth, and it's a very strange situation to be in.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the phone is describing the sensation of someone gnawing on his ankle to a doctor, and the fact that there is someone under the desk doing exactly that is both unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because at first it seems like the man on the phone is talking to a doctor about his mental state, when in reality, he is describing the physical pain he is currently experiencing as the man under the desk is chewing on his ankle. The contrast between the two situations creates the humor in the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the phone is talking to a doctor, and he is describing the sensation he is feeling as his ankle is being gnawed on by the man hiding under the desk. The man on the phone is clearly in pain, yet he continues to describe the sensation in a dispassionate way, as if he is chatting with the doctor about the weather.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man on the phone is talking to a doctor, and he's describing the feeling he has as a "gnawing" sensation. However, the man on the ground is actually a rat who is chewing on the ankle of the man on the phone, so the "gnawing" sensation is literal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the phone is talking to a doctor, and he's describing the sensation he's feeling as his ankle is being chewed on by the other man. The fact that he's describing it as a "gnawing" sensation is humorous because it's likely a very painful experience, but the word "gnawing" is usually used to describe a much more innocuous sensation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man under the desk is hiding from something and chewing on the ankle of the man on the phone. It's implied that the man on the phone is talking to a doctor, which makes the situation even funnier because the man on the phone is seeking professional help while the man under the desk is in immediate need of it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man on the phone is talking to a doctor, and he is describing the sensation he is feeling as his ankle is being chewed on by the man hiding under the desk. The man on the phone is trying to describe the sensation as best he can, but the doctor is having trouble understanding what he is saying.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the phone is having a conversation with a doctor about his gnawing feeling, which the reader assumes is coming from the man hiding under the desk, who is actually chewing on his ankle. The absurdity of the situation is what makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the phone is talking to a doctor about a 'gnawing' sensation he's feeling, and the doctor is entirely unaware of the man's true predicament: that he's being eaten alive by a monster under his desk. The joke would be even funnier if the man on the phone was trying to describe the sensation of being eaten alive, and the doctor was still unaware.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the fact that, when you are on the phone with a doctor, they often ask you to describe your symptoms in detail. In this case, the man on the phone is describing his symptoms (of being chewed on by something under the desk) to the doctor, and the doctor is trying to determine what it is. The fact that the man is being literal (instead of just saying he's scared) is what makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the phone is describing the feeling of being gnawed on by something, possibly a rat, to a doctor, while the man under the desk is experiencing that feeling firsthand. The joke is clever because it puts the listener in the position of the man on the phone, trying to imagine what it would feel like to have their ankle gnawed on.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man under the desk is being eaten alive by a rat, and the man on the phone is trying to describe the sensation to a doctor. The man on the phone is in denial about what is happening, and so he's downplaying it to the doctor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it contrasts the dry, technical language typically used to describe an ailment or injury ("No, it's more of a gnawing sensation") with the horrific reality of the situation: the man on the phone is a doctor, and the man on the ground is being eaten alive by some kind of creature.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the man on the ground is being eaten by something, and the man on the phone is calmly talking to a doctor about it, as if it's a normal thing that happens. This contrast makes the joke funny.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="82.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="84.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
