However, in this case, the grim reaper is coming on to the field as the next pitcher, and the previous pitcher jokes that he hopes the reaper doesn't ask him to sacrifice (i.e., to be killed as a human sacrifice).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "sacrifice" has two meanings: in baseball, it refers to a particular play where a batter intentionally gets out so that a runner on base can advance, but it also refers to the act of killing someone as an offering to a deity. The speaker is joking that he hopes his baseball coach, Skip, doesn't ask him to do the latter, suggesting that he values his life more than winning the game.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between a "sacrifice fly" in baseball, which is when the batter hits a fly ball and the runner on third base scores, and a literal human sacrifice, which is when someone is killed as an offering to a deity. The person making the joke is worried that the coach, "Skip," will ask him to do the latter.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "sacrifice fly" is a play in baseball where the batter hits the ball, and the runner on base scores. However, the Grim Reaper, who is literally associated with death, is also present. So, the joke is that the speaker is hoping that the Grim Reaper doesn't ask him to literally sacrifice himself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it juxtaposes two different meanings of the word "sacrifice." In baseball, a "sacrifice fly" is when a batter hits a fly ball that allows a runner to score from third base. However, the more commonly known meaning of "sacrifice" is giving up something precious, usually a life, for the greater good. The speaker is worried that the baseball coach, Skip, will ask him to do the latter.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the grim reaper is coming in to pitch, and the player making the joke is worried that the reaper will ask him to make a "sacrifice." In baseball, a "sacrifice" is when a player gives up their turn at bat to advance a runner to a base; however, the player making the joke is worried that the reaper will ask him to make a human sacrifice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the juxtaposition of the two meanings of "sacrifice." In baseball, a "sacrifice fly" is a play where the batter hits a fly ball that allows a runner on base to score. However, a "human sacrifice" is when someone is killed in order to appease a deity or for some other mystical purpose. The idea of the grim reaper playing baseball is already funny, but the joke becomes funnier when you realize that the speaker is worried about being literal human sacrifice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the two meanings of the word "sacrifice." In baseball, a "sacrifice fly" is when a player hits the ball deep enough that a teammate can score from base, even though the hitter is out. However, the word "sacrifice" can also mean to kill someone or something as an offering to a deity. In this context, the speaker is joking that they hope the baseball coach (Skip) doesn't ask them to make a human sacrifice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it conflates two different meanings of the word "sacrifice." In baseball, a "sacrifice fly" is when a batter hits a fly ball that allows a runner on base to score. However, "sacrifice" can also refer to the act of killing someone as an offering to a deity. The joke is playing on the double meaning of the word, with the speaker hoping that the reaper, who is technically named "Skip" in baseball lingo, doesn't ask him to score a run by hitting a sacrifice fly, but rather that he will just let him live.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men are worried that the Grim Reaper, also known as Death, will ask one of them to "sacrifice" themselves, i.e., to die, in order to move the game along. However, the Grim Reaper is more likely to ask for a "sacrifice fly," a play in baseball where the batter hits a fly ball and a runner on base scores, than an actual sacrifice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "sacrifice." In baseball, a "sacrifice" is a play where a player intentionally gets out (usually by bunting the ball) so that a runner on base can advance. However, the grim reaper is, of course, a personification of death, and "sacrificing" often refers to giving up one's life. Thus, the joke is funny because the speaker is hoping that the grim reaper won't ask him to literally sacrifice his life.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In baseball, there is a play called a "sacrifice fly" where a batter hits the ball in the air and another player scores. However, the grim reaper coming onto the field could be interpreted as a "sacrifice," as in, a human sacrifice. The player is saying that he hopes the coach doesn't ask him to do this, because it would be literally deadly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The speaker isDeath, who is on a baseball field, and is hoping that the player known as "Skip" doesn't ask him to make a "sacrifice," which in baseball terms is when a batter hits a fly ball that allows a runner to score from third base. Given that Death is present on the baseball field, the joke resides in the fact that a "sacrifice" is also a term for a human sacrifice, which is the last thing the speaker wants.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The term "sacrifice" can mean two things: in baseball, a "sacrifice" is a play where the batter gets out but the runner on base scores; in human sacrifice, "sacrifice" means to kill someone as an offering to a deity. The grim reaper is coming onto the field as the next pitcher, and the player who made the joke is hoping that the reaper doesn't ask him to do a human sacrifice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The speaker is worried that the person who asked him to play catch (Skip) will ask him to do a "sacrifice fly," a play in baseball where the batter hits a fly ball to advance a runner, and thereby "sacrifices" their own chance at getting a hit. However, the speaker is also worried that Skip will ask him to do a human sacrifice, which is a much more serious and dangerous request.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="46.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="48.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
