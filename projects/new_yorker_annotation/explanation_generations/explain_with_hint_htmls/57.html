The matador says "olé" to the bull, which is a traditional Spanish cry during bullfighting. However, in this context, it could also be read as the matador flirting with the bull, saying "you had me at olé," meaning "you had me at hello." This creates a funny contrast because it's an unlikely couple: a bull and a matador.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because bullfighters usually say "olé!" when they are victorious in fighting the bull. In this case, the bullfighter has been defeated by the bull, who is now his partner in a dance. The joke creates an unlikely couple out of the bull and the bullfighter.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in bullfighting, the matador is supposed to kill the bull, not dance with it. However, the matador in this instance appears to have won the bull over with their charm, to the point where they are now dancing together. The joke is made funnier by the fact that the matador uses the Spanish word "olé" --- typically used in bullfighting as a way to taunt the bull --- as a way to flirt with the bull instead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The matador says "olé" to the bull, which is a traditional cry during bullfights, right before killing the animal. However, in this case, the matador and the bull are dancing together instead of fighting. This is a humorous reversal of the traditional bullfighter/bull dynamic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected that the matador and the bull would be dancing together. This is because in bullfighting, the matador is supposed to kill the bull, not dance with it. The matador saying "you had me at olé" is a play on the phrase "you had me at hello," which is often used to describe falling in love at first sight. In this case, the matador is saying that he fell in love with the bull at the moment they started dancing together.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The bullfighter says "olé" which is a traditional cry during bullfights, but it can also mean "I surrender" or "you have me." In this context, the bullfighter is saying that he surrenders to the bull, and the two of them have creates an unlikely couple.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The bullfighter's line, "You had me at olé," is a pun on the phrase, "You had me at hello," which is often used to describe the moment when someone falls in love. In this case, the bullfighter has fallen in love with the bull, which is an unlikely coupling.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the word "olé" is typically associated with bullfighting, and it's odd to see the bullfighter say it to the bull while they are dancing. The joke could also be interpreted to mean that the bullfighter was won over by the bull's dancing, creating an unlikely couple.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "ole" is a traditional word used in bullfighting, and it's usually used right before the matador kills the bull. Here, the matador is using it to create an unlikely couple with the bull, which is the opposite of what is supposed to happen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the matador is singing a line from a popular song, "You had me at hello," but he's changed the word "hello" to "olé." This change is appropriate because he's Spanish and in Spain, bullfighting is popular. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words; the matador is saying that the bull had him at "olé," which is a word used in bullfighting. But, it's also a homophone for the word "ally," which means they are on the same side. So, the matador is saying that the bull is now his ally, which is ironic because in bullfighting, the matador is trying to kill the bull.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bullfighter is using a line from a movie, Jerry Maguire, to create an unlikely couple with the bull. The fact that they are both in the middle of a bullfighting arena also adds to the absurdity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "You had me at olé" is a line from a famous movie, Jerry Maguire. However, in this context, it is completely out of place because the matador is not romantically interested in the bull. The bullfighter is just saying olé as a way to start the dance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is unexpected for a matador and a bull to be dancing together. In bullfighting, the matador is supposed to kill the bull, not dance with it. The fact that the matador says "olé" as they are dancing together suggests that he is enjoying the dance, which is not what one would expect.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is unexpected for a matador and bull to be dancing together. The bull is usually seen as the enemy of the matador, so for them to be dancing together is strange. Furthermore, the fact that the matador says "You had me at olé" is also unexpected and humorous because it's a line from a famous movie, Jerry Maguire, but it's out of place in this scene.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in bullfighting, the matador yells "olé" to taunt the bull and show off their mastery over the animal. However, in this case, the matador and bull are dancing together, which implies that the bull is not scared of the matador and might even be enjoying the dance. The matador's "olé" in this context takes on a whole new meaning, since they are now on equal footing (literally and figuratively) with the bull.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="56.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="58.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
