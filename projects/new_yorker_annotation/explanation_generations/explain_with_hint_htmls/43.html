In this case, the beaver has cut the tree down to the middle, but the tree is still standing, which goes against our expectations. The beaver's response is also humorous because it plays on the fact that if he told us how he did the trick, it wouldn't be magic anymore.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the beaver has cut down a tree and somehow managed to make it levitate in the air. When the other beaver asks how he did it, the first beaver says that if he told him, it wouldn't be magic anymore. This response is humorously evasive because, of course, the beaver can't explain how he did it because it's impossible; the joke is funny because the beaver is trying to act like he has done something which is clearly impossible.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In the context of the scene, the beaver Cut a tree in the air, which is impressive enough on its own. But, the beaver's response to the other beaver's question implies that he used magic to make the tree levitate, which is even more impressive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The beaver is saying that if he told the other beaver how he did his "magic trick" of levitating the tree, then it wouldn't be magic anymore. This is a pun on the saying, "If I told you, I'd have to kill you," which is often said in jest when someone doesn't want to share a secret. In this case, the beaver is saying that the secret to his magic trick is so great, that he literally couldn't tell the other beaver without killing him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the beaver is doing a "magic trick" of sorts: he's cut the tree down to the middle, but it's still not falling. This is an impressive feat, and the beaver is playing coy about how he did it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because beavers are not typically known for their magical abilities. In this case, the beaver has done a seemingly impossible feat, cutting down a tree without it falling, and is refusing to explain how he did it because it would ruin the magic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully pokes at the idea of magic versus science. In this case, the beaver has performed a "magic trick" by completely cutting through the tree but having it remain suspended in the air. When the other beaver asks how he did it, the first beaver says that if he told him, it would spoil the magic. This suggests that there is a science or logical explanation to the feat, but the beaver isn't telling so that the other beaver can remain in awe of the "magic."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because beavers are associated with cutting down trees (they're often used as a mascot for logging companies), so it's surprising to see one levitating a tree. The beaver's response is also funny because it's a non-answer to how the beaver accomplished the feat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the beaver is doing a magic trick: he's levitating the tree. The other beaver is trying to figure out how he did it, but the first beaver won't tell him because then the trick wouldn't be magical anymore.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The beaver is saying that if he told the other beaver how he did the "magic trick" of levitating the tree, then it wouldn't be magic anymore. This is a pun because the word "levitating" can also mean to cut down a tree (as in, to "levitate" a tree).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the beaver is reluctant to share his secret for how he's able to levitate the tree. If he told the other beaver, then it wouldn't be magic anymore. This punchline plays off the reveal of a magic trick --- often, the explanation is much less impressive than the actual feat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the beaver is performing a "magic trick" --- he has cut down a tree, but through some unknown means, he has kept the tree suspended in mid-air. When the other beaver asks how he did it, he responds that if he told him, it would spoil the magic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the beaver is doing a magic trick --- levitating a tree in the air --- and refuses to explain how he did it. This is a play on the common phrase "If I told you, I'd have to kill you," which is often said in jest but is also a real threat in some cases. In this case, the beaver is saying that if he told the other beaver how he did the trick, it wouldn't be magical anymore.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the beaver is implying that he has used magic to make the tree remain suspended in the air, even though it has been completely cut through. If he were to tell the other beaver how he did it, then it would no longer be a magic trick.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The beaver is doing a "magic trick" by levitating the tree, but if he told others how he did it, it wouldn't be considered "magic." This is a clever way of the beaver keeping the "magic" of his trick a secret.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="42.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="44.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
