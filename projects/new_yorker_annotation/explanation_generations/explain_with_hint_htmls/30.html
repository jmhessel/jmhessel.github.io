However, in this case, the executioner is using a boxing glove, which is less cruel (because it is less likely to kill the person) but more unusual.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's playing on the phrase "cruel and unusual punishment." The joke is using irony to point out how the boxing glove, while being less cruel than a blade, is actually more unusual.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is punning on the phrase "cruel and unusual punishment." The normal, expected punishment for using a guillotine is death, but the punishment in this scene is less cruel (because the victim will not have their head chopped off) but more unusual (because they will be hit in the face with a boxing glove).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibits "cruel and unusual punishment." In this case, the punishment (beheading with a boxing glove) is unusual, but not cruel. Thus, the joke is a commentary on how the Amendment is interpreted.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "cruel and unusual punishment" is often used to describe punishments that are considered inhumane or unjust. In this case, the joke is that the punishment is not cruel because it's not deadly, but it is unusual because it's not the typical blade.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the play on words "cruel and unusual": "unusual" is defined as not usual, which a boxing glove in a guillotine certainly is; however, "cruel" usually refers to the added savagery of the act, which is mitigated by the fact that the glove is less deadly than a blade would be.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because pillow is play on the phrase "cruel and unusual punishment". In this execution, the punishment is not only unusual (a boxing glove instead of a blade), but it is less cruel than the standard method.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "cruel and unusual punishment", which is often used to mean that a punishment is inhumane. In this case, the executioner is using a boxing glove, which is less cruel (i.e., less likely to kill) than a blade, but is unusual.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "cruel and unusual punishment". The joke is clever because using a boxing glove is, in fact, less cruel than using a blade to execute someone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the standard for "cruel and unusual punishment" is usually interpreted to mean that the punishment must be physically painful. However, in this case, the executioner is using a boxing glove instead of a blade, which is less physically painful, but also more unusual.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the concept of "cruel and unusual punishment." The executioner has replaced the traditional sharp blade of the guillotine with a boxing glove, which is less cruel because it will kill the person more quickly. However, the glove is still unusual, which is why it's still considered punishment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the executioner is using a boxing glove instead of the traditional sharp blade for the guillotine. The man next to him is not pleased, and comments on how this new method is "less cruel and more unusual." This is a play on the 8th amendment to the United States Constitution, which bars "cruel and unusual punishment." The joke is clever because a boxing glove is, in fact, unusual compared to a blade, but it is less cruel because it will kill the person more quickly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a play on the phrase "cruel and unusual punishment". A boxing glove, while still painful, is less cruel than a blade, which would kill the man. Therefore, the man about to be executed is emphasizing the "unusual" aspect of his punishment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "cruel and unusual punishment". In this case, the punishment (of being decapitated by a guillotine) is certainly cruel, but the fact that a boxing glove is in place of the blade makes it less cruel than it would otherwise be. However, the boxing glove is still quite unusual, hence the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "cruel and unusual punishment." The boxing glove is certainly unusual, but it is not as cruel as a blade, which would be the more traditional method of execution.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="29.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="31.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
