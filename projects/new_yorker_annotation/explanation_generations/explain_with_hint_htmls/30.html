In this case, the speaker liked it better when the voices were actually inside their head, because it was more intimate. But now that the voices are on top of their head, it's less personal and more like the speaker is being talked at.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Voices" can mean both the noise that someone makes when they talk, and also the imaginary thoughts or conversation in one's head. So, the person in the joke is saying that they liked it better when the voices (of the people talking to them) were only in their head, and not also coming from the two giant heads in front of them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The desk on top of the man's head is a literal desk, with a man working on a computer on top of it. This is unusual, but the joke is that the man prefers when the desk and the man were inside his head, which is to say, when the desk and the man were just a figment of his imagination. This is ironic because, while the former situation is unusual, the latter situation is actually more common and socially acceptable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker prefers when the people were only in his head, rather than physically sitting on top of his head. This is because, when the people are only in his head, he can pretend that they're not really there, and he doesn't have to deal with them. But now that they're physically on his head, he has to deal with them constantly, and they're driving him crazy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is saying that he liked it better when the voices were inside his head, rather than on top of his head. This is funny because it's a play on words: the tiny men on their heads are literally voices, but they're also people who are talking to the speaker, giving him advice or instructions. The fact that they're on top of his head implies that he's not listening to them, which is why he says he liked it better when they were inside his head, i.e., when he was listening to them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "voices in my head." The phrase is usually used to describe the experience of hearing voices that aren't actually there, which is a symptom of mental illness. In this case, the person hearing the voices is not mentally ill, but rather, the voices are actually coming from people who are sitting on his head.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "the voices in my head." Having the desk and men on top of his head implies that the speaker can literally hear the thoughts of the workers, which is overwhelming and intrusive. The joke is that he would prefer the voices, or thoughts, to be back inside his head where they can't be as easily heard, because at least then he would have some semblance of privacy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "On top of your head" can mean two things: literally, as in the miniature people are sitting on the man's head; or metaphorically, as in the man is thinking about the miniature people. In either case, the joke is funny because it's unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is saying that he liked it better when the tiny men were inside his head, meaning either that he liked it better when he wasn't wearing the desk or that he liked it better when he wasn't hearing the tiny men's voices. But because the tiny men are literally on top of his head, the man's statement is also true in a literal sense, which makes the joke funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The person is saying that they liked it better when the voices were inside their head, meaning when they were just thoughts. However, the voices are now on top of their heads, meaning that they are real people talking to them. The word play is what makes this joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the saying "the voices in my head," which is often used to describe the sensation of thinking multiple thoughts at once. In this situation, the voices are literally on top of the person's head, instead of just being a metaphor for thoughts, and the person prefers it when the voices were only a metaphor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a man talking to another man who also has a desk on his head with a tiny man working on a computer. The speaker implies that he preferred the voices he heard when they were coming from inside his head, rather than from the tiny man on top of his head. The joke speaks to the idea of feeling overwhelmed or stressed at work, to the point where one feels like they are going crazy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common phrase "The voices in my head." In this case, the voices are actually people on top of the man's head, which is a more literal interpretation of the phrase. The man would prefer the voices to be inside his head, because it's more usual and less intrusive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words.
