The man with the furry tail is saying that he simply wears his pants backward, which would explain why the zipper is in the front.

By wearing his pants backward, the man with the tail can put the zipper in front, which makes it easier to use the toilet and also means that his tail won't get in the way as much.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man with the tail is telling the other man how he deals with the inconvenience of his tail, by wearing his pants backward so that the zipper is in the front. This way, his tail can poke through the hole more easily.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man with the tail is asking the other man how he hides his own tail, and the second man responds with a smart-aleck answer: he simply wears his pants backward so that the zipper is in the front, which would presumably make it easier to hide the tail. Of course, the man with the tail could just wear his pants backward too, but the joke is that the second man's answer is unhelpful.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man with the furry tail is saying that he simply wears his pants backwards, so that the zipper is in the front. This would allow him to better use his tail, as opposed to if the zipper was in the back.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a clever solution to a problem. The man with the tail is saying that he wears his pants backward so that the zipper is in the front, which makes it easier for him to use the toilet. This is a practical solution that the other man probably hadn't considered.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the word "tail." If you wear your pants backward, the zipper would be in the front, and therefore, the "tail" would be in the back, which is where it belongs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the fact that people who have tails usually have them in the back, as that's where they're supposed to be. However, if the person were to wear their pants backwards, the zipper would be in the front, and thus the tail would be able to poke through more easily.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a solution to a common problem: how do you keep your tail from getting in the way when you wear pants? The man's solution is to simply wear his pants backward, so that the opening is in the back and his tail can stick out through it. This is a simple but clever solution that most people probably wouldn't think of.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man with the furry tail is saying that he wears his pants backward, which is why the tail works better. This is a pun on the phrase "that's the tail that wags the dog," meaning that the thing that is minor or inconsequential is actually the thing that is driving the larger issue. In this case, the tail is actually the thing that is driving the man's fashion choice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a clever solution to a problem. The problem is that the man on the right has a tail, and he doesn't want the other man to know. The solution is to wear his pants backward so that the tail is hidden. This is a clever solution because it's simple and it doesn't require any special equipment or clothing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the tail is trying to explain how he covers up his tail when he goes out in public. The most obvious solution would be to simply turn his pants around so that the zipper is in the front, which would make it much easier to cover up his tail.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-solution to the problem. The man with the furry tail is asked how he deals with the fact that his tail gets in the way, and he responds by saying that he simply wears his pants backward. This, of course, does not solve the problem, as the tail would still be in the way, and in fact, it might even make it worse.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the tail is saying that he simply wears his pants backward to make the tail work better. This is humorous because it's a non-solution to the problem, as well as being a rather inconvenient way to accommodate for a tail.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the fact that animals often have their tails in the back, while humans have their tails in the front.
