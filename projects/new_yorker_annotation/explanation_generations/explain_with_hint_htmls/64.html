The Clown car is a car that is designed to fit many clowns inside of it, and the Republican National Convention is a political event where the Republican Party nominates their candidate for President. The joke is saying that the Republican Party are like clowns, because they are many people crammed into one car.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at the Republican party by calling them "clowns". The image of a clown car, which is a car that is designed to fit an improbably large number of people inside of it, is used as a metaphor for the Republican party's tendencies to be out of touch with reality and to be full of hot air.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The clown car is a car that is designed to fit many clowns inside of it, and so, when the mechanic sees all of the clowns inside of the car, he says that they are "on their way to the Republican National Convention." This is funny because it is a play on the fact that the Republican Party is often said to be composed of clowns.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the mechanic is making a political statement. In the United States, the Republican Party is often associated with clowns, due to their circus-like atmosphere and the similarity between "clown" and "clowning around". In this case, the mechanic is saying that the car's engine is missing because the clown is on its way to the Republican National Convention, where there would be many clowns in attendance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in recent years, the Republican party in America has been jokingly referred to as a "clown car" --- a car that is so packed with people that it's a wonder it doesn't collapse under the weight. The image of miniature clowns instead of an engine in the clown's car is a play on this metaphor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the clowns in the car are headed to the Republican National Convention, and the GOP is often referred to as a "circus" or a "clown car." This is because the party is often chaotic and filled with controversy. Thus, it's funny to see clowns actually headed to the RNC.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the mechanic is drawing a comparison between the car's owner --- a clown --- and the Republican Party. The implication is that the Republican Party is also a clown car, i.e., something that is bizarre and not functional.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the scenario pictured is clearly impossible: there is no way that that many people could fit under the hood of a car. The joke is clever because it plays on the negative stereotype of the Republican party as a "clown car": a party that is so full of clowns (i.e. foolish people) that it's a joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in recent years, the Republican party in the United States has been increasingly associated with clowns, due to the circus-like atmosphere of their political circus and the buffoonish behavior of many of their politicians. In this scene, a clown and a mechanic are looking at a clown car, and the joke is that the mechanic assumes that the clown is on his way to the Republican National Convention, because it's a gathering of clowns.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the clown car is a common circus stunt where a small car appears to be packed with more clowns than could possibly fit, given the size of the car. However, in recent years, the Republican party has been commonly referred to as a "clown car" due to the large number of candidates that have run for the party's nomination in presidential elections. Thus, the joke is making a comparison between the circus stunt and the political party.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The Republican National Convention is often referred to as the RNC, and so, when the clown says "on your way to the RNC" it sounds like he's saying "on your way to the circus." This is because the Republican Party is often referred to as a "circus" because of the various controversies and drama that surrounds it. Therefore, the joke is implying that the people in the clown car are going to the Republican National Convention, which is a clown-like event.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a political statement about the Republican party being a bunch of clowns. While it's not an overtly partisan statement, it does rely on the stereotype that the Republican party is made up of a bunch of people who are out of touch with reality.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The Republican Party in the United States is often referred to as the "grand old party" or the "G.O.P.". In this joke, the G.O.P. is replaced with "clown car", which is a car that clowns use in order to fit a large number of people inside of it. This joke implies that the Republican Party is a group of clowns.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The clown car is a common object used in circus clown acts, and it's also a derogatory term for the Republican party. The fact that there are so many clowns in the car (more than would fit if there was an engine) is a metaphor for how the party is currently filled with more people than it can accommodate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The Republican National Convention is often referred to as the "clown car" because so many candidates declare their candidacy for the party's nomination. In this case, the actual clown car is being used to transport actual clowns to the convention, which is a play on the common saying.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="63.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="65.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
