The joke could be extended to be even funnier by having the scientist try to bond with the mice in other ways, like by eating cheese or by chasing them around the cage.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected that the scientist would be trying to gain the trust of the mice by dressing up as one of them. This would be a very unconventional way to carry out a scientific experiment, and it's unlikely that it would actually lead to any useful results.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "first you must gain their trust." In this context, the speaker is saying that, in order to get the mice to cooperate with their experiment, they first need to build a rapport with them and gain their trust. However, the fact that the speaker is wearing a rat costume makes it clear that this "gaining trust" will be done in a very literal way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's absurd that the man has to gain the trust of the mice before he can test them. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the common saying "first you must gain their trust," which is often said in reference to building relationships with people. In this case, the man has to build a relationship with the mice, which is a much lower stakes endeavor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In order to study rats, scientists sometimes have to gain their trust first, by building an emotional bond with them. However, in this scene, the scientist is wearing a rat costume, so it's not clear if he's trying to gain the trust of the rats by dressing like one, or if he's just trying to freak them out.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common saying "first you must gain their trust." Instead of being a general statement, it's a specific instruction for the man in the rat costume, who presumably has to gain the trust of the mice before he can test them. The joke is funnier if you imagine the man in the rat costume trying to bond with the mice, which is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the common research practice of using laboratory animals like rats and mice in scientific experiments. The man in the rat costume is trying to gain the trust of the mice, presumably as part of some experimental protocol. The joke is funny because it's absurd to think that a man in a rat costume would be able to gain the trust of the mice; additionally, the idea of emotionally bonding with laboratory animals is usually not part of the scientific process.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the rat costume is following an absurd protocol for handling the laboratory rats. In order to gain their trust, he must dress up as a rat, which is not only illogical, but also goes against the stereotype of scientists as detached and unemotional.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the rat costume is trying to gain the trust of the mice, which is an unusual and unexpected thing to do. The Protocol, as he calls it, of gaining their trust is also funny because it's an unconventional way of dealing with research animals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the rat costume is trying to gain the trust of the mice in order to do some sort of experiment on them. This is unusual because it's usually the other way around: scientists gain the trust of rats in order to do research on them. The reversal of roles is what makes this joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to a famous quote from the film "The Silence of the Lambs", in which the antagonist, Hannibal Lecter, tells the protagonist, Clarice Starling, that in order to get information from him, she first has to "gain his trust". The joke is humorous because the man in the rat costume is attempting to do the same thing with the mice, albeit in a very different context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the rat costume is trying to follow protocol by gaining the trust of the mice before he starts the experiment, but the fact that he is in a rat costume makes it seem like he is the subject of the experiment, not the mice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the rat costume is trying to follow protocol by gaining the trust of the mice before he starts the experiment. The idea of a man in a rat costume trying to establish trust with actual rats is absurd, and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "first you must gain their trust" is a common one, usually applied to situations in which you are trying to get information from someone. However, in this context, the phrase takes on a new meaning because the scientist is talking about how to get information from the mice: first, he must gain their trust by befriending them. The fact that he is dressed as a rat adds an extra level of irony to the joke.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="33.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="35.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
