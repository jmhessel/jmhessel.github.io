However, the fact that they are aliens also means that the author is literally from another planet, which makes the editor's question even more ridiculous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "planet": in this context, a planet refers to a sphere-shaped celestial body orbiting a star. However, it can also refer to a place where a certain type of person or thing is found. Therefore, the cartoon editor is asking the other alien on what planet (i.e., what place) the other alien could have come up with the idea that the cartoon would be funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the alien cartoon editor is from another planet, and so the alien author is asking him if he thinks the cartoon would be funny on Earth. Given that the editor is from another planet, it's highly unlikely that he would find anything funny that is specific to Earth humor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the aliens is asking the other alien, who probably submitted the cartoon, why he thought it would be funny. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the aliens are from different planets, so the cartoon editor is asking the other alien why he thought the cartoon would be funny "on what planet" (i.e., Earth) it was set.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it's a normal thing for a cartoon editor to reject a cartoon, in this case, the editor is actually from another planet, making the rejection even more scathing. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the editor is asking on what planet (i.e., in what context) the other alien thinks the cartoon would be funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the editor is from another planet, so the alien author's assumption that the editor would find the cartoon funny is incorrect. The editor is, quite literally, from a different planet, and so the alien author's cultural assumptions are not applicable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, on Earth, the cartoon is not considered funny, but the author is from another planet where the humor might be different. The editor is quite literally asking the author which planet they imagine the cartoon would be funny on.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it takes the well-known experience of submitting a cartoon to a editor, and getting rejected, to an extreme. In this case, the editor is actually from another planet, which makes the rejection even more harsh.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the alien cartoon editor is giving a rejection to another alien's cartoon. The rejection is literal, because the alien's cartoon is not from the editor's planet and thus he does not find it funny. However, the rejection is also metaphorical, because the alien's cartoon is not good enough to be published in the New Yorker.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the editor is literally from another planet, i.e., not Earth. Thus, when he says "On what planet do you imagine this would be funny?", he is asking in earnest because he doesn't understand why the other alien thinks the cartoon would be funny to humans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the editor is from another planet, and is thus not familiar with what would be considered funny on Earth. The author of the cartoon is perhaps from Earth and has submitted it to the editor, who is rejecting it because he doesn't think it would be funny to aliens.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the editor's criticism of the other alien's cartoon is based on the fact that the editor is, quite literally, from another planet. This is a play on the idea that people from different cultures can find things funny that other people don't, because they don't share the same context or experiences.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the alien cartoon editor is, quite literally, from another planet. He is judging the cartoon based on the standards of his home planet, which are probably different from the standards of Earth. The joke is clever because it is both a play on words (i.e., the editor is from another planet, so he is judging the cartoon based on different standards) and a pun (i.e., the editor is judging the cartoon as if it were a competition, and the cartoon is not winning).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the editor is from another planet, and the planet he is from probably has a different sense of humor. The author of the cartoon is thus rejected because his sense of humor is not universal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the alien cartoon editor is asking the alien author of the cartoon to think about what planet it would be funny on. The joke is clever because, of course, the answer is "none", since it's not a funny cartoon. However, the question itself is humorous because it's clear that the editor doesn't think the cartoon is funny, but is asking the question in a very pointed way.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="80.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="82.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
