This is silly because, of course, the elephant can't actually understand what the caveperson is saying or thinking; elephants are not known for their intelligence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveperson is probably not very good at painting, given that he or she is living in a cave. The mammoth, on the other hand, has no reason to be good at painting, since he's just a big animal. Yet the caveperson is still worried about what the mammoth is thinking, which likely has to do with his lack of skill.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a self-deprecating joke about the caveman's painting skills. The caveman is likely aware that he's not the best artist, and the mammoth is probably thinking that the caveman should just stick to hunting and gathering instead of trying to paint.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually, when someone is thinking about quitting their job, it's because they are unhappy with their current situation. However, in this case, the caveperson is considering quitting hunting and gathering in order to pursue a career in cave painting full time. The joke is funny because it's a play on the idea that people usually only change jobs when they are unhappy, but in this case, the caveperson is thinking about changing jobs because they are actually quite good at cave painting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while cave paintings are often seen as primitive and rudimentary, they are actually quite skillful and require a lot of precision and talent. Thus, the caveman in the joke is feeling bashful about his skill, but the cave painting is still aHunt and gathering is a skill that is no longer needed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is likely thinking that the elephant is judging him for his cave painting skills. The caveman is nervous that the elephant will think he should stick to hunting and gathering because that is what cavemen are known for. The elephant, however, is just standing there being a good friend and model.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is painting the mammoth in a way that makes it clear he's not happy with his work. The caveman is worried that the mammoth will judge him harshly for his painting skills, and is telling him not to quit his day job of hunting and gathering.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveperson is likely not a very good painter, given that they are just drawing on a cave wall with sticks. The elephant, as the subject of the painting, is probably wondering why the caveperson chose to stop hunting and gathering in order to paint such a crude picture.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The caveperson is telling the mammoth that he knows what he's thinking - he's thinking that the caveperson should continue to hunt and gather instead of painting. However, the caveperson is actually thinking that the mammoth should continue to watch him paint because he's not very good at it and is bashful about his skill.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveperson is somewhat self-conscious about their painting skills. The viewer might be thinking that the caveperson should stick with hunting and gathering instead of painting, and the caveperson seems to read the viewer's mind, giving a humorous response.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveperson is presumably not a very good painter, given that he's Bashful about his skills. However, the Mammoth is likely to be unimpressed by the caveperson's skill regardless, since he's a Mammoth and not a art critic. The joke is a play on the fact that cavemen are often associated with being primitive and unsophisticated.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because cave paintings are often seen as being crude and amateurish, and so the caveman may be worried that the mammoth will judge his painting skills harshly. However, the joke also points to the fact that cave paintings were an important part of early human culture, and so the caveman shouldn't give up on painting just because he's not a master artist.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because cavemen are often seen as being unsophisticated, and the caveman in the picture is no exception. He's so unsophisticated, in fact, that he's unsure of his own painting ability, and he's worried that the elephant might think he should stick to hunting and gathering instead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is probably not very good at painting, and the mammoth is just a big, hairy, funny-looking animal. The caveman is probably worried that the mammoth will make fun of him for his painting skills, so he is telling the mammoth not to laugh at him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is self-conscious about his painting skills, and is worried that the elephant will judge him. The caveman is also worried that if he stops hunting and gathering, he won't have anything to eat. This is a play on the common worry that people have about trying new things; they fear that they will be bad at it, and that it will cost them their livelihood.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="50.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="52.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
