The joke is made funnier by the fact that the man who was hiding is now stuck in the tree, and can't go anywhere.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the game of hide and seek, usually, after one person hides, the other person seeks, but in this situation, the man who was hiding has to seek, because he is now stuck in the tree. The reversal of the traditional roles is what makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the hide-and-seek game. The man who was hiding in the tree trunk is now telling the other man, who was cutting down the tree, to hide. However, since there is no where else to hide, the man will probably be found quickly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in the game "hide and go seek", after one person hides, the other person has to go and find them. In this case, the person who was hiding is now stuck in the tree, and the other person who was seeking now has to hide. The reversal of roles is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man who was living in the tree stump says "O.K., now it's your turn to hide," which could mean that he wants the other man to play a game of hide and seek with him. However, it could also mean that the man who was living in the tree stump wants the other man to hide so he can take his turn living in the tree stump. Either way, the joke is funny because it's a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the game "hide and seek." In the game, one person hides while the other person tries to find them. In this case, the man in the stump has been found, but instead of being seeked, he is now the hider. The joke is clever because it both makes fun of the man for being found so easily, and also pokes fun at the game itself by inverting the roles.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it seems like the man who was living in the tree stump was playing a game of hide and seek with the lumberjack. The man with the saw is presumably the seeker, and the man in the stump was hiding in the tree. But, now that the tree has been cut down, the man in the stump has nowhere to hide, so he has to come out.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it takes the game of hide and seek, which is often played by children, and puts a dark twist on it. In this version, the man who was hiding in the tree trunk is found, and now, the man with the axe is telling him that it's his turn to hide. This is funny because it's a play on the fact that, in the game of hide and seek, the person who is "it" is the one who is doing the searching, and so, the roles are reversed in this joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common childhood game of "hide and seek". In the game, one person is "it" and has to find the other people who are hiding. However, in this instance, the man who was just hiding in the tree is now "it", and the other man is telling him to go hide again. The joke is funny because it's a reversal of the expected roles in the game.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who was living in the tree stump is now playing a game of hide and seek with the man who cut down the tree. In hide and seek, usually, one person (often a child) hides, and the other person (often an adult) has to find them. But in this case, it's the reverse: the man who was hiding in the tree stump is now the one who has to find the other man.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who was cutting down the tree is now playing a game of hide and seek with the man who was stuck inside of it. This is silly because, in a game of hide and seek, usually, both people are hidden at the same time, and then they both seek each other out. In this case, the man who was hidden is now being asked to hide again, even though he has already been found.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the tree stump is playing a game of hide and seek with the man who just cut him down. The game is usually played with children, not adults, and it's definitely not something you would expect two grown men to be doing in the woods.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the game "hide and seek". In the game, one player hides, and the other player has to find them. In this situation, the man who was hiding has been found, and so now it's his turn to hide. But, since he was just found, it's not likely that he'll be able to hide again very well.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's based on the game "hide and go seek". In that game, one person hides and the other person has to find them; after the first person is found, the roles are reversed and the second person becomes the hider. In this joke, the man who was hiding is found, and the man who was seeking says "now it's your turn to hide", indicating that it's now the other man's turn to be the hider. However, the joke is funny because the second man is impossible to hide, given that he's in a hole in a tree trunk.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the tree stump is playing a game of hide and seek with the lumberjack. But, in this case, the roles are reversed: the man in the stump is hiding, and the lumberjack is supposed to be finding him. The fact that the man in the stump was just found, and is now telling the lumberjack to hide, is funny.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="50.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="52.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
