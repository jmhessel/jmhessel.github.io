The first myth is that the pyramids were built by slaves, which is likely not true. The second myth is that Jewish slaves were used to build the pyramids, which is also likely not true. However, the conflation of the two myths in the joke suggests that the hot dog booth is kosher because the slaves who built the pyramid were Jewish.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is playing on the stereotype that Jewish people built the Egyptian pyramids as slaves. The joke is that of course the hot dogs from the booth would be kosher, because the slaves who built the pyramid were Jewish.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully casts doubt on whether the hot dog is actually kosher or not. The joke hinges on the fact that kosher food is prepared in accordance with Jewish religious law, and therefore, if the hot dog was prepared by someone who is not Jewish, it is unlikely that it would be truly kosher. However, the vendor reassures the woman that the hot dog is kosher by saying that it was made by the same people who built the pyramids – Jewish slaves. This is a humorous way of saying that the hot dog is definitely kosher.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it imagines that the ancient Hebrew slaves who built the pyramids would have also set up a kosher hot dog booth. The anachronism, or out-of-place element, of a hot dog booth being in an ancient Egyptian pyramid, is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. When something is "kosher," it means that it's in line with Jewish dietary law. In this case, the hot dogs being sold at the booth are kosher because they were made by Jews (i.e., the slaves who built the pyramid).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully pokes at the stereotype that Jewish people are good at making money and are cheap. The joke suggests that because Jewish people supposedly built the pyramids, they would be the ones to put a hot dog stand there and that the hot dogs would of course be kosher. The joke is funny because it's a reversal of the stereotype: instead of Jewish people being cheap, they are the ones running a business, and instead of the hot dogs being expensive, they are free.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The Jewish people have a dietary restriction known as kosher, which governs what kinds of food they are allowed to eat. The punchline of the joke is that the hot dogs at the booth are kosher because the people who built the pyramid, the Egyptian slaves, were Jewish.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a play on words. "Kosher" can refer to food that is prepared in accordance with Jewish dietary law, but it can also refer to something that is legitimate or proper. In this case, the hot dog stand is legitimate because it was built by Jewish slaves who were forced to build the pyramid.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "kosher": in this context, it can either mean that the hot dog is prepared in accordance with Jewish dietary law, or, more likely, that the hot dog comes from a vendor who is Jewish (i.e., the vendor is "kosher"). The former meaning is funnier because it's not likely that there would be a kosher hot dog stand at the top of the Egyptian pyramids, given that the pyramids were built by Jewish slaves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of "kosher." In this context, "kosher" means that the hot dog is fit to be eaten by Jewish people according to Jewish dietary law. However, the fact that the man giving the hot dog to the woman is standing outside a pyramid built by ancient Egyptians implies that he is suggesting that the hot dog is made of beef that was kosher according to the Egyptians who built the pyramid.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Kosher" can mean both "proper or legitimate" and "food that conforms to the dietary regulations of Judaism." In this case, the hot dog booth is kosher in the second sense because it's built on top of a pyramid, which was constructed by Jewish slaves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the historical inaccuracy: Jewish slaves did not build the Egyptian pyramids. The joke is playing on the stereotype that Jewish people control the world, and thus would have been responsible for building one of the most iconic structures from ancient times.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="69.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="71.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
