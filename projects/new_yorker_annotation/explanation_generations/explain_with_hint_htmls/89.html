In this case, the man is even hunting in his living room, and yet he's still taking the precaution of wearing bright colors. This joke hinges on the incongruity of the situation: a man hunting in his living room is absurd, but the man's concern for his safety is entirely rational.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's true: hunters often wear bright colors when they go out into the woods to avoid being accidentally shot by another hunter. However, the joke takes this one step further by suggesting that the man is so dedicated to hunting that he even does it in his living room, and therefore, he needs to be even more careful to avoid being accidentally shot.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is wearing hunting gear, which is typically used to help hunters blend in with their surroundings so that they can ambush their prey. In this case, the man is in his living room, so he's not actually hunting anything --- but he's still dressed as if he is. The woman's comment about always dressing in bright colors is a way to contrast the man's hunting gear with what would actually help him avoid being shot: in other words, if he wants to avoid being shot, he should avoid wearing camouflage and should instead dress in bright colors.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to how hunters will dress in brightly-colored clothing so they won't be mistaken for game animals and shot. In this case, the man is dressed in bright colors, but he's still in a situation where he could be shot, suggesting that even if you take precautions, accidents can still happen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the hunter is in a situation where he is more likely to get shot by another hunter than the moose he's hunting. He's in his living room, wearing full hunting gear, and pointing his gun at the moose on TV. The fact that he's wearing bright colors is a reference to the fact that hunters often wear bright colors to avoid being shot by other hunters. In this case, the bright colors aren't protecting him from other hunters, but they are a ironic way of him avoiding being shot by his own gun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common hunter safety rule of wearing bright colors so you don't get shot by accident. In this case, the man is even hunting in his living room, so the bright colors are probably the only thing keeping him safe from shooting himself by accident.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to how hunters will wear bright colors (like orange) so that they can be easily seen by other hunters and avoid being shot accidentally. The man in the joke is wearing camouflage, which is the opposite of bright colors, and is thus more likely to be shot. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words: the man is literally being shot (with a gun), but he is also being shot (with an elk on TV).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that people who dress in hunting gear are often trying to blend in with their surroundings so they can better stalk their prey. In contrast, the person in the bright colors is much less likely to be accidentally shot by a hunter.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because people usually only dress in bright colors as a safety measure when they are out hunting, in order to avoid being accidentally shot by other hunters. In this case, the hunter is in his own living room, so the joke is that he is so into hunting that he takes these precautions even when he is not in danger of being shot by anyone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common advice to hunters about wearing bright colors so they won't be mistaken for game and shot. In this case, the man is actually hunting in his living room, so the advice to dress in bright colors is more relevant than ever.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is saying that the reason she always dresses in bright colors is so that she won't be mistaken for game by hunters. In this particular instance, the hunter is in his own living room, so the odds of him mistaking her for an animal are pretty low. However, given that he is dressed in full hunting gear and is pointing a gun at the television, it's not entirely out of the realm of possibility.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is going to shoot an animal on TV, which is not only not real, but also not even in the same room as him. The joke suggests that the man is so eager to hunt that he will even shoot an animal on TV, which is not only not real, but also not even in the same room as him. By wearing bright colors, the man is making it less likely that he will be shot by another hunter by mistake.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is dressed in hunting attire even though he's in his living room, which is an indoor space. The joke is also funny because the man is wearing bright colors, which is the opposite of what one would expect for a hunting outfit. The joke plays on the idea that people who dress in brightly-colored clothing are more likely to be seen and not get shot (accidentally) by hunters.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that men who hunt are "rednecks" or unintelligent. The woman is saying that the reason she dress in bright colors is to avoid being mistaken for game, or being accidentally shot, by a hunter like the man in the living room. This is a real danger for people who live in areas where there is hunting, so the joke has a hint of truth to it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is hunting a moose, which is a wild and dangerous animal, in his living room. This is made even more dangerous by the fact that he is wearing bright colors, which makes it more likely that he will be mistaken for the moose and shot by the hunter.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="88.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="90.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
