In this case, the astronaut is literally going up, because they are an astronaut, but the bellhop doesn't know that. The joke is a play on words because "going up" can mean going to heaven after you die, but in this case, it just means going to the next floor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the astronaut is wearing a space suit, which is typically associated with going to space (i.e., "going up"). However, they are clearly in an elevator going up in a building, so the joke is that the astronaut is going up in the elevator just like anyone else.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the difference in status between an astronaut and an elevator operator. An astronaut is someone who is trained to go to space, while an elevator operator is someone who just operates elevators. In this case, the astronaut is going up in the elevator, but the elevator operator assumes that the astronaut is going up in terms of their career or social status.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The astronaut is wearing a space suit, which makes the bellhop assume that they are going up, as in to space. However, the astronaut is actually just going up in the elevator.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the astronaut is wearing a space suit, which is designed for space travel outside of a spacecraft. However, the elevator operator assumes that the astronaut is just going up, i.e., to the next floor. The joke is a play on words because "going up" can mean either going to the next floor in a building or going up into space.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in most elevators, the operator asks the passengers what floor they want to go to, and then pushes the corresponding button. In this case, the space-suited person is already going "up", but the bellhop assumes they want to go to another floor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the astronaut is in an elevator, which goes up and down, but the astronaut is wearing a space suit. The implication is that the astronaut is going to space, which is "up," but the bellhop assumes that he is going up to a higher floor in the building.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bellhop is asking the astronaut if he's going up, when in reality, the astronaut is on his way down to earth. This is a play on words because "going up" can mean either going to a higher floor in the building or going back to space.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because according to the common saying, "What goes up must come down", the bellhop assumes that since the astronaut is coming out of the elevator, he must be going up. In reality, the astronaut has just come down from space, so the bellhop's assumption is incorrect.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the astronaut is coming down from space, rather than going up. Thus, the butler's question is irony because it is the opposite of what is actually happening.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in the space suit is clearly not going "up" in the traditional sense, since they are already in an elevator. However, the joke implies that the person in the space suit is going up in the sense of becoming an astronaut, or perhaps in the sense of going to space.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bellhop, a hotel employee whose job is to carry luggage and assist guests, mistakes the astronaut for a guest. The bellhop asks the astronaut if he's going up, meaning to ask if he's going up to his room. However, the astronaut is literally going up --- he's just coming down from space.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bellhop is asking if the astronaut is going up, when in reality, the astronaut is about to exit the elevator going down. The joke is funny because it's a play on words --- "going up" can mean either going up in the elevator, or going up in space. In this case, the bellhop is assuming that the astronaut is going up in the elevator, when in reality, the astronaut is going up in space.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bellhop thinks that the astronaut is going up in the elevator, when in reality, the astronaut is about to get off the elevator. This is funny because, while it's a common question for bellhops to ask, in this context, it doesn't make sense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "going up": in a normal scenario, "going up" would refer to going up in the elevator to the next floor. However, in this context, with an astronaut in a space suit, "going up" could refer to going up into space. The joke is made funnier by the fact that the elevator operator is a bellhop, who is assumed to be very knowledgeable about his hotel guests and their comings and goings.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="32.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="34.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
