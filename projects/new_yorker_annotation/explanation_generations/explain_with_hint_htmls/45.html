This is funny because, while the animal may be trying to be helpful, it's not giving a simple answer to the question.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the suit is known by many names, which is a reference to the various names of God that are used to enumerate the different qualities attributed to the supreme being. However, in this case, the man in the suit is not God, but Satan, which is a humorous reversal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it uses the familiar trope of a person coming into a room and seeing a famous person or deity waiting for them. In this case, the famous person is God, who, as the receptionist says, is known by many names. This is a play on the fact that there are many names for God in different religions, which demonstrates the supreme being's omniscience.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the office worker who is Satan is pretending to be a religious person who is familiar with the various names of God. He's trying to impress God by name-dropping, but God isn't impressed. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the various names of God are enumerations of the various qualities of a supreme being, but Satan is enumerating the various names of God.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in order to get into the room to see God, the animal at the desk says that he is known by many names. This is a reference to the fact that, throughout history, there have been many different names for God, reflecting the different qualities that people have ascribed to the supreme being. In this case, the punchline is that the animal is trying to say that he is known by many names in order to get into the room, but he is not actually known by many names.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the anthropomorphism of God: He is usually depicted as an old white man, but in this case, He is sitting at a desk in a waiting room. The joke is also funny because it references the fact that there are many names for God in various religions, and that some of those names enumerate the various qualities of a supreme being.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully imagines a deity, who is usually thought of as all-knowing, as having to introduce himself to someone who doesn't know who he is. The joke is also clever because it's true that there are many names for God across different cultures and religions, which reinforces the idea that this God is all-knowing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to the fact that there are many names for God in different religions, and that some of those names enumerate the various qualities of a supreme being. In this context, it is humorous because the desk-jockey secretary is applying that notion to Satan, who is not usually considered to be a supreme being.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the absurdity of the situation: an animal is at a reception desk talking to God, who is waiting in the room beyond. The animal says that God is known by many names, which is true, but the joke is that none of those names apply to the animal. Hence, the animal is trying to trick God into thinking it is worthy of entering the room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully questions the idea of a supreme being. In religious texts, God is often described as having many names, which denote different aspects of his personality. However, in this case, the animal is saying that he, too, is known by many names. This pokes fun at the idea that there could be anything that is more supreme than God.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The receptionist is telling the person who is waiting to see God that He says He is known by many names, but the receptionist is also saying that there are many names for God. This is humorous because it implies that there are so many names for God because there are so many different qualities that He possesses, enumerating some of the various attributes of a supreme being.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the receptionist is trying to be polite and professional, but the animal is clearly not human. The animal is likely trying to say that he is God, but the receptionist doesn't understand because he doesn't speak the language.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The person in the suit is named "God," but he is also known by many other names, which are enumerated in the various religious texts. This meant that, when the person in the suit said that he is known by many names, the Devil thought that he was being told the various names of God, when in reality, he was just being told the person's name.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the animal is trying to be humble in the presence of God, and so he says that God probably knows him by many different names. However, the animal is not aware that in many religions, including Christianity, there is only one God, who has only one name. So, the animal's statement is humble but also na√Øve.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that there are many names for God (e.g. Jehovah, Allah, Vishnu, etc.), which are often used to enumerate the various qualities of a supreme being. In this case, the man in the suit is Satan, who is trying to get an appointment with God, and is using one of God's many names in order to get past the secretary.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="44.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="46.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
