In this context, "evolution" is used to mean the process by which changes in heritable characteristics of a population occur over time. However, the word can also be used more colloquially to mean something that is becoming increasingly popular or common. In this case, the joke is clever because the brightly-colored tails of male peacocks have evolved solely for the purpose of mate selection: the more colorful the tail, the more likely a male is to find a mate. However, to humans, the tail may appear gaudy or tacky, which is the punchline of the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because peacock tails evolved to attract mates, but from a human standpoint, the tail is tacky and gaudy. The joke is also funny because it's true - many times, what is attractive to other members of a species is not attractive to humans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The tails of peacocks evolved to be colorful and impressive in order to attract mates; however, to humans, the tails just look tacky and gaudy. Thus, the joke is commenting on how humans often find things that are meant to be attractive to members of the opposite sex to be tacky.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while male peacocks have evolved to have brightly-colored tails in order to attract mates, the females are unimpressed by them for human reasons (i.e., they think they are tacky). This is a play on the fact that, while humans think of peacocks as beautiful, the females don't actually find them attractive for the reasons that we do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a jab at how peacocks evolved their impressively large tails. The tails are used to attract mates, but from a human perspective, they can be seen as gaudy or tacky. Therefore, the joke is poking fun at how something that is seen as beautiful in the animal kingdom can be seen as tacky by humans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the male peacock's tail is a prime example of sexual selection: the males with the most colorful and impressive tails are more likely to mate. However, from a human perspective, the tail is tacky and gaudy, which points to the absurdity of the peacock's tail from an evolutionary standpoint.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the peacock's tail has evolved for the purpose of mate selection (i.e., to attract females), the females in this particular scene are not interested in him for that reason: they are more interested in his tail for its aesthetic value, which humans would find tacky. This shows that, even though the peacock's tail has evolved for a specific purpose, it can still be viewed as tacky by humans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a joke about the peacock's tail, which is a well-known example of an animal feature that has evolved for mate selection. The joke is that, even though the tail has evolved to be attractive to females, the females in the bird enclosure are not impressed by it for human reasons (i.e., they think it's tacky).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's true: male peacocks have evolved to have extremely large, colorful tails in order to attract mates. However, from a human perspective, we can see that the females are not actually impressed by the tails, and find them to be tacky. The joke is playing on the idea that, from an evolutionary perspective, what works doesn't always make sense to us.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that male peacocks have evolved to have such large and colorful tails in order to attract mates. However, the females in the enclosure are not impressed by the peacock's tail for the same reasons that humans would find it tacky or gaudy. This joke highlights the disconnect between what is attractive to humans and what is attractive to animals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the peacock's tail feathers have evolved to be colorful and impressive in order to help him mate with female peafowl, the females are unimpressed for human reasons (i.e., they think it's tacky). Thus, the joke is poking fun at the idea that evolution can produce some things that humans would consider to be aesthetically unpleasing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the peacock's tail, while an impressive display to other peacocks, is actually quite tacky when humans see it. The joke is poking fun at the fact that sometimes, things that evolve for one purpose (like the peacock's tail for mate selection) might not work as well when humans are involved.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The peacock's tail is an example of something that has evolved for the purpose of mate selection: the tail is brightly colored and contains a lot of feathers in order to attract females. However, the joke is saying that the peacock's tail is so bright and showy that it is tacky, which is a human judgment that has nothing to do with the actual function of the tail.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "evolution" can refer to the scientific process by which species change over time to adapt to their environment. However, in this case, it refers to the male peacock's tail, which has evolved to be very large and colorful in order to attract mates. However, from a human perspective, the tail may be seen as gaudy or tacky, rather than attractive. The joke is clever because it points out the discrepancy between what is considered attractive to humans versus what is considered attractive to other animals.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="86.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="88.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
