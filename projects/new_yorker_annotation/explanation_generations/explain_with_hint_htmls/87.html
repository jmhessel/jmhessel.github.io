In this case, the gigantic mouse is dressed as a businessman, representing the corporate world, which is often seen as a "trap" for those who get too caught up in it. The mouse's awareness of the cheese as a trap and his continued consumption of it despite this knowledge is a metaphor for how businesspeople often continued to participate in systems that they know are rigged against them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the mouse is dressed in a suit as if it is a business professional, attending a business meeting. The mouse is probably wondering if it's a trap, because often times, cheese is used as bait to lure mice into traps. The mouse's concern is humorous because it's a common stereotype that mice are attracted to cheese.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The mouse is asking if the cheese on the table is a trap, and he is also asking if the business meeting is a trap. This double meaning is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "is this a trap?" can mean two things: first, it can be a genuine question about whether the meeting is a trap set up by the mouse's enemies, and second, it can be a reference to the fact that the mouse is staring at a huge piece of cheese, which is often used as bait to trap mice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the mouse is dressed as a businessman, which is an unusual sight. Furthermore, the mouse is clearly pondering whether or not the cheese on the table is a trap, which is a clever play on words because cheese is often used as bait on mouse traps.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the mouse is dressed in a suit, implying that it is a business professional like the rest of the people in the room. However, the mouse is also a rodent, which are often considered pests. The joke plays on the stereotype that mice are attracted to cheese, which is often used as bait on mouse traps. In this case, the mouse is being asked if it's a trap, i.e., if the meeting is a trap to get the mouse to agree to something.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "trap": a trap can refer to a hidden danger or a way to catch mice. In this case, the mouse is aware of the danger that the cheese might pose (as bait for a mouse trap), but is still considering eating it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The mouse is asking if the cheese on the table is a trap, meaning, is it bait for a mouse trap. However, the word "trap" can also mean a difficult situation that someone cannot get out of, and in this context, the mouse is worried that the cheese might be a trap in that sense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at stereotypes: that businessmen are heartless and that mice are stupid. The woman in the business meeting is talking about a "trap" that she's set up, which the men and mouse know is referring to a business deal, but the mouse is thinking about a literal mouse trap, i.e., a trap baited with cheese. The joke is clever because it's a play on words (trap/trap) and because it's a play on the stereotype that mice are stupid.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the association of cheese with mouse traps: the mouse is dressed in a suit as if it is a business professional, yet the fact that it is eating cheese implies that it is being baited into a trap. Thus, the mouse is both a professional and a victim, which is an incongruous combination.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the mouse is dressed in a suit, which makes it appear to be a business professional, just like the humans in the room. However, the fact that the mouse is at the meeting makes it clear that it is not really a business professional, but is instead a mouse who has been tricked into attending the meeting by being given cheese (which is often used as bait on mouse traps). The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the mouse is in a "trap" (the meeting), but it is also in a literal "trap" (a mouse trap).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "trap": a trap can refer to a type of device that is used to catch animals (usually mice), or it can refer to a dangerous/unethical situation. In this case, the mouse is wondering if the business meeting is a trap in the sense that it might be a dangerous or unethical situation. The fact that there is cheese in the room adds to the joke, because cheese is often used as bait on mouse traps.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The mouse is asking if anyone thinks that the cheese on the table is a trap, when in reality, it's a trap for him because he's a mouse. The fact that he's dressed as a businessman also adds to the humor because it's unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker, a mouse, is aware that some of the other attendees at the meeting, who are human, might be thinking that he is there as bait for a mouse trap. This is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that mice are attracted to cheese, which is often used as bait in mouse traps.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "trap": a "trap" can be a cleverly laid out plan to capture someone or something, or it can be a physical device that is used to capture an animal (like a mouse). In this case, the mouse is thinking that the business meeting might be a trap set for him, with the cheese being the bait.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="86.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="88.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
