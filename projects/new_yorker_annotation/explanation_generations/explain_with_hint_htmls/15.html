The man on the phone is talking about how they managed to get the piano through the door, but the piano is so small that it's clear that they didn't have any difficulty moving it. The joke is clever because it's not just a play on words, but also a play on the expected size of a piano.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur. The man on the phone is discussing what appears to be the successful result of a mission or task, but the details of that mission were not what was expected. In this case, the man was probably expecting to hear about how hard it was to move the piano, but instead, the task was easy because the piano was so small.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man on the phone is talking about how they were able to get the piano through the doorway, but the joke is that the piano is so small that it's not a difficult feat. This situation is made funnier by the incongruity of a tiny man playing a piano in what is presumably a bedroom.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "good news" is that they were able to get the piano into the room, but the "bad news" is that the piano is so small that it's not going to be very useful. This is a reversal of the common situation, where the good news is that the piano is a good size, but the bad news is that it won't fit through the door.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because moving a piano is notoriously difficult, mostly because of the size of the piano and the difficulty of getting it through doorways. The joke plays on the incongruity of a very small piano, which would be easy to move through a doorway, but still requires some effort.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the phone is talking about how they had to move the piano into the room, and the fact that the piano is so small makes it clear that they had an easier time than usual because they didn't have to worry about getting it through the door.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man on the phone is talking about a difficult task (moving a piano), but the man on the piano is so small that the task of getting him through the doorway was easy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's relatable: anyone who's moved a piano knows that it's one of the hardest pieces of furniture to get through a door. The man on the phone is relaying good news to whomever he's talking to: they were able to get the piano through the doorway, implying that it's a very small piano.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The good news is that they were able to get the piano into the room, but the bad news is that the piano is very small. This is a reference to the common saying "the good news is, the bad news is."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "piano" can mean both the musical instrument and the adjective meaning "small." In this context, the "piano" is the musical instrument, but the joke is that it's so small that it was able to fit through the doorway easily, which is normally the hardest part about moving a piano.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it references the common difficulty of moving pianos: they are large and bulky, and often don't fit through doorways. The man is saying that the only good news in the current situation is that they were able to get the piano into the room, likely meaning that it was a particularly small piano.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man on the phone is talking about how they were able to get the piano through the door, which is usually a difficult task, but in this case it was easy because the piano was so small. This is a play on the phrase "that's the good news, and the bad news." In this case, the good news is that they were able to get the piano through the door, but the bad news is that it's because the piano is so tiny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man on the phone is talking about how they finally managed to get the piano through the doorway, which is typically one of the hardest parts of moving a piano. However, in this case, the piano is so small that it wasn't difficult to move it through the doorway. The joke is clever because it's a double meaning: the piano is small, but the man on the phone is also talking about the act of moving the piano, which is also small.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="14.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="16.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
