The joke is clever because it's a play on words --- the couple is reading the "rosetta stone", which is a stone that has writing on it that is very old. The fact that they are sitting and reading the same thing is a symbol for how their relationship is "stuck in a rut."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rosetta stone is an ancient artifact, and the husband and wife are sitting there reading it as if it's a normal book. The rosetta stone is famous for helping people decipher ancient hieroglyphics, so the joke is playing on the fact that the couple is sitting there trying to read something that is effectively meaningless to them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The couple is sitting in their living room, reading Rosetta Stones, which are stone tablets with ancient writing on them. The joke is that they are reading the same old thing, implying that they are bored with their current activity, but also that the content of what they are reading, the ancient writing, is old.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is sitting in their living room, with their dog at their feet, and they are both reading rosetta stones. The rosetta stone is a famous artifact because it helped scholars decipher egyptian hieroglyphics, which was a dead language. The joke is that the couple is sitting there, reading the same thing, not communicating with each other, just like the people who originally used the rosetta stone to try to communicate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The rosetta stone is a famous stone tablet that helped scholars decipher hieroglyphics, which is an ancient form of writing. The joke is implying that the couple's relationship is as old and stagnant as the rosetta stone itself, and that they can't communicate any better than people who are trying to decipher hieroglyphics.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rosetta stone is a famous artifact from ancient times. It's famous because it was used to help decipher hieroglyphics, which was a difficult task. However, the husband's comment implies that he's bored with the same old thing, which is ironic because the rosetta stone is so old and famous precisely because it doesn't change.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "same old, same old". In this case, the couple is reading from stone tablets, which are old, and thus the "same old". But, the joke is also funny because stone tablets don't change, and so the couple is stuck reading the "same old" thing every day.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is sitting in their living room reading the rosetta stone, which is an ancient Egyptian stone tablet that was used to decipher hieroglyphs. The joke is clever because it puns on the fact that the rosetta stone is old, and thus the writing on it is old, and thus the couple is reading something that is very old.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The couple is sitting and reading, but instead of reading books or newspapers, they are reading stone tablets. The joke is that they are reading the same old thing, because the tablets haven't changed, and they are probably reading the same thing as they always have.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "same old, same old" is typically used to describe something that is boring and unchanging, like a couple's routine behavior towards each other in marriage. However, in this case, the "same old" refers to the fact that the couple is reading from stone tablets, which are old and unchanging. The joke is clever because it takes a mundane, everyday event and makes it funny by adding an unexpected element.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. When people say "same old, same old," they usually mean that things are boring and unchanged. However, in this case, the couple is sitting and reading from stone tablets, which never change. So, in this case, the phrase "same old, same old" is appropriate because the things they are reading are actually the same old things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The couple is literally reading the same old thing --- the same stone tablet --- over and over. However, this could also be interpreted to mean that they are reading the same thing every day, i.e., that their lives are boring and uneventful.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rosetta stone is old, and it contains writing that is old. Thus, when the couple is sitting and reading the stone tablets, they are essentially reading the same thing over and over again. The joke is a play on the fact that often, married couples will say that they are "sitting and reading the same old thing" to describe how their relationship is going stale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully mocks the idea of a couple finding new and exciting things to do to spice up their relationship by referencing the very old and ancient rosetta stones. The joke is that, even though the couple is doing something new, it's still the same old thing (i.e., reading), just in a different format.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The rosetta stone is a block of stone with writing on it that is used to help decipher hieroglyphics. The couple is sitting and reading the rosetta stones, but because the stones don't change, they are effectively reading the same thing over and over again. This is similar to how people often say "it's the same old thing" to describe something that doesn't change.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="114.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="116.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
