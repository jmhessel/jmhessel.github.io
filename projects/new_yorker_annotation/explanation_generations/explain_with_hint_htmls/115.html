Use the good china.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is telling the man to use the good china, which is a form of tableware, while he is in the middle of throwing a discus. The word "throw" can mean both to toss something like a discus, or to have a party or gathering, which is what the woman is implicitly telling the man to do with the good china.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the multiple meanings of "use": the first meaning is that the man is using the good china (i.e., the bowling ball) to bowl with, and the second meaning is that the man is using his nudity to try to shock or embarrass the women. The women's unamused expressions suggest that they are not affected by the man's nudity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the double meaning of the word "throw." On one hand, the naked man is in a throwing stance with a ball in his hand, which could be interpreted as meaning that he is about to "throw" the ball. On the other hand, the naked man is also in a position where he could "throw up," or vomit, and so the woman's suggestion to use the good china is a play on the fact that he might get sick on it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is telling the other woman to use the good china, when in actuality, she should be telling the man to put some clothes on. The double meaning of "use" is what makes this joke funny --- the man is using the china as a discus, but the woman is telling him to use it as a place to eat from.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman says to use the good china, meaning the good plates, but the naked man is about to use the china, meaning throw it as part of his sport. The word play is confusing, but once the listener realizes that the man is about to throw a discus, it is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman says to use the good china, meaning the expensive plates, but the man is naked and about to throw a bowling ball, so she could also be telling him to use the toilet. The juxtaposition of the two meanings is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it uses a double meaning of the word "use". The first meaning is that the man is using the china (a type of bowl) to bowl. The second meaning is that the women expect the man to use the china to eat on, since he is naked. The women are unamused because they were expecting a normal tea party with just the two of them, but now they have to share their tea party with a naked man.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is telling her husband to use the good china, usually reserved for company, but in this case, the company is the naked man who is in the room with them, and so she is telling him to use the good china to eat off of. This play on words is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words: the naked man in the room is throwing a discus, but the woman says he should use the good china, meaning the good dishes. This is a play on words because normally when someone says use the good china, they mean to use the best dishes for company, but in this case, the man is literally using a plate as a discus.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman says to use the good china, but she could be telling the man to either use the good china plates because they have company, or to use the good china bowl because it is a better quality. The man, who is naked and has a ball in his hand, could be either about to throw the ball (hence, using the good china bowl) or about to eat from the good china plate. The ambiguity of the situation is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's husband is naked in the room, and she is telling him to use the good plates for their current company. The fact that he is naked implies that she is not referring to actual company, but is instead using "company" as a euphemism for the fact that he is about to have sex. Therefore, the plates she is referring to are not actual plates, but instead another euphemism for condom.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the use of the word "throw". The man in the room is either about to bowl, or pose like a statue, and the woman's comment about using the good china suggests that she is not impressed by his nakedness. However, the word "throw" also has a double meaning, in that, it can also refer to eating food off of a plate. Therefore, the woman's comment could also be interpreted as her telling the man to use a nice plate while he is eating, which would be appropriate given his current state of undress.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The speaker is telling the naked man, who is in the middle of the room, to "use the good china," which could either mean that he should use the nice dishes because they have company, or that he should use the dishes to eat on (as in, to have a meal). The ambiguity is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "use". In the context of the scene, the woman is telling her husband to use the good china because they have company, i.e., to use it for the tea party. However, "use" can also mean "to throw", as in, to throw a discus. The naked man in the scene is throwing a discus, which is a bit odd given that he is nude. The joke is that the woman's husband is being asked to use (throw) the good china (discus) instead of using it for tea.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's words can be interpreted in two ways. She could either be telling her husband to use the good china because they have company, or she could be telling him to use the good china because he's about to throw it at the naked man in the room. The double meaning is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="114.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="116.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
