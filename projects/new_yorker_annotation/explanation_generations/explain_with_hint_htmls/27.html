The joke highlights how silly it would be to ask that question on such a long time scale, and how unhelpful it would be to try and compare one's current circumstances to those of billions of years ago.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on a common political trope, in which one candidate will ask the electorate if they are better off now than they were before the other candidate's policies were implemented. In this case, the time frame being asked about is the entire age of the Earth, which is an absurdly long time. The joke is funny because it's impossible for anyone to know if they are better off now than they were four billion years ago.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common political campaign tactic of asking voters if they are better off now than they were before the opposing candidate's policies were enacted. In this case, the candidate is asking if the voters are better off than they were four billion years ago, which is an absurdly long time period, and the answer is obviously no.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on a common political campaign slogan: "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?" The candidate is asking if the Earth is better off now than it was four billion years ago, which is an absurdly long time. The joke is clever because it's a way to make fun of how long Earth has been around for, while also making a dig at how campaign slogans are often empty rhetoric.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on a common political campaign slogan: "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?" The joke substitutes "four years ago" for "four billion years ago" to emphasize how long Earth has been around, and thus, how long the Earth's current condition has been maintained.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on a common political trope. In political debates, candidates will often ask the voters if they are better off now than they were before the other candidate's policies were in place. In this case, the debate is between a human and Earth, with Earth taking the place of a political opponent. The joke is clever because it makes a valid point: humans have only been around for a tiny fraction of Earth's history, so it's unlikely that we have made much of a positive impact in the grand scheme of things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common political campaign slogan "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?" In this case, the man is debating with Earth itself, and is asking if we (humans) are better off now than we were when the Earth was formed four billion years ago. The answer, of course, is no, we are not better off --- we didn't even exist four billion years ago!</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on a common political debating tactic, wherein one candidate will ask the voters if they are better off now than they were before the other candidate's policies were enacted. In this case, the man on stage is debating with Earth itself, and the time frame he uses is the age of Earth, which is4 billion years old. This time frame is so long that it's impossible for anyone to say with certainty that they are better off now, four billion years later.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is making a political appeal to the audience, asking them if they are better off now than they were before his policies were enacted. This joke cleverly substitutes the age of the earth for the length of time his policies have been in place, implying that his policies have made the world a better place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on a common politicalattack line "are you better off now than you were four years ago?" The joke is that, instead of four years, the time frame is the entirety of the Earth's existence, which dates back billions of years. This time frame is so long that it's impossible for the person on stage to have been alive for even a small fraction of it, let alone have any impact on it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "better off." In a political debate, the phrase is often used to ask whether voters are better off now than they were before the opposing party's policies were enacted. However, in this instance, the man is debating Earth itself, and is asking whether Earth is better off now than it was four billion years ago. This is a humorous comparison because four billion years is a very long time, and it's unlikely that anything has improved on Earth during that time span.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "better off": in a normal context, this phrase would refer to whether a person is doing better financially, physically, etc. under a particular politician's policies. However, in this context, the man is debating with Earth itself, so the phrase takes on a literal meaning: are humans better off now, four billion years after Earth was formed, than they were when the planet was first formed?</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the podium is making a political appeal, asking if the people in the room are better off now than they were before his policies were implemented. However, he then reframes the question in terms of the age of the earth, saying "four billion years ago." This joke is a play on the fact that the earth is very old, and thus most people would not be able to say whether or not they were better off four billion years ago.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common political question "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?" The question is typically asked during an election year in order to appeal to voters, but in this case, the time frame is the age of the earth. The joke implies that, no matter who is in office, the earth (and by extension, the people on it) have not progressed very much in four billion years.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on a common political campaign tactic, in which a candidate will ask voters if they are better off now than they were before their opponents' policies were enacted. In this case, the debate is between the man and the planet Earth, and the planet is asking the man if he's better off now than he was four billion years ago: the answer, of course, is no, which makes it a good put-down.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="26.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="28.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
