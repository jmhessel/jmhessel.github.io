"Sleeping on your side" is a metaphor for not pushed into a corner or not being in a dangerous/precarious situation, i.e., not expanding into Native American territory which might result in getting shot by arrows.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor's advice to "sleep on your side" is a double entendre. On one hand, the doctor is giving a literal suggestion to help the cowboy's arrows not hurt as much. But, on the other hand, "sleep on your side" can also mean "don't expand too much and cross into Native American territory" --- which is ironic, given that the cowboy was just shot with arrows by Native Americans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is telling the cowboy to sleep on his side, which is sound medical advice for avoiding back pain when you have arrows sticking out of you. However, this advice is also a veiled suggestion from the doctor to not expand into native american territory, which is a reference to the previous scene.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The doctor is literally telling the cowboy to sleep on his side, but the phrase "sleep on your side" can also mean to not take action on something, in this case to not expand into native american territory. The joke is clever because it's a hint that the doctor might be sympathetic to the native americans, even though the cowboy is a settler.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The doctor is trying to help the cowboy by suggesting he sleep on his side, to ease the pain from the arrows, but the phrase can also be interpreted as meaning "don't cross into Native American territory." The cowboy, being shot by arrows, is already in pain, so the suggestion is moot; but, it's still a funny way to phrase it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor's advice to "sleep on your side" has a dual meaning: in one sense, the doctor is giving literal advice to the cowboy to help him heal from his wounds, but in another sense, the doctor is telling the cowboy to not expand into Native American territory, since that is likely what got him into this situation in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor's suggestion to "sleep on your side" is a pun. On the one hand, the doctor is trying to give the cowboy a literal piece of advice for dealing with his arrow wounds. On the other hand, the phrase "sleep on your side" is also a idiom meaning "to not take action," which in this case would be a reference to the famous phrase "Don't tread on me." The cowboy is being shot by arrows because he has tread on Native American land, and the doctor's joke is a subtle way of telling him to stop.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "sleeping on your side" is both something that a doctor might say to a patient with an injury, but it's also a euphemism for "don't cross into Native American territory". The joke is clever because it uses the double meaning of the phrase to make a commentary on the situation: the doctor is telling the cowboy to not cross into Native American territory, but the cowboy is too injured to understand the hidden meaning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor's advice to "sleep on your side" is a double-meaning. In one sense, the doctor is telling the cowboy to try to sleep on his side to ease the pain of the arrows. However, the phrase can also be interpreted to mean "don't expand into native american territory", which is what the cowboy is presumably doing since he has so many arrows in him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is giving the cowboy a very serious medical advice to "sleep on his side" in order to reduce the risk of pneumonia. However, the phrase can also be interpreted to mean "don't expand your territory into Native American land", which is what the cowboy is probably doing. The doctor's advice, while well-meaning, is actually quite ironic given the context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor's advice to "sleep on your side" can be interpreted in two ways. The first way is literal, in that the doctor is suggesting that the cowboy try to sleep on his side to ease his pain. The second way is a veiled suggestion from the doctor not to expand into Native American territory, which is a historical sore spot between cowboys and Native Americans. The joke is funny because it is a clever play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is suggesting a common remedy for pain relief ("sleeping on your side"), but this is also comical advice given the fact that the cowboy has arrows sticking out of his body. The joke is also a play on words, as "side" can also refer to one's position in a conflict, i.e., the cowboy's "side" in the conflict with the native americans. The doctor's suggestion of sleeping on his side can thus be interpreted as advice to not expand into native american territory.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of the doctor's advice. In a normal scenario, the doctor would be telling the cowboy to sleep on his side in order to ease the pain of the arrows. However, in this context, "sleep on your side" also means to not expand into native american territory, which is what the cowboy is presumably trying to do. The joke is a play on the different meanings of the phrase.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "sleeping on your side" can mean two things: literally, it means to sleep in a position where you are lying on your side; but it can also mean to not expand into someone else's territory (i.e., to not encroach on another person's land). So, the doctor is giving the cowboy a literal and figurative piece of advice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor's advice to "sleep on your side" is both a sensible suggestion for someone who has been shot by arrows, and also a not-so-subtle jab at the cowboy's previous actions. "Sleeping on your side" can also mean not doing something that wouldresult in conflict, in this case, expanding into Native American territory. So, the doctor is essentially telling the cowboy that he brought this upon himself and he should have known better.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="26.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="28.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
