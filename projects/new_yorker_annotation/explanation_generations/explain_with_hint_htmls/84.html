The speaker is stressing how bad the current situation is, but also how it could be much worse, making the joke funny in a dark way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the common intern experience. In many workplaces, interns are assigned menial tasks like filing documents. The joke suggests that, in this office, the interns are also tasked with fighting off a tiger in order to do their filing. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the literal meaning of "fighting off a tiger" is contrasted with the more common phrase "to intern" which usually refers to an opportunity to work at a company to gain experience.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the fact that internships are often thankless and low-level jobs that require a lot of work with little payoff. The joke is that the situation the man is in --- having to fight a tiger to file some documents --- is just another example of how his internship is full of difficult and strange tasks.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is so absurd and dangerous. The fact that the speakers act like this is a regular occurrence for interns shows how internships can often be thankless and full of unexpected tasks, like having to fight a tiger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of having to deal with a tiger in the office, it references the common experience of internships being thankless and full of menial tasks. The joke suggests that this is just another hazard that interns have to deal with.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the tiger is a dangerous animal, it's something that the workers have to deal with on a regular basis. The tiger is a metaphor for the difficulties and dangerous tasks that interns have to do, which are often thankless. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words --- the phrase "remember when" is often used to reference fond memories, but in this case, the workers are remembering a time when they had to deal with a tiger, which is not a fond memory.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's referencing the common experience of internships: they are often seen as thankless and difficult, with the intern having to do all the work while the managers or more experienced employees get all the credit. In this case, the joke is making a comparison between the difficult task of fighting a tiger and the difficult task of being an intern.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because interns often have to do tasks that are thankless and no one else wants to do, like getting the mail or getting coffee. In this case, the intern has to deal with a tiger, which is even more dangerous and thankless. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the tiger is in the "filing cabinet", which is where interns are often tasked with putting documents.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while internships are often thankless and low-level jobs, they usually don't involve life-threatening tasks like dealing with a tiger. The fact that the two office workers are reminiscing about their days as interns, when they had to deal with the tiger, suggests that this is a fairly common occurrence, which is both darkly humorous and relatable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two office workers are interns who have to deal with a tiger in the office. It's a reference to the common complaints about internships: that they are often thankless jobs where workers are given little-to-no responsibility or are treated poorly. In this case, the interns have to deal with a tiger, which is a rather extreme example of an intern being treated poorly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a common stereotype that internships are mostly thankless and unpaid work. In this case, the joke takes that one step further by saying that not only is the intern working for free, but he also has to deal with a tiger. This is a difficult and dangerous task, which makes the internship even more thankless.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is saying thatinternships are difficult and thankless, but it's something that everyone has to go through. The fact that there's a tiger in the office---a dangerous and potentially deadly animal---is just another hazard that interns have to deal with. The joke is a way of commiserating with the man who is currently facing down the tiger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "intern" can refer to both a student who is working in a company to gain experience, and also a person who is in prison. Thus, the joke is that the tattered man's situation, being attacked by a tiger while trying to put documents in a file cabinet, is similar to an intern's, in that they are both in thankless positions and are constantly under attack.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a relatable situation for many interns, who often have to do thankless tasks like putting files away. The addition of the tiger makes the situation more dangerous and absurd, which is what makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it's common for internships to be low-paying and for interns to have to do a lot of grunt work, it's not common for them to have to deal with tigers in the office. The joke is clever because it takes a familiar office situation, the filing cabinet, and makes it more dangerous and exotic by adding in the tiger.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="83.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="85.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
