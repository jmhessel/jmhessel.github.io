The Ring Cycle, by German composer Richard Wagner, is a set of operas that begins with a viking theme, which is how the association between opera and vikings began. In this case, the joke is that the two vikings met each other at the opera, which is a very unlikely place for them to meet.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that vikings, while they didn't have Christian weddings, were often associated with the opera because of Wagner's "The Ring Cycle." The joke imagines a viking meeting their spouse at the opera, which is a very unlikely scenario, and thus, funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because opera is usually seen as a highbrow, cultured activity, while vikings are typically associated with being rough and uncivilized. The joke is clever because it uses the common operatic trope of characters in viking garb (from Wagner's "The Ring Cycle" specifically), to make a contrast with the typical operatic setting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that opera is a "highbrow" form of entertainment, while Vikings are usually associated with being more primitive and barbaric. The idea that two people who are seemingly opposite could meet at the opera and fall in love is funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is dressed like Vikings, which is a culture known for being fierce warriors. However, they met at the opera, which is something that Viking's wouldn't be typically associated with. The joke is poking fun at the fact that their meeting place is unexpected given their cultural background.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the setting is a Christian wedding, which vikings would not have had, and because the bridesmaids are making light conversation about the unusual wedding. The association of vikings with opera comes from the fact that many of the works by the composer Richard Wagner, which are often called "operas," have viking-themed stories, such as "The Ring Cycle." Thus, the joke is that the vikings at this wedding met each other through their shared love of opera.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two bridesmaids are dressed as vikings, which is an unusual choice for a wedding. The joke is explaining how the couple met: they met at the opera, which is perhaps a more refined setting than one would expect for two people who would later dress as vikings for their wedding. The joke is clever because it is a play on the stereotype that people who like opera are "highbrow" or "uppity."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in the opera "The Ring Cycle" by Wagner, the first opera in the series is called "The Rheingold," which is about the theft of the Rheingold (a gold ring) by a group of dwarves. This is similar to the situation in the wedding, where there are three bridesmaids (similar to the three dwarves) and two grooms (similar to the two main characters in the opera).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the stereotype that people who like opera are vikings. This is a reference to the opera club scene in The Simpsons, where the Simpsons go to an opera and are the only ones not dressed as vikings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because people often dress up for the opera, and so it's not that unusual for the couple to have met each other while they were both dressed as vikings. However, the fact that they are now getting married while still in viking gear is a bit unusual, and so the joke is that they met each other while they were both "in character" so to speak.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "they met at the opera" can mean two things: either the couple met each other at an opera performance, or the couple is so in love that their relationship is like an opera, i.e., melodramatic. In this case, the couple actually met each other at a performance of Wagner's "The Ring Cycle," which is an opera about Norse gods, hence the viking costume. The joke is clever because it is a double meaning that is also a pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Viking-themed weddings are not common, and so the suggestion that the couple met at the opera is humorous because it's an unexpected place for two people who are now dressing up like Vikings to have met. The opera connection is also a reference to the fact that Wagner's "The Ring Cycle" began the association between opera and vikings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because often, people who are interested in opera are older and more sophisticated than people who are interested in vikings. The Wagner opera "The Ring Cycle" is particularly well-known for its connection to vikings, so the joke is making a contrast between the two groups of people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that opera is for rich, snobby people. The picture shows a Viking-themed wedding, with two grooms and three bridesmaids. If they met at the opera, it would be a surprising place for two people dressed like Vikings to meet. The joke is clever because it's not just a play on the opera stereotype, but also on the fact that the opera "The Ring Cycle" by Wagner is set in a mythical world of dwarves and dragons, which is evocative of Viking culture.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple's unusual choice of Vikinger-themed wedding implies that they are probably very into the opera. This is because Wagner's "The Ring Cycle" began the association between opera and vikings.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="11.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="13.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
