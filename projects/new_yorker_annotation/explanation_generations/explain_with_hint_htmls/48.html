The giant books are surrounding them, so the person says they are "literally surrounded." However, since the books are animate and have faces, the person could also be saying that they are "literarily surrounded," which would mean that they are surrounded by literature.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The people are surrounded by large books, and they are scared because the books are so big. However, the books are not actually alive, so the people are not literally surrounded.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is "literally surrounded" by books, meaning that there are a lot of them. But the joke is also clever because "literally surrounded" can mean that they are enclosed on all sides by books, which is not the case. The couple is actually just figuratively surrounded by books, which is a much less alarming situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the book people are both anthropomorphized (i.e. they have human characteristics) and they are also literarily book people. The fact that they are literarily book people means that they are actually made of books, which is a play on the word "literally." The joke is funny because the book people are both anthropomorphized (i.e. they have human characteristics) and they are also literarily book people.

The books are angry, and the couple is surrounded by them. The couple is literarily (pun intended) surrounded by the books, but they are also surrounded by the books literally. The couple is in a dangerous situation, and the joke is funny because of the play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is surrounded by anthropomorphized books, which are normally inanimate objects. The couple is joking that the direness of their situation by saying that they are "literally" surrounded, even though the books are not actually alive and pose no real threat to them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The couple is surrounded by books, which is a metaphor for them being "surrounded by literature." However, they are also literally surrounded by books, which is a much less threatening situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is "literally" surrounded by books, but the books are not actually alive, they are justanimate objects. The couple's use of the word "literally" is incorrect, but in the context of being surrounded by so many books, it's a funny mistake to make.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The couple is saying that they are "literally surrounded" by the books, meaning that the books are close to them in physical space. However, the books are also "literally" angry, meaning that they are angry in the sense that they are alive and have human emotions. Therefore, the couple is both physically and psychologically surrounded by the books.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is surrounded by books, which is a metaphor for being "surrounded" by things that one needs to read. However, the couple takes the metaphor literally and says that they are "literally surrounded" by the books.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the word "literally" is often misused to mean "figuratively". In this case, the couple is "literally" surrounded by books, but they are not in danger, because books can't hurt people. However, the fact that the books are anthropomorphized, or given human characteristics, makes the scene a bit more menacing, and the couple's fear is more understandable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "literally" is being used in its literal sense instead of its figurative sense. In this case, the books are actually surrounding the people, so the statement that they are "literally surrounded" is true. However, it's funny because usually when people say they are "literally surrounded," they are exaggerating for emphasis, not actually describing a factual situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is surrounded by books, which are traditionally associated with being "literary" or educated. However, in this instance, the books are angry and anthropomorphized, so the couple is actually "literally" surrounded by books. This is a play on words because "literally" is often overused to mean "figuratively".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words.
