A fire down by the old Jetson's house?</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In the TV show "The Jetsons," the family has a robot dog named "Astro." In the opening credits of the show, there is a scene where Astro is chasing a cat and he goes past a fire hydrant and a fire truck. The sound effect for when he goes past the fire hydrant is a siren, which makes it sound like he's going to save the day. In the joke, the dog is in a spaceship surrounded by aliens, and one of the aliens says "What is boy?" and the other aliens say "A fire down by the old Jetson's house?" and the first alien says "Lassie!" which is a reference to the dog who saved people from fires.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it uses a cultural reference to the TV show The Jetsons to make a joke about the aliens' misunderstanding of the dog. In the show, the family has a robotic dog named Astro. In the context of the joke, the aliens mistake the dog for a robot, and thus think that it must be some kind of primitive fire-fighting machine, like something from The Jetsons. The joke is made funnier by the fact that there really was a dog named Lassie who was known for saving people from fires.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the television show "The Jetsons" and the dog character Lassie. In the show, the family's pet dog saves people from a fire. Given that the aliens are staring at the dog, the joke suggests that they are waiting for the dog to save them from some sort of fire, just like Lassie did on the television show.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The Jetsons is a classic cartoon TV show about a futuristic family that lives in space, and one of the characters is a dog named Lassie. Lassie is famous for being a dog that saves people from fires, so the joke is that the aliens in the spaceship are asking if the dog is a boy or a fire.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "boy" can mean a male child, or it can be short for "boy scout." In this case, the aliens are asking if the dog is a boy scout, and the joke is that they are confusing the word "boy" with "boy scout."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "boy" can mean either a male child or a servant, and in this context, the extraterrestrial creatures seem to be confusing the two meanings. Furthermore, the joke is a reference to the classic TV show The Jetsons, which featured a family with a robot servant, and also to Lassie, the Dog who famously saved people from fires.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The aliens are asking the dog what a "boy" is, and the dog responds with a reference to the Jetsons TV show, which is about a family living in the future. In the show, there is a dog named Lassie who saves people from fires, so the dog is effectively saying that a boy is someone who is in danger and needs to be saved.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the aliens in the spaceship are trying to communicate with the dog, but they are having difficulty understanding it. They ask what a "boy" is, and the dog looks confused. The aliens are probably referring to the term "boy" as in "male human," but the dog doesn't understand that. The aliens then try to explain it by referring to the Jetsons, a TV show about a family in the future. This is still confusing for the dog, so the aliens give up and just label the dog as a "fire down by the old Jetson's house." This is a reference to the TV show Lassie, where the dog would often save people from fires.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The aliens are asking what a "boy" is, and the answer they're given is "a fire." This is a reference to the TV show The Jetsons, which takes place in the future, and to the dog Lassie, who is known for saving people from fires.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the extraterrestrial beings are confusing a dog for a human boy. This is a play on the traditional "boy"/"girl" dichotomy, where humans are distinguished by gender. However, the aliens don't have the same concept of gender, and instead are confusing the dog for a human boy because of its fur coat. The joke also references the popular TV show The Jetsons, which featured a talking dog, and the character Lassie, who was known for saving people from fires.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the classic cartoon "The Jetsons". In that show, the dog was named Astro, and he was always getting into trouble. In this case, the aliens have captured a dog, and they are trying to figure out what it is. They ask if it's a fire, and the dog responds, which makes the aliens think that the dog is intelligent.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the aliens are trying to understand what a "boy" is by referencing a popular TV show from the 1960s, "The Jetsons". In the show, the family has a robot maid named Rosie. In the scene where the aliens are asking about the dog, they say "What is boy? A fire down by the old Jetson's house?" This is a reference to the popular TV show "Lassie", in which a dog saves people from a fire. The joke is clever because it uses two popular TV shows from the 1960s to explain a concept to aliens that is completely foreign to them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the aliens are trying to figure out what a dog is and they make a reference to the old TV show The Jetsons. In that show, the family had a robot dog, which is probably what these aliens are thinking of. However, they also make a reference to Lassie, who was a real dog who often saved people from fires. This is funny because it shows how the aliens are misunderstanding what a dog is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it conflates two very different things: the character Lassie from the TV show "Lassie" who was a heroic dog that saved people from fires, and the cartoon TV show "The Jetsons" which is set in the future. In the context of the aliens observing the dog, the speaker is asking if the dog is some kind of fire-fighting robot, like Lassie, but from the future.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the television show "The Jetsons," which takes place in the future, and Lassie, a dog known for saving people from fires. The joke is funny because it imagines a scenario in which a dog from the past is transported to the future and is then saved by a dog from the future.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
