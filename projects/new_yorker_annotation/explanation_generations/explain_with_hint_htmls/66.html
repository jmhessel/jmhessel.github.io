A "stable" stock is a good stock, one that is not going to fluctuate wildly in value. Thus, the man in the crib is only able to sleep through the night if the stock market is stable, i.e., the stocks he has invested in are doing well. However, the literal meaning of "stable" is a place where babies sleep, i.e., a crib. So the joke is also funny because the man is sleeping in a crib like a baby, which is not something that adults normally do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. A "stable" market means that stocks are not fluctuating wildly, and thus it's a good time to invest. However, the man in the crib is not stable, i.e., he's a baby, and he's being woken up by bad news, i.e., the market is crashing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idea that a baby crying in the night might wake up their parents. In this case, the man in the crib, who is a stock market investor, is only awakened by bad news about the stock market. The joke implies that he is a child-like person who is only interested in the stock market, and not in other aspects of life.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "He sleeps like a baby." The man in the crib is a stock investor, and he's only able to sleep through the night if the stock market is stable. However, if there's bad news in the stock market, he'll be awoken just like a baby would be if there was a noise in the night.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. When a baby sleeps through the night, it's considered a good thing because the baby is well-rested. However, the stock investor in this crib is only sleeping through the night if the stock market is stable; if there's bad news, he'll wake up. The implication is that he's a grown man acting like a baby, only caring about himself and his money.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the business suit is acting like a baby. He's in a crib, sucking his thumb, and he's even wearing a diaper. However, the fact that he's also a stock investor means that he's an adult who is worrying about the stock market. The joke is funny because it's a play on the idea that babies cry and adults worry.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the crib is an adult, and should rightfully be sleeping in a bed, not a crib. However, he is dressed in a suit, implying that he is a businessperson, and is sucking his thumb, which is a sign of distress. The joke is that he can only sleep soundly through the night if the stock market is stable, implying that he is a stock investor. If the stock market is unstable, he wakes up in a panic, just like a baby would if they were Crying.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the man in the crib is a stock market investor, and the usual phrase is "he sleeps through the night," meaning, the baby/child sleeps through the night without waking up. In this case, the man in the crib sleeps through the night as long as the stock market is stable, but if there is bad news, the stock market crashes and he wakes up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words; the man in the crib is a stock market investor, and babies typically sleep through the night. However, this man is only able to sleep through the night if the stock market is stable; if there is bad news, he will be awoken by it. The joke is clever because it's a pun on the word "stable."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "sleep through the night" is often used to describe how well a baby sleeps, meaning they don't wake up in the middle of the night. However, the man in the business suit is a stock investor, and the joke is that he sleeps through the night as long as the stock market is stable, but if the stock market takes a turn for the worse, he will be woken up by the bad news.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the juxtaposition of the image of a man in a business suit sleeping in a baby's crib with the explanation that he only sleeps through the night if the stock market is stable. The joke is clever because it's a play on the common saying "he sleeps like a baby", which means he sleeps very soundly. However, in this case, the man sleeps soundly only if the stock market is stable, which is usually not the case.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the crib is an adult, and should not be sleeping in a crib. He is likely there because he is a stock investor, and the joke is referencing how the stock market can be unstable and unpredictable. The man in the crib is sleeping through the night because the market is stable, but if there is bad news, he will be woken up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the crib is a stock market investor, and he is only able to sleep through the night if the stock market is doing well. However, the fact that he is in a crib signifies that he is behaving like a baby, and babies are known for being easily awoken by things like loud noises or sudden movements. In this case, the man is awoken by bad news in the stock market, which is the equivalent of a loud noise or sudden movement for a baby.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because investors, especially stock investors, are often compared to babies. This is because they are both vulnerable and need someone to take care of them. In this case, the man in the suit is a stock investor, and he's so invested in the market that he literally sleeps in a crib. The joke is made funnier by the fact that he's not a real baby, but a grown man.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the crib is a stock market investor, and the phrase "He sleeps through the night" is often used to describe young babies who sleep well through the night. However, in this scenario, the man sleeps through the night because he is only awoken by bad news in the stock market.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="65.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="67.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
