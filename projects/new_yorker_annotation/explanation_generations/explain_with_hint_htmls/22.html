He's telling the judge to "think of a number" as if he's going to perform a trick, but the reality is that he's going to be stuck in prison for a long time. This contrast is funny because it's unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The magician has been sentenced to a long prison sentence, and so the judge is saying that in magician language, which is often used to trick people. The joke is that the magician is literally thinking of a number between 20 and life, which is the range of his sentence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the sentence the judge is giving the witness is a very specific type of sentence that a magician might use when asking someone to think of a number. The fact that the sentence is for a serious crime, like 20 years to life in prison, makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a magician's typical patter, they often ask the person to "think of a number, any number" as part of a trick. Here, the joke is that the witness, who is probably a magician, is sentenced to a number of years in jail using the same patter. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the witness is asked to think of a number, and they are given a number (their sentence).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the witness stand is a magician, and the judge is sentencing him using magician language. "I'm thinking of a number between 20 to life" is a standard magician's opening line when they are about to ask someone to choose a number. However, in this context, the judge is using it to sentence the man, which is an unexpected and humorous twist.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the witness, who is a magician, is sentenced to a jail term using magician language. The phrase "think of a number, any number" is a common phrase used by magicians to get their audience to volunteer a number, which the magician can then use in their trick. However, in this case, the magician is the one being tricked, because the number he chooses will determine how long he spends in jail.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the magician is sentenced using magician language. The judge says "I'm thinking of a number between 20 to life," which is a joke because the magician is going to be sentenced to a number of years in prison, not asked to guess a number. This is a play on the fact that magicians often ask their audience to "think of a number, any number."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The magician is sentenced to a number of years in jail, but he expresses it in the language of a magician's trick. He says he's thinking of a number, which is what magicians often ask their audience members to do when they are about to perform a trick. In this case, the number is 20 to life, which is a very long sentence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the witness is a magician, and the judge is sentencing him using a magician's phrase. The joke is clever because it's a play on words; the sentence is technically correct, but it's not what the judge meant to say.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the witness is a magician, and he is talking to the judge in the language of magic tricks. He is saying that he is thinking of a number, which is a common opening line for a magic trick. However, in this case, the number he is thinking of is 20 to life, which is a sentence for a criminal. The joke is a play on words, because the magician is using the phrase "any number" to mean that he is thinking of a number, but the sentence he is thinking of is actually a very specific number.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the witness is a magician, and he is using magician language to respond to the judge. Magicians often ask people to "think of a number, any number" as part of a trick, and so the witness is using this language to deflect the question.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the magician is making a joke about his sentence using magician language. He's thinking of a number between 20 and life, which is the range of his sentence, and saying that in a way that's similar to how magicians ask people to "think of a number, any number." This is amusing because it's a clever play on words.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="21.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="23.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
