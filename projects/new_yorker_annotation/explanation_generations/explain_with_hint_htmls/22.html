However, in this case, the pirate teller is suggesting that the customer open an actual "offshore account": an account that is physically located offshore, on a pirate ship perhaps.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The pirate teller is asking the customer if they want to open an offshore account, which is a bank account in another country where the taxes are lower. However, the pirate teller is also asking if the customer wants to open an account that is literally offshore, as in, on a ship in the middle of the ocean.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays with the stereotype of pirates being associated with hidden treasure and being from a "different world" than the law-abiding citizens waiting in line at the bank. The fact that the teller is a pirate re-contextualizes the phrase "offshore account", which is usually used to mean a bank account in a different country in order to avoid taxes. However, in this context, an "offshore account" would literally be a bank account that is hidden away on a pirate ship, out in the middle of the ocean.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The pirate bank teller is offering to open an offshore account for the customer, but in this context, "offshore" is also a synonym for " illegal." The customer is being asked if they want to open an illegal account, which is a humorous way of suggesting that the pirate is going to steal their money.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Offshore account" can mean two things: (1) a bank account that is in another country, or (2) a hiding place for money that is illegal or undeclared. In this case, the pirate teller is offering a hiding place for money that is probably illegal or undeclared --- which is what pirates are typically associated with.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bank teller is a pirate, so he is literally offering to open an "offshore account." This is a play on words because "offshore" usually refers to a place where there are no taxes, so it's a good place to hide money. However, in this case, the offshore account is literally an account that is located offshore, i.e., on a boat in the middle of the ocean.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because this is a play on words. When people ask if you want to open an "offshore account," they are usually talking about an account in a foreign bank that can help you avoid taxes. However, in this context, the word "offshore" takes on a new meaning: the pirate teller is literally offering to open an account for the customer on a ship offshore, which is where pirates typically live. This is a play on words that is funny because it is unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. When a person talks about an "offshore account," they usually mean a bank account in a different country where they can deposit their money to avoid taxes. In this case, the bank teller is a pirate, so she literally has an offshore account --- a boat that is anchored offshore.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the pirate teller is offering an offshore account, which is usually used to hide assets and money from the government to avoid taxes, to the customers. However, in this case, the pirate is actually offering an account that is offshore, or literally out at sea. This would be a terrible place to store money, since it would be vulnerable to storms, erosion, and other natural disasters.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the pirate bank teller is offering to help the customers open an "offshore account." This is a play on words because, while an offshore account is a type of banking account that is held in a country different from where the account holder lives, in this case, the pirate teller is literal offering to take the money and keep it on a ship offshore. This is not what the customer is expecting, and so it's humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the pirate is a bank teller and is offering to open an offshore account for the customers. This is ironic because offshore accounts are usually used to hide money from the government, and pirates are associated with breaking the law. So, the pirate is offering to help the customers break the law, which is funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the pirate teller is offering an account that is literally "offshore", as in, not in the same country. This is a play on words because often times people will open "offshore accounts" in order to avoid taxes; the joke is that the pirate teller is offering an account that is even more offshore than those kinds of accounts.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the pirate bank teller is offering an 'offshore account', which is a type of bank account that is located in a different country in order to avoid taxes. The irony is that the pirate is already 'offshore', or not in his home country, so the offer is moot.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully imagines what a pirate bank teller would be like. In this case, the teller is offering an offshore account, which is a type of bank account that is often used to avoid taxes. This is ironic because it's unlikely that a pirate would be concerned about following the law, yet, here the pirate is trying to help the customer avoid taxes.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "pirate" is someone who breaks the law, and an "offshore account" is an account that is held in a country outside of the one where the person resides, which can be done to avoid paying taxes. So, the pirate bank teller is literally offering to open an offshore account, which is a place where the pirate can store their stolen money.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="21.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="23.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
