I'm in a meeting.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at the struggles of working from home. In this case, the person's work has invaded their personal space so much that they have set up a desk on the sidewalk, which is clearly disruptive to those around them. However, the person is more concerned with their partner bothering them than with the fact that they are blocking the sidewalk.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common work-from-home struggle of finding a quiet place to work. In this case, the person has set up their desk on the sidewalk, which is the polar opposite of a quiet place, but they are still trying to act like they are in a meeting. The absurdity is heightened by the fact that they are complaining to their partner about the noise, but instead of asking them to close the window or door to help muffle the noise, they are asking their partner to close the door, which would do nothing to help the noise situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common work-from-home struggles that many people are experiencing during the COVID pandemic. The man has been forced to set up his desk outside on the street because his partner is working from home and there's no other space for him to work. However, even though he's the one who's being inconvenienced by the work-from-home setup, he's the one who's complaining about his partner (who is presumably inside the apartment).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common work-from-home struggles that many people are experiencing during the pandemic. The person with the desk on the sidewalk is trying to concentrate and get work done, but the constant noise and foot traffic is making it difficult. However, instead of complaining about the noise and people, they are instead complaining about their partner coming in and out of the door, which isn't a problem that would normally be associated with working from home.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's husband is working from home, but he has set up his desk in the middle of the sidewalk instead of inside their apartment. She is trying to be polite and not disturb his work, but the fact that he is working in such a public place is causing her problems.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person with the desk is trying to work from home, but the desk is in the middle of the sidewalk, and they are complaining about the noise from their partner coming from inside the door, which is a more traditional place for a desk to be. The joke is a play on the common struggle of people trying to work from home, but in this case, the situation is taken to an extreme.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common complaints people have about working from home: specifically, the challenges of finding a quiet place to work. In this case, the person has set up their desk on the sidewalk, which is the opposite of a quiet place, and yet they are still being disturbed. The joke is that the person is being disturbed by their partner, who is in the doorway, rather than by the noise on the street.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common telecommuting/work from home struggle of trying to find a quiet place to work. The person in the joke has set up their desk on the sidewalk, which is a very public and noisy place, yet they are still trying to act like they are in a professional meeting. The fact that they are complaining about their partner closing the door suggests that the person is really struggling to concentrate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the seriousness of the telecommuter's work environment and the casualness of their partner's interruption. The joke is also funny because the telecommuter's work set-up is so strange and unexpected that it's hard to believe that it's real.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common telecommuting/work from home struggle of trying to find a quiet place to work. In this case, the person has set up their desk in the middle of the sidewalk, which is a very public and noisy place. But despite this, they are still distracted by their partner coming in and out of the door, revealing that the work from home struggle is often more about finding peace and quiet within one's own home, rather than in their external environment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common work-from-home struggle of trying to find a quiet place to work. In this case, the person has set up their desk on the sidewalk, which is usually a very public and noisy place. However, even though they are in a noisy place, they are still trying to have a meeting and are telling their partner to close the door so they can concentrate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common struggles of people who are now working from home: they often have to contend with noisy partners/children/pets, and may have to take their work outside to get any peace and quiet. In this case, the person has gone so far as to set up their desk on the sidewalk, but they are still being interrupted by their partner coming in and out of the front door.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person with the desk is clearly struggling to find a quiet place to work from home, and so they've set up a desk in the middle of the sidewalk, causing an obstruction. Yet, despite this, they are still more concerned with their partner disturbing their work by coming in the front door than the noise of the street.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the scene is a typical "work from home" scenario that has been set-up in an atypical way (a desk in the middle of the sidewalk). The person is clearly struggling to concentrate with all the noise and commotion going on around them, but instead of asking their partner to be quiet or to close the door to reduce the noise, they are asking if their partner can close the door to the outside world, as if that would somehow help the person concentrate better.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully pokes at the struggles of working from home. The person with the desk is clearly struggling to concentrate with the noise from the street, and yet, despite this, they are still more concerned with their partner disturbing them than the ambient noise.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="109.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="111.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
