On my desk at 3 P.M. sharp.</p><p style="text-align:center;font-size:16px">(hint: ghost stories are told around campfire, desk is campfire)</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is telling Jenkins, who is roasting marshmallows on the conference table, to write a ghost story. The joke is clever because the man is using the campfire setting to his advantage: usually, ghost stories are told around campfires, so by telling Jenkins to write a ghost story and have it on his desk, the man is effectively telling Jenkins to tell him a ghost story around the campfire (i.e. the burning conference table).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man implies that the desk is their campfire, and that he wants a ghost story from Jenkins. Telling ghost stories is often associated with camping activities around a real campfire, but the man's request to have a story delivered to his desk implies that the desk is their campfire.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Jenkins, who is presumably a subordinate in the company, has just been given a new task by his boss that is completely ridiculous. The boss wants a ghost story, but rather than telling it around the campfire, wants it delivered to his desk at 3 PM. This is absurd because it's not at all how ghost stories are typically transmitted.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is telling a story around a campfire, but the campfire is actually just his desk that's on fire. This implies that he's telling a ghost story, but the story is probably just made up and not actually based on a real ghost.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A campfire is often the setting for telling ghost stories, and the "desk" in this case is actually a campfire. The joke is that the executive is demanding a ghost story from his subordinate as if it's a business report, to be delivered at 3 P.M. sharp. The subordinate is being ordered to tell a story around the campfire, which is a fun activity, as if it's a mundane business task.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the campfire scene is a metaphor for the meeting that's happening around the "campfire." The joke is that the executive is treating the meeting like it's a casual get-together around a campfire, where people tell ghost stories. He's even asking for a ghost story from one of the attendees. This is a clever way to make a point about how unproductive and unprofessional the meeting is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in charge is clearly not paying attention to what is happening in the room --- the table is on fire and they are roasting marshmallows around it --- and is instead focused on his work. He is expecting a ghost story from one of his employees, not realizing that he is in the middle of one.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the tradition of telling ghost stories around a campfire. Here, the campfire is replaced with a desk, and the person telling the story is expected to have it ready by 3 P.M.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is ordering Jenkins, one of the other executives in the room, to write a ghost story. But, the speaker is doing so in a context where it's clear that there is no campfire, and the "ghost story" is just a metaphor for a work project. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the speaker is literally asking for a story about a ghost, but what they really mean is a work project related to the company.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the executives are treating their meeting room like it's a campfire, and so theboss is asking for a ghost story, which is a common type of story told around campfires. However, the joke is also funny because it's a double-meaning; the "desk" that the boss is referring to is actually the campfire itself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Jenkins, one of the people roasting marshmallows, is being asked to tell a ghost story around the campfire. The campfire in this case is the conference room table that is on fire, and the person asking for the story is his boss. The joke is funny because it's a play on the common scenario of telling ghost stories around a campfire.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the common activity of telling ghost stories around a campfire. The CEO is telling his employees to write a ghost story, but instead of a campfire, he wants it delivered to his desk, at 3 PM. The joke is made funnier by the fact that they are already sitting around a "campfire", roasting marshmallows over the burning end of the conference table.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is demanding that his subordinate, Jenkins, write a ghost story for him, and he is expecting it to be delivered to his desk at 3 PM sharp. This is silly because ghost stories are usually told around campfires, and the man's desk is currently serving as a campfire.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because ghost stories are typically told around a campfire, and the executive is asking for one to be delivered to his desk, which is currently on fire. The joke is a play on words, as the executive is literally asking for a story about a ghost to be delivered to his desk.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the scene in the meeting room is reminiscent of a campfire, with the executives roasting marshmallows on the burning table. The joke plays on the fact that ghost stories are often told around campfires, and the executive is expecting one of the employees to deliver a ghost story by 3 PM.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="107.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="109.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
