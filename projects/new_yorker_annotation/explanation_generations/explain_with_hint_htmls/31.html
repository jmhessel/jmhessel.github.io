Thus, the caveman's comment about the matinée being uncrowded is a non-sequitur.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cavemen are doing a fire juggling trick, which is something that is typically done in a circus or other entertainment setting. However, the cavemen are in a cave, which is not typically associated with entertainment venues like circuses. Furthermore, the fact that one of the cavemen says that he told the other one that the matinée wouldn't be crowded implies that fire juggling is a common enough happening that they have matinées for it, which is even more absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes the assumption that cavemen had matinées, which is a movie showing during the day that usually has discounted prices. Of course, cavemen didn't have movies, so the joke is clever because it playfully pokes at the idea that early civilizations were not as sophisticated as modern ones.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because cavemen, of course, did not have matinées, or any concept of movie theater showtimes. The caveman in this joke is juggling torches, which is a more modern trick, and the joke is that the other cavemen are unimpressed because they expected a more traditional caveman activity like, say, hunting or gathering.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The caveman who is juggling fire is saying that he told the other cavemen that the matinée wouldn't be crowded, meaning that not many people would be there to watch. However, the word "matinée" can also refer to a daytime performance, which cavemen would not have because they did not have electric lighting. Therefore, the joke is funny because it is a double meaning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is juggling fire, which is an impossible feat, and yet he makes a comment about how attendance is low as if it's a normal performance. This contrasts the expected low attendance at a fire-juggling show with the reality of the situation: that there is no one around to witness the impossible fire-juggling caveman.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "matinée" usually refers to a movie or a play that starts in the afternoon, but in this case, it is referring to the fire that the cavemen are sitting around. The fact that one of the cavemen is juggling torches is what makes the joke funny, because it is a reference to the fact that cavemen did not have matinées or movie theaters.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because cavemen would not have matinées, which are discounted afternoon movie showings. The joke is a play on words, as "matinée" can also refer to a morning performance, which cavemen also would not have. The joke would only make sense to someone who knows about both the meaning of "matinée" as an afternoon movie showing, and the fact that cavemen did not have such things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a matinée is usually a showing of a movie or theater performance that happens in the afternoon and typically has a lower attendance than the evening showings. However, because cavemen didn't have movies or theater performances, the speaker's comment that the matinée wouldn't be crowded is funny because there is no matinée to be crowded or not.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because cavemen wouldn't have matinées, which are special performances of shows that happen in the afternoon. The fact that the speaker said there wouldn't be many people at the matinée implies that he/she was expecting more people to watch the fire-juggling caveman, which is funnier because there's no one else around.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "matinée" is typically a movie or a play that starts earlier in the day, and thus has fewer people in attendance. But, in this case, the caveman is referring to the fact that there aren't many people around because they are in a cave. The wordplay is clever because it's unexpected, and also because it's a clever way to explain why there's no one else around to witness the caveman's juggling act.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is doing a modern day activity, juggling torches, in an ancient setting. The fact that he is joking about there being a matinée implies that he is aware that he is in a cave and that this is not a typical setting for a juggling performance. This joke would be funnier if it was told by a more modern day performer, such as a circus juggler.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "matinée" can refer to a showing of a movie or play that happens in the afternoon, and usually, these showings are not as crowded as the evening showings. However, since cavemen didn't have movies or plays, the joke is that the caveman is saying that he told the other cavemen that there wouldn't be a lot of people at the cave because it's not during the evening, when people are usually around the fire.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the fact that cavemen are often thought of as being uninterested in entertainment or art. The joke takes this one step further by suggesting that even if they were interested in entertainment, they would not have matinées, which are special performances typically during the daytime, because they would not have a concept of time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the cavemen are attending a movie, which is a modern invention. Furthermore, the fact that one caveman is juggling fire suggests that they are trying to entertain each other because the movie is not very good. The joke is clever because it pokes fun at both the invention of the movie and the practice of juggling fire.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="30.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="32.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
