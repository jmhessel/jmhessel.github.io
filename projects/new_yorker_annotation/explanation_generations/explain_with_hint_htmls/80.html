In a restaurant, when somebody's table is ready, it means that their food is ready and they can go sit down and eat.

In a restaurant, this phrase is used to tell a customer that their seat is ready and they can come and sit down. However, in this scene, the wise man is telling the explorer that only they will know when they are ready to achieve their goals. This is because the explorer is at the top of a mountain, which is a metaphor for the achievement of goals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Your table is ready" is something a host might say to a customer at a restaurant when their food is ready and their table is free. However, in this case, the monk is saying it to the mountain climber in a more spiritual way, implying that the mountain climber will only know when they are spiritually ready to "dine" or ascend the mountain. The joke is clever because it's a pun on a common phrase.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "your table is ready" is normally used to tell a customer that their seat at a restaurant is available. However, in this case, the phrase is being used to tell the explorer that their journey is finished and they have reached the top of the cliff. The explorer is the only one who knows when their table is ready, because they are the only one who knows when their journey is complete.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the explorer has just reached the top of a very tall mountain, and is now being told by the wise man that "only he will truly know when his table is ready." This is a play on words because, in a restaurant, "your table is ready" means that the explorer's food is finished and he can come eat it. However, in this case, the wise man is saying that the explorer will only know when he is spiritually ready to receive the wisdom he has to offer, which is a more profound and personal statement than the restaurant version.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words.

However, in this case, the wise man is saying that only the explorer will know when he is ready for the next stage in his life, similar to how a person only knows when their food is ready at a restaurant. The joke is clever because it takes a common phrase and gives it a new and deeper meaning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the fact that, when you're at a restaurant, you are typically assigned a table to sit at. However, the tables in this scene are on top of a cliff, which suggests that they are not meant for sitting at in the traditional sense. Rather, they are meant for contemplation and self-reflection. The joke is that, instead of being told by a host when your table is ready, you will only know when you are ready spiritually.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a regular restaurant, the host or hostess will usually tell you when your table is ready. However, in this case, the monk is telling the mountain climber that only he will know when his table is ready, in a more spiritual sense. The joke is clever because it's a play on words, and it's also a good observation about how people often seek spiritual guidance from monks.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The monk is saying that only the mountain climber will know when they are "ready" to eat, i.e., when they have achieved enlightenment/are spiritually ready. This is a different meaning of "ready" than the normal one, which would be when the food is served on the table. The joke is clever because it's a play on words that uses the double meaning of "ready" to create a pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words.

The explorer has just reached the "top" of the mountain, and the wise man tells him that only he will know when his "table is ready." This is a pun because the explorer has achieved a great physical feat in reaching the top of the mountain, but the wise man is suggesting that the explorer's true "table" is spiritual in nature.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words.
