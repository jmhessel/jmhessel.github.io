The fact that she's playing the guitar in the snow is a reference to how cold it is; in other words, it's so cold that even playing the guitar in the snow is too cold for the woman.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is playing music for her husband as he shovels snow, but dedicates a song to him that is critical of him. The lyrics of the song are funny because they are a biting criticism of the man for not taking his family to her parents' house in warmer Florida for winter instead of making them stay in the cold.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is playing a guitar and singing a song dedicated to her husband, who presumably is the one shoveling snow in the cold. The fact that she is dedicating a song to him in this situation implies that she is angry with him for not taking the family to her parents' house in Florida for the winter, where it would be warmer. The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that normally, songs dedicated to someone are love songs, but in this case, the song is dedicated to the husband out of anger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the wife is playing a guitar and dedicating a song to her husband, who presumably made the decision not to go to her in-laws' house in Florida for the winter. The fact that she is playing the guitar in the cold winter weather adds to the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is angry at her husband for not letting their family go to her parents' house in Florida for winter, where it's warmer. But, by dedicating a song to him, she's also indicating that she still loves him, even though she's mad. The word play here is that the word "timeshare" can mean both a physical location where people can go on vacation, as well as something that is shared between two people. In this case, the wife is angry because she wanted to share the experience of going to Florida with her husband and family, but he said no.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the word "timeshare." A timeshare is a vacation property that can be shared among a group of people, usually family or friends. In this case, the woman is angry at her husband for not letting their family go to her parents' house in Florida for the winter, where it's warmer. She refers to her parents' house as a "timeshare" because it's a shared vacation property. This is a play on words because a "time share" is also a property that can be shared among a group of people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the movie "The Shawshank Redemption", in which the main character is sent to prison and his wife decides to divorce him. In the movie, the wife is angry at him for not taking the family to her parents' house in Florida for the winter, where it's warmer. In this situation, the wife is angry at her husband for not taking the family to her in-laws' house in Florida for the winter, where it's warmer.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is playing the guitar and singing in the snow, and she dedicates the song to her husband who is shoveling the snow. The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that people often go to Florida to get away from the cold weather, but in this case, the man is stuck in the cold weather because his wife is making him stay home.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a dig at the man for not taking his family to Florida to visit her parents during winter, when it's warm. The wife is playing a guitar and singing a song dedicated to her husband, but the tone is sarcastic. The audience is meant to laugh at the husband for choosing to shovel snow in the cold instead of going to Florida.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is playing a guitar and singing a song for her husband as he shovels snow, but the song is actually a subtle jab at him for not taking their family to her parents' house in Florida for the winter. The wife is using the guitar and song as a guise of being sweet and loving, when really she's just trying to make her husband feel bad.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is playing a guitar and singing a song dedicated to her husband, who has decided not to take the family to her parents' house in Florida for winter. The fact that she is angry at him for not taking them to a warm place is ironic, given that she is outside in the cold playing a guitar.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the weather is so cold that the woman is angry at her husband for not taking the family to her parents' place in Florida, where it would be warm. The fact that it's a timeshare makes it even funnier, because it implies that the husband is cheap and doesn't want to spend the money, even though it would be well worth it to escape the cold weather.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is playing a guitar and singing a song for her husband as he shovels snow, which is a not-so-subtle way of telling him that she's mad. The fact that she's mad because he didn't take the family to her in-laws' house in Florida for the winter is a bit unusual, but it just adds to the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because shoveling snow is often seen as a arduous task that one has to do in the winter, particularly in colder climates. The fact that the woman is playing the guitar makes it seem like she is trying to serenade her husband as he works, which is a nice gesture. However, the joke is that the couple is presumably shoveling snow outside of their house in the cold, when they could be in Florida, where it is warmer. This is a poking fun at the fact that the husband chose not to go to his in-laws' timeshare in Florida, presumably because he doesn't like them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is playing the guitar in the snow, which is cold, and she dedicates a song to her husband who decided not to take the family to her parents house in Florida for winter, where it's warm. The contrast between the cold and the warm is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="79.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="81.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
