The phrase "happy hour" can refer to both the time of day when drinks are discounted at a bar, and the act of drinking alcohol. In this case, the trains are at the bar during happy hour, taking advantage of the discounts, but they are also happy because they are drunk. This play on words is unexpected and thus humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the stereotype that trains are always late. However, in this scenario, the trains are not only on time, but they are actually early for happy hour. This ironic twist is amusing because it's unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because although trains are often late in real life, they are shown as being on time for happy hour. This is a play on the fact that people often use the excuse of "the train was late" for being late to work or other obligations. In this case, the trains are actually being responsible by making it to happy hour on time!</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because trains are notoriously always late, except for when they are drinking at the bar. The joke plays on the common complaint about public transportation, but takes it to an extreme.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the stereotype that trains are always late. But, in this case, the trains are at the bar on time for happy hour, which is contrasting and unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is playing off the trope that trains are always late. However, in this scene, the two trains are actually at the bar on time for happy hour, which is surprising. The joke is a play on words because "happy hour" can mean either the discounts on drinks at a bar, or the time of day when the discounts are offered.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The trains are "subway trains," which is a type of rapid transit train. They are at the bar, which is a place where people go to drink alcohol, i.e., they are "subwaying" or "subwaying it up." This is a play on the fact that subway trains are notoriously always late.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the one time that subway trains are on time is when they are going to the bar. This is a play on the fact that trains are notoriously known for being late, except in this one instance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "happy hour" is usually used to describe a time at a bar when drinks are discounted, and so "they're never late for happy hour" means that the trains are always on time for when drinks are discounted. However, the word "late" can also mean "drunk," so the trains are actually always drunk. The fact that the trains are never late for happy hour is ironic because trains are usually notoriously late.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though trains are known for being late, in this scenario they are actually at the bar on time for happy hour. This is a play on words because "happy hour" can refer to a train's schedule (i.e., the time when the train is supposed to be running), or it can refer to a drinking event at a bar.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because trains are often running late, but in this scenario, the trains are exactly on time for happy hour. The fact that they are trains makes the joke even funnier, because it adds to the absurdity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "happy" can mean both "feeling good" and "a time of day." In this context, the trains are "happy" because they are at happy hour, which is a time of day when drinks are discounted at a bar. However, the fact that they are trains makes the joke funnier, because trains are notoriously always late.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="23.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="25.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
