The woman is looking at him and smiling, suggesting that she's okay with his baggage, literal and figurative. The joke is clever because it's a play on the common idiom "emotional baggage."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man at the bar is wearing a paper bag over his head, which is a literal representation of baggage. However, the woman he's staring at is probably smiling and having a good time because she doesn't have any emotional baggage, i.e., she's carefree. The man is saying that he needs someone without baggage, meaning he needs someone who is emotionally available and doesn't have any past baggage that would weigh them down.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is looking for a date without "baggage", but he has quite a bit of literal baggage in the form of the paper bag on his head. The woman he is staring at may or may not have emotional baggage, but she is certainly not burdened by a physical bag over her head.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man at the bar is literally wearing a paper bag over his head, while the woman is looking for someone without "baggage" (a metaphor for emotional/psychological baggage).

The woman is saying that she wants to date someone without "emotional baggage," i.e., someone who is emotionally available and doesn't have a lot of unresolved issues. However, the man she's with literally has a bag over his head, which could be interpreted as him having "baggage" in the sense that he's hiding something.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man at the bar is literally wearing a paper bag over his head, which is a sign that he is shy or does not want to be seen. However, the woman he is talking to is interpretting his words "without baggage" to mean that he is looking for a date who does not have emotional baggage from a previous relationship.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is worried about "baggage" in a relationship, but the woman he's with has an actual bag over her head.

The man at the bar is looking for someone without "baggage": typically, this means someone without emotional baggage, or drama in their life. However, the man at the bar has a literal bag over his head, implying that he has physical baggage that he's looking to get rid of.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has a literal paper bag over his head, but the woman's comment about wanting someone without baggage is usually meant figuratively, in the sense that she wants someone emotionally unavailable.

However, in this case, the man is literal baggage because he has a paper bag on his head.
