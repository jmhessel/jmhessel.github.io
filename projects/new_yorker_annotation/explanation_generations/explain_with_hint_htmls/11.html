The word "underwater" can mean either literally being under the water (like the chandelier), or it can mean being in a bad financial situation (like a hotel that is about to go bankrupt). In this joke, the man fishing catches a chandelier, which is a metaphor for a hotel that is financially insolvent (or "underwater").</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man caught a chandelier, which is an opulent, expensive item. The joke is made funnier by the fact that the man caught it while fishing, meaning that it likely came from a Trump hotel, which are known for their ostentatiousness. The joke could also be interpreted to mean that Trump hotels are "underwater" financially, meaning they are not doing well.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "underwater" can mean two things: 1) being physically under the water, as the chandelier is, or 2) being in debt, as the Trump hotel is. In this context, the joke is saying that the man must have caught the chandelier from a Trump hotel that is now "underwater" financially, meaning it is insolvent.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of the word "underwater". In this context, it can mean both literally being underwater (like the fish), or figuratively being underwater (like a hotel that is struggling financially). The joke is clever because it plays on the fact that Trump's hotels have been known to go bankrupt.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the chandelier being caught on the fishing rod is a reference to the Trump hotels that have been financial failures and have had to be sold underwater (for less than what is owed on them).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man caught a chandelier, which is an expensive item, on his fishing rod. The other man jokes that it must be from a Trump hotel, which is a play on the fact that many of Trump's businesses have gone bankrupt. The joke is clever because it can be interpreted in two ways: either the hotel is actually underwater or it is financially insolvent.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man has caught a chandelier, which one might find in an upscale hotel like a Trump hotel. However, the word "underwater" can also mean that something is financially insolvent or failing. In this case, the joke is implying that the Trump hotel is not doing well financially and is thus "underwater."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man has caught a chandelier, which could be interpreted to mean that he's caught something valuable.

The man has caught a chandelier, which one might find in an upscale hotel. But "underwater" can also mean that something is financially insolvent or struggling. In this case, the joke is implying that the Trump hotel chain is failing financially and that is why the chandelier is in the water: because the hotel is underwater financially.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "underwater" can mean two things: literally, meaning beneath the water, or figuratively, meaning in debt or insolvent. In this case, the joke is that the chandelier was caught in a Trump hotel, which is figuratively "underwater" because it is financially insolvent. The added layer of the chandelier being a literal object underwater makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man has caught a chandelier, which could be interpreted to mean that he's caught something expensive. However, the other man says that it's probably from a Trump hotel, which suggests that it's not as valuable as it appears to be. This is because Trump hotels are often financially insolvent, or "underwater."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man caught a chandelier, which is an opulent and expensive item, in his fishing net. This could be interpreted to mean that he literally caught it underwater, i.e., it came from a Trump hotel that is now underwater due to financial insolvency. Alternately, it could also mean that the man is a very successful fisherman, and he was able to catch such a valuable item because he knows where to fish.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="10.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="12.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
