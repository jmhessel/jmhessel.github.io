It just means there will be no heir.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually when an animal is spayed or neutered, it's for population control reasons or to keep them from reproducing; however, a cat who is royalty would not need to worry about population control, and therefore, the joke implies that the cat is being spayed or neutered for a different reason. In this case, it's because there won't be an heir, which is an issue for royalty.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is dressed like a king, implying that the cat is royalty. However, the fact that the cat has been spayed or neutered means that he can't reproduce, and thus there can be no heir to the throne. The joke is a play on words, as "heir" can also mean "one who inherits", as in, inherits the title of king.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's worried expression implies that she was concerned about the cat's ability to reproduce (and, by extension, continue the royal line). However, the cat can't reproduce because it has been spayed or neutered, as is common for household pets. The joke plays on the fact that even though the cat can't have kittens, it can still be considered royalty.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. When a cat is spayed or neutered, it means that they can't reproduce. Thus, the joke is saying that even though the cat is now crowned king, there will be no "heir" to the throne, because the cat can't have any children.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the idea of a "royal family": if a queen and king have no children, there is no "heir" to the throne. In this case, the cat has been "spayed or neutered" (an operation to prevent animals from reproducing), so there can never be any "kittens" or "offspring" from the cat, making the cat permanently a member of the "royal family".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: "heir" can refer to both a successor to a throne, and a child (or offspring) of a parent. In this context, the cat has been "spayed or neutered" (i.e. had surgery to prevent them from being able to reproduce), so there will be no "heir" in the sense of a successor to the throne (the cat is the king).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat has been spayed or neutered and thus can't have kittens. This makes the cat unable to produce an heir, which is necessary for royalty. The fact that the cat is still considered royalty despite this is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is obviously not going to produce offspring because it is either spayed or neutered. The woman in the couple is concerned because without an heir, they will no longer be royalty.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's concerned look implies that she was worried about the cat's health after learning that it had been spayed or neutered. However, the joke reassures her that just because the cat can't have kittens anymore, doesn't mean it won't still be considered royalty. The joke is also clever because "heir" can refer to both a direct descendant and something that is inherited, like a title or position.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. When a cat is spayed or neutered, they can't reproduce. So, the woman is worried that the cat won't be able to have kittens and be a "royal" family. However, the man reassures her that even though the cat can't have kittens, they will still be royalty.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. When a woman is pregnant, she is said to be "expecting an heir." In this case, the cat has just been spayed or neutered, so it can't reproduce, meaning there can't be any heirs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Heir" can mean both the person who will inherit the throne after the king dies, and it can also mean the reproductive cells that an animal has. Cats can't have heirs in either sense of the word if they are spayed or neutered, which is why the joke is funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully subverts the stereotype of a king or queen having an heir. In this case, the heir is not a person, but a cat, and because the cat has been spayed or neutered, it cannot have kittens, and thus cannot have an heir itself. The joke relies on the fact that "heir" can mean both a person who will inherit a title or property, as well as a animal who will have offspring.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is a "king" and kings usually have an heir. However, if the cat has been spayed or neutered, it can't have offspring, and therefore can't have an heir. The woman's concerned look implies that she's worried about this fact, and the joke is that even though the cat can't have an heir, it's still technically royalty.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is worried about the cat not being able to have kittens anymore after it is spayed or neutered. However, the cat will still be royalty, just without an heir.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="91.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="93.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
