No, I think it's a Gibson.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person says that the guitar the bird is playing is a Gibson, when in fact, it is a Martin. This is a play on words because Martin is both a type of bird and a type of guitar. This joke would be funnier if the person did not know that Martin was also a type of bird.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person on the ground is trying to figure out what kind of guitar the bird is playing. However, the bird is a Martin, which is both a type of guitar and a type of bird. The person on the ground is only considering guitar brands, and so doesn't realize that the bird is also a Martin.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person on the ground is trying to identify the type of guitar the bird is playing, and mistakes the bird's name (Martin) for the brand of guitar. This punchline challenges the assumption that the person on the ground knows more about guitars than the bird, which is of course absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The bird is playing a guitar, which is a Gibson guitar, but the speaker mistakes it for a Martin guitar. This is because "Martin" is both a type of bird and a type of guitar. The speaker is confusing the two because they look alike, but they are actually two different things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the monitoring birdwatchers are discussing the type of guitar the playing bird has, rather than the fact that he shouldn't be playing a guitar at all. This lack of focus on the anomaly at hand is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The bird is playing music on a guitar, and the guitar is a Martin. But the person observing the bird mistakes the guitar for a Gibson, which is another brand of guitar. This is humorous because it's a very specific mistake to make, and it's unlikely that the observer would be familiar enough with guitars to know the difference.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bird is playing a guitar, and the person observing it mistakes the brand of guitar for the bird species. In this case, the Martin guitar is a high-end, expensive brand, while the Gibson guitar is a more mid-range option: thus, the joke is that the person observing the bird is more concerned with the brand of guitar than the actual bird.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is an example of a pun. The man watching the bird thinks that the bird is playing a Gibson guitar, but the woman watching the bird thinks that the bird is playing a Martin guitar. The joke is funny because it is a play on words: the Martin guitar is also a type of bird.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the birdwatchers mistakes the bird playing the guitar for a different type of bird. This is a play on words, because Martin is both a common type of bird, and a brand of guitar. Gibson is also a brand of guitar. So, the birdwatcher is confusing the bird playing the guitar for a Gibson guitar, when it is actually a Martin bird.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person on the ground mistakes the bird for a Martin guitar, when in fact it is a Gibson. The joke is clever because "Martin" is both a type of bird and a type of guitar.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the birdwatchers are trying to figure out what kind of guitar the bird is playing, not realizing that the bird itself is an instrument. The fact that they mistake the bird for a guitar is ironic because it's the exact opposite of what is happening.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The bird is playing a guitar, and one of the people watching it comments on the make of the guitar. However, they mix up the two brands of guitars, making a Martin guitar into a Martin bird. This is amusing because it is an unlikely mistake to make.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The person watching the bird playing the guitar is remarking on what kind of guitar it is, and says that it's a Martin. However, Martin is both a type of bird and a type of guitar, so the person could also be remarking on the type of bird it is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The bird is playing a Martin guitar, but the birdwatcher comments that it looks like a Gibson guitar instead. This is funny because it's a pun: the bird is a Martin, but it's also playing a Martin guitar.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people on the ground are talking about the brand of guitar the bird is playing, with one person guessing "Martin." But, "Martin" is both a type of bird and a type of guitar, so the joke is that the person confused the two. Similarly, the brand "Gibson" is just a type of guitar, so the person is saying that the bird is playing a Gibson guitar.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="91.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="93.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
