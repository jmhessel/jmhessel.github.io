The fact that the man in the tree is being offered a worm by a bird implies that he is in a precarious position and might be hungry, but he is still unwilling to eat the worm.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "I only eat them on Tuesdays." The person in the tree is saying that they don't want to eat worms, in the same way that someone might say they only eat certain foods on certain days of the week. However, the fact that they clarified that they only eat worms on reality TV shows implies that they think eating worms is a disgusting and extreme activity that is only done for entertainment value.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the TV show Fear Factor, where contestants have to eat disgusting things like worms. Most people would never eat worms, but on Fear Factor, it's a challenge that people do for fun/money. In this joke, the man in the tree is offered a worm by the huge bird, but he turns it down because he only eats worms on TV, i.e., not in real life.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the tree is saying that he doesn't want to eat the worm because he only eats them when he's on a reality TV show like Fear Factor, where people do gross things for money. However, the word "reality" can also refer to the actual, real world, as opposed to a TV show. So, the man in the tree is saying that he only eats worms in the real world, i.e., he's a real-life worm-eater.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "I only eat them on reality shows" can mean two things: either that the person only eats worms when they are on a reality TV show (e.g., Fear Factor), or that the person only eats worms that are shown on reality TV (i.e., they are not real). In this case, the man in the tree is saying that he only eats worms that are part of a reality TV show, which is a play on the fact that many people consider worms to be disgusting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "there's no such thing as a free lunch." The bird is offering the man a worm to eat, which would be a free lunch for the man. However, the man politely declines because he only eats worms as part of a challenge on a reality TV show, where contestants often have to do gross things for money. In other words, the man would only accept the bird's offer if there was something in it for him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is saying that he only eats worms on reality TV shows --- in other words, he's not actually going to eat the worm, even though it's a real worm in a real tree. The contrast between the man's potential fear of eating a worm and the reality TV context in which he would do it makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because birds typically eat worms, but humans usually don't. The fact that the man is sitting in a tree next to a bird with a worm adds another level of absurdity to the joke. The joke is also a play on the fact that some reality TV shows, like Fear Factor, challenge participants to eat unusual things like worms.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common misconception that worms are only eaten by people on reality TV shows like Fear Factor, when in fact, people eat worms all the time (e.g., in sushi). The man in the tree is offered a worm by the bird, but he politely declines because he only eats them for entertainment value, not as a meal.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="38.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="40.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
