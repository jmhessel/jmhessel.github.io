In this case, the native americans have re-purposed traditionally western technology like rockets against the settlers. The irony is that the native americans are using technology that is more advanced than what the settlers have, which is funny because it the settlers are supposed to be more technologically advanced.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that native americans are more in touch with nature, and therefore use simple technology like bows and arrows. However, in this case, the native americans have re-purposed western technology, like rockets, against the settlers. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the stereotype that native americans have lower levels of education; in this case, the medicine man went to M.I.T., one of the most prestigious universities in the world.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype of native americans being "close to nature." The native americans in the joke are using western technology against the settlers, which is the opposite of what one would expect.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it subverts the stereotype of native Americans being closer to nature and not as technologically advanced as settlers from Europe. In this case, the native Americans have gone to M.I.T. (an elite university known for its science and engineering programs) to learn how to make a missile, and are using it against the settlers in a traditional Native American way: by using it as an arrowhead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it portrays the native americans as using western technology against the settlers. In this case, the technology is a rocket, which is a highly advanced weapon, against the settlers in the fort. The joke is funnier because it is unexpected: one would not expect the technologically-backward native americans to have rockets, let alone use them against the settlers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype of Native Americans being "closer to nature." In this case, the Native Americans have been able to created a rocket, which is a very high-tech weapon, by re-purposing western technology. The joke is clever because it both subverts the stereotype and highlights the Native Americans' resourcefulness.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at both the stereotype of the uneducated native american, as well as the assumption that all western technology is superior to anything created by indigenous people. The joke implies that the native americans are using a rocket, which is a very advanced piece of technology, against the american settlers in the fort. This is made funnier by the contrast between the high-tech missile and the traditional image of the native american with a bow and arrow.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's poking fun at the stereotype of Native Americans being "closer to nature" and not as technologically advanced as white settlers. In this joke, the Native Americans have re-purposed traditionally western technology, like rockets, against the settlers. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the acronym M.I.T., which stands for Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a well-known university.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the use of technologically advanced weapons by Native Americans against settlers. In this case, the joke is specifically about a rocket, which is a very advanced type of weapon. The joke is made funnier by the fact that the rocket was made by the Native Americans' medicine man, who presumably doesn't have any formal training in rocket science.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it comments on the paradox of the native americans being displaced by settlers/colonizers, while at the same time, making use of the same technology ( rockets) that allow the settlers to come in the first place. The joke is also clever because it playfully swaps out the traditional "arrowhead" for a missile, which is a type of rocket.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words and stereotypes. A "medicine man" is a shaman or healer in many indigenous cultures. In this joke, the medicine man has gone to M.I.T. (the Massachusetts Institute of Technology), a renowned university in the USA known for its science and engineering programs. The joke is clever because it's a play on the stereotype of indigenous people being "close to nature" and not having access to or understanding of advanced technology; by having the medicine man go to M.I.T., it upends that stereotype.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reversal of the stereotype that native americans are closer to nature, and instead, are using high-tech weapons against the settlers. The fact that the medicine man went to M.I.T. (a highly reputable science and engineering school) for the express purpose of learning how to make missiles is also amusing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a reference to the stereotype that Native Americans are "closer to nature" than other Americans. In this instance, the Native Americans have taken a traditionally Western object, the rocket, and are using it against the settlers in their fort. The joke is clever because it uses the stereotype to make a point about the resourcefulness of Native Americans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokesfun at the stereotype of Native Americans as "noble savages" who are in touch with nature. The fact that their medicine man went to M.I.T. (a highly prestigious university known for its science and engineering programs) and is using a rocket points to the contrary: Native Americans are just as technologically savvy as anyone else. The joke is also funny because it imagines a re-purposing of traditionally western technology against the settlers, which is a clever inversion.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the high-tech missile and the traditional image of native americans. The native americans in the joke are using technology usually associated with the west (i.e., the settlers) against them. The fact that their medicine man went to M.I.T. (a highly prestigious university in the USA) adds to the joke by suggesting that the native americans are not only using western technology, but are also more educated than the settlers.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="38.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="40.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
