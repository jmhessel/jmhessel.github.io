Try reasoning with him.</p><p style="text-align:center;font-size:16px">(hint: whales are smart but not smart enough to converse with)</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is playing on the stereotype that whales are very intelligent animals. While they are indeed smart, the husband in the joke is suggesting that the wife try to have a conversation with the whale blocking their way, which is impossible because whales can't talk. The joke is funny because it is a play on the idea that communication is key to resolving conflict, but in this case, it is impossible.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is based on the false assumption that the whale is acting intentionally to block the couple's way. The woman's suggestion to try reasoning with the whale implies that she believes the whale is capable of understanding and responding to human language, when in reality, this is not the case. The joke works because it is a play on the common misconception that all animals, especially large mammals like whales, are much more intelligent than they actually are.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common perception that whales are very intelligent animals. The woman in the boat suggests reasoning with the whale as if it is a child or a pet, not realizing that whales (despite being intelligent) cannot understand human language.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while whales are indeed very intelligent animals, they aren't capable of rational thought or communication like humans are. The woman in the rowboat is asking her husband to try reasoning with the whale as if it were a person, when in reality, the whale is just an animal following its instinct.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is suggesting that her husband try to talk to the whale, as if it is a person. This is absurd because, although whales are considered to be intelligent animals, they cannot communicate with humans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is absurd to try and talk to a whale in order to get it to move out of the way: the woman is suggesting something that is impossible/irrational in order to achieve their goal. The joke also pokes fun at the idea that whales are "intelligent" animals: while they may be smart in some ways, they are not smart enough to have a conversation with humans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the discrepancy between how intelligent whales are (they are very intelligent animals) and the impossibility of actually communicating with them. The woman in the rowboat is trying to reason with the whale, even though it's clear that the whale doesn't understand her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because whales are often thought of as being very intelligent animals, but in this case, the woman is suggesting that her husband try to reason with the whale blocking their way. The joke is clever because, even though whales are intelligent, they obviously can't reason or hold a conversation with humans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the woman in the boat suggests reasoning with the whale, which is funny because it's not something one would usually try to do, and also because whales are famous for being intelligent animals. However, the woman's use of the word "reasoning" is also a play on the word "reason", as in, "the reason the whale is blocking our way is because he is trying to stop us from getting to shore."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's an example of humans underestimating an animal's intelligence. Sure, the whale is huge and blocking their way, but the woman suggests that her husband try reasoning with the whale, as if the whale is a small child or a pet who might be persuaded to move. The joke is funnier because, of course, whales are not known for their ability to hold a conversation, so the woman's suggestion is completely misguided.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is telling her husband to try to reason with the whale, as if it's a person who can understand them. The joke is funny because, of course, whales are very intelligent animals, but they cannot understand human language.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is absurd to try and converse with a whale, even though they are large and intelligent animals. The joke implies that the woman is so intelligent that she thinks she can reason with the whale, even though it is clear that the whale is not trying to reason with them and is just blocking their way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a common misconception that whales are very intelligent animals. While they are indeed intelligent, they are not so intelligent that they can reason or have a conversation with humans. The joke is funny because the woman is telling her husband to try to have a conversation with the whale in order to get past it, which is clearly not going to work.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is sarcastic: the woman is trying to reason with the whale as if it is a person, when in reality, the whale is just an animal and so cannot understand or respond to her. The joke is clever because whales are actually considered to be very intelligent animals, but they are not at the level of humans in terms of intelligence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is true that whales are very intelligent, but the idea of reasoning with one, or expecting it to understand human language, is absurd. The speaker in the joke is acting as if the whale is just being difficult and not understanding them, when in reality, it's impossible for the whale to understand them. The joke is a play on the whale's intelligence: while it may be high for an animal, it's still far below that of a human.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="18.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="20.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
