This is, of course, not the reason why her patient feels that way, but it is a amusing misunderstanding.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Linda, a woman, is literally beneath the two men in the therapy session. This is a reversal of the common phrase "beneath you", which is used to say that someone is figuratively inferior to another person. In this case, the practical consequence of the reversed phrase is that Linda is physically unable to look the men in the eye, which is an obstacle to effective communication.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in this context, "beneath" has a double meaning: first, Linda is on the top bunk, so men are literally beneath her. Second, the term "beneath" can also mean that something is not good enough or not as good as something else, which in this context would mean that Linda thinks men are not as good as women. Thus, the joke is funny because it is a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Linda is literally on the bottom bunk, and so men are "beneath" her in a literal sense. This joke plays on the double-meaning of the word "beneath" --- below in a figurative sense, as in men are not as good as women, and below in a literal sense, as in they are lower in social status or physically lower.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The triple-tiered therapy couch suggests that the three people being counseled are literally beneath the woman therapist, when in fact, they are figuratively beneath her. The woman therapist is asking a question about why the person (Linda) thinks men are beneath her, but the question can be interpreted in two ways: figuratively, asking why Linda thinks men are inferior to her, or literally, asking why Linda think men are below her on the therapy couch.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the word "beneath" can have two meanings: figuratively, it can mean that someone is not as good as another person, and literally, it can mean that someone is below them in terms of physical location. In this context, the therapist is asking the patient why she thinks men are figuratively beneath her, but the fact that she is literally beneath two men on a bunk bed makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman on the top bunk is talking about how she feels men are "beneath" her, when in actuality they are literally beneath her on the bunk bed. This plays off the idea that women sometimes feel that men are not as good as them, when in actuality they might be better than them in some ways.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in this therapy session, the patients are all on a bunk bed, with the woman in the middle. This means that the men are literally beneath her, rather than figuratively. The joke plays on the idea that men are often seen as being inferior to women, but takes it to an extreme by making it literal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is asking a patient why she thinks men are figuratively beneath her, when in fact they are literally beneath her, because they are on a lower bunk bed. This is a play on words, as the therapist is asking a deep question that Linda may not have considered, but the joke is that the answer is actually quite literal and trivial.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The patient, Linda, is saying that she thinks men are beneath her, meaning that she thinks they are inferior to her. However, the therapist interprets this to mean that she literally thinks men are beneath her, as in, they are below her on the bunk bed. The irony is that the therapist is missing the point of what Linda is saying, and is instead focusing on a literal interpretation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman in the therapy session is talking about how she feels like men are beneath her, but in this context, it's literal: there are two men under her in the bunk bed. The therapist is trying to get her to explore her feelings about men, but the joke is that she is so used to thinking of men being beneath her that she doesn't even realize that she's literalizing it in this context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Linda is stacked in a bunk bed with two other patients, and so the therapist's question about why she thinks men are beneath her takes on a literal meaning. In addition, the joke is clever because it is a play on words: Linda is not just stacked beneath two other women in the bunk bed, but she also figuratively considers men to be beneath her in terms of power and status.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Beneath" can mean both "lower in rank" and "below physically". In this case, the therapist is asking the woman why she thinks men are "lower in rank" when they are literally below her on the three-tiered couch.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Linda, the patient, is on the bottom bunk of the bunk bed, and thus literally beneath the two men who are on the top bunk. This plays off the common idiom "beneath you," meaning that someone is not worthy of your time or attention. In this case, Linda is taking the idiom literally, to mean that men are literally beneath her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Linda's position on the bottom bunk implies that she literally views men as being beneath her. However, the question from the therapist also has a figurative meaning, in that Linda might think less of men, or see them as being inferior to her in some way. The double meaning is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="49.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="51.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
