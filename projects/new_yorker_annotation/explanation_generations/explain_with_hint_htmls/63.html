Drive to the store and get me more beer.</p><p style="text-align:center;font-size:16px">(hint: woman teaching cat math, all man wants is beer from dog)</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idea that, when two people (usually a man and a woman) are having a discussion and one person is trying to impress the other with their knowledge, the other person is usually not very interested and is more focused on something else entirely. In this case, the man is unimpressed by the woman's display of knowledge, and all he wants is for the dog to go get him more beer.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that the woman is teaching the cat math, which is something that is far beyond most people's understanding. The man's comment about just wanting beer from the dog implies that he doesn't care about the woman's impressive feat, he just wants something that is more simple and within his grasp.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is more interested in getting beer from the dog than he is in the woman's impressive display of teaching the cat mathematics. The joke is also funny because it is an example of anthropomorphism --- the dog is depicted as if it can drive a car and go to the store to get beer.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is trying to impress the man by doing something difficult (teaching the cat math), while all the man wants is something very simple (beer from the dog). The joke is a play on the stereotype that men are simple-minded and easy to please.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is doing something that is seen as difficult/academic (advanced mathematics), while the man is doing something that is seen as simple/mundane (going to the store for beer). This is funny because it is a reversal of expectations; typically, it is the man who is doing complex things and the woman who is doing simple things. In this case, the man just wants the dog to go to the store and get him beer, while the cat is doing something much more difficult.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common trope of women being better at math than men. The woman in the scene is not only better at math than the man, she is teaching an advanced math class to a cat, who presumably can't even understand the concepts. The man, meanwhile, is just sitting at the table with the dog, who brings him beer. This implies that the man is not only not as good at math as the woman, he is also not as smart as the dog.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is trying to show off her intelligence by teaching the cat advanced mathematics, while the man is much more interested in beer. The fact that the dog is going to the store to get beer for the man also adds to the humor because it implies that the dog is better at fetching things than the man is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is trying to impress the man with her intelligence by teaching the cat advanced mathematics. However, the man is not impressed, and simply wants the dog to go to the store and get him more beer. This is funny because it's a reversal of the expected roles: the dog is typically smart and the cat is typically not, but in this case, it's the opposite.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is doing something that is supposed to be very impressive --- teaching a cat advanced mathematics --- while the man is unimpressed and just wants the dog to go get him more beer. This is funny because it's unexpected: usually it's the man who is unimpressed by the woman, not the other way around.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is teaching the cat "advanced mathematics", but what the man really wants is for the dog to go get him "more beer". In other words, the man is more interested in the dog fetching him beer than he is in the woman's intellectual pursuits.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the break room wants the woman to "impress" him by going to the store to get him more beer. However, the fact that she is "impressing" him by teaching the cat math implies that he is not impressed by her intelligence or her abilities.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is teaching the cat math, which is impressive, but the man doesn't care about that --- he just wants the dog to go get him more beer. The word "impressive" is also a pun in this context, because it can be used to describe something that is pleasing to look at (i.e., the woman is impressive to look at) as well as something that is notable or worthy of admiration (i.e., the woman's math skills are impressive).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is more concerned with getting beer from the dog than he is with the woman's impressive feat of teaching the cat advanced mathematics. The joke is also funny because it implies that the man is not as smart as the cat or the woman.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the stereotype that men are simple-minded and only want beer. In this situation, the man is sitting at a table while the woman is doing something impressive (teaching a cat advanced mathematics), yet all he can think about is beer. The joke is made even funnier by the fact that the dog, which is usually associated with being loyal and obedient, is the one who would have to go get the beer for the man.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the woman who is trying to impress the man by teaching the cat advanced mathematics, and the man who is unimpressed and only wants beer. It's also funny because it's anthropomorphizing the dog --- instead of the dog being a loyal friend who gets the beer for the man, the dog is now a servant who is expected to go get the beer for the man.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="62.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="64.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
