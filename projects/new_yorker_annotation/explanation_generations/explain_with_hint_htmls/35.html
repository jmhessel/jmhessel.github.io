The therapist is acknowledging that the banana peel is right --- some of us do bruise easier than others. However, she is referring to literal bruising, as in, when fruit bruises, versus emotional bruising. The contrast is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "bruises" can either refer to physical marks on bananas from being dropped or squished, or emotional marks from being hurt. In this case, the therapist is pretending that the banana peel is a human client who is telling her about emotional bruises, even though the bruises are literally just from being squished.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "bruising" has a double meaning: it can refer to physical bruising, as in when a fruit gets a bruise, but it can also refer to emotional bruising. In this context, the therapist is acknowledging that the banana peel is right --- some of us do bruise easier than others, emotionally.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The therapist is trying to sympathetically agree with the banana peel, but the only thing she can think to say is that some of us bruise more easily than others. However, the word "bruise" can mean both a physical mark on the skin and emotional trauma. So, the therapist is inadvertently saying that the banana peel is emotionally fragile.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is taking the banana peel's "problems" seriously, even though it's just a fruit. The therapist is probably trying to be comforting by saying that everyone bruises differently, but the fact that she's saying it to a banana peel makes it humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is talking to the banana peel as if it is a human patient. She says that some of us (humans) bruise easier than others, but since the banana peel is not human, it literal bruises instead of emotional bruising. The therapist's misunderstanding is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a therapist would not normally see a banana peel as a patient. The therapist is making a joke about how some people "bruise easier than others" meaning that some people are more emotionally fragile/sensitive than others. However, in this case, the therapist is literally talking about a fruit that bruises easily.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is trying to console the banana peel, which has been bruised (likely from someone stepping on it), by saying that some people bruise more easily than others. However, the banana peel is not a person, so the therapist's words are actually true in a literal sense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is taking the banana peel's "complaint" seriously. The therapist is equating the banana peel's bruising to emotional bruising, which is a surprising and humorous comparison.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="34.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="36.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
