In this case, "directions" can mean both driving directions (i.e., how to get to the destination/goal), and directions for being a good lover. The latter meaning is more relevant in this context, given the bed and the post-sex conversation, and is suggested by the woman's tone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman in the bed is asking her partner for directions, but she could be talking about two different things: literal driving directions, or directions for how to please her sexually. The fact that the bed is shaped like a car adds to the joke, because it suggests that the man is not very good at giving directions, whether they be for driving or for sex.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "directions" can mean either literal driving directions or figurative directions on how to please a partner during sex. The fact that the couple is in a race car bed, which is usually for children, and they look like they just had sex, implies that they need directions on how to have better sex.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the man is clearly not good at giving directions when driving (as evidenced by the fact that they're in a toddler's bed), he's also not good at giving directions for being a good lover. The joke is a play on the phrase "would it kill you to," which is often used when someone is asking for something that isn't difficult to do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman in the bed is asking the man for directions, but she could be asking for driving directions, or she could be asking for directions in terms of how to be a good lover. The fact that the bed is shaped like a race car suggests that the man is not very good at giving directions, which is why the woman is asking for them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is pun on the phrase "Would it kill you to ____?", which is often used to begged someone to do something that isn't difficult or onerous. In this case, the speaker is asking the man to be a better lover, rather than simply asking for directions to get somewhere. The joke is clever because it's a play on words, but it is also subtly critical of the man's performance in bed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The speaker is asking if it would kill the man to ask for "driving directions." This is a polite way of asking if the man is lost, which would explain why they are in a child's racecar bed. However, the word "directions" can also be a metaphor for instructions on how to be a good lover. In this context, the speaker is asking if it would kill the man to ask for advice on how to please her sexually.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Asking for directions" can mean either literally asking for directions to some destination, or figuratively asking for advice on how to improve one's love life. In this case, the latter meaning is implied, as the couple is in a racecar-shaped bed. The joke is clever because it's wordplay that is also relevant to the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the woman is asking her partner to give her directions, but instead of directions to get somewhere, she wants him to give her directions on how to have sex. This is funny because it's unexpected: usually, it's the man who wants directions on how to please his partner, not the other way around.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is asking her partner for "driving directions" during sex, which implies that he is not good at sex and she wants him to be more assertive and take charge. However, the fact that they are in a race car bed makes the joke funnier, because it's not usually expected that adults would need "driving directions" for sex, since they should already know how to do it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, after having sex in a racecar bed, the woman is asking the man for directions, presumably to their next destination. However, the man could interpret this as a criticism of his performance during sex, implying that she didn't have a good time, and thus he didn't do his job properly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is implying that his wife is a terrible driver, by extension meaning that she is also a terrible lover. This is because the woman is not following "directions" in the bedroom, meaning she is not doing what he wants her to do. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words, with the man asking for "driving directions" to mean that his wife should be more considerate and attentive in bed.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="43.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="45.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
