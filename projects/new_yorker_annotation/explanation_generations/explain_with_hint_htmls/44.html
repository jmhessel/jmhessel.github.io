The joke is suggesting that the lizard's problem isn't that he can't draw a picture, it's that he can't come up with a clever enough caption for it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The caveman is saying that drawing the cartoon is the easy part, it's the caption that's tough. This is a reference to the New Yorker caption contest, where people submit captions for pre-made cartoons. The joke is clever because it is true that the captions are usually harder to come up with than the actual drawing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dinosaur is doing something that he's not supposed to be able to do: drawing. The joke is also a reference to the New Yorker cartoon caption contest, which is popular among readers of the magazine; the contest is based on the premise that the cartoon is the easy part, and that the real challenge is coming up with a clever caption.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. In the context of the situation, the speaker is saying that the reptile's drawing is good, but it's the caption that is difficult. In other words, the reptile has drawn a good cartoon, but it's the accompanying text that is tough. However, the joke could also be interpreted to mean that the reptile is good at drawing pictures (of cavemen), but it's the writing of the captions that is difficult. This is a reference to the New Yorker's weekly caption contest, which is a contest to see who can write the best caption for a given cartoon.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is trying to come up with a clever caption for his drawing, but is having trouble. This is a play on the common joke format where someone says something that could be interpreted multiple ways, and the second person says the more clever interpretation. In this case, the caveman is trying to be clever with his drawing, but is failing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lizard is trying to draw a picture, but is having trouble coming up with a caption. This is a common problem for people who submit cartoons to the New Yorker, as the cartoon caption contest is notoriously difficult. The fact that the lizard is struggling with this task is ironic, as it is usually considered much easier to come up with a caption than it is to draw a whole cartoon.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common New Yorker cartoon caption contest, in which the reader submits a caption for a cartoon that has yet to be published. In this instance, the joke is that the dinosaur's drawings are so good that they don't need a caption, because the image is already clear. This is clever because it's a reversal of the common situation, in which a cartoon needs a caption to be clear.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. Normally, people say "It's not the destination, it's the journey" to mean that the process of getting somewhere is more important than the end result. In this case, the lizard is trying to communicate something through his drawing, but the cavemen don't understand because they can't read the caption. The joke is that the cartoonist didn't put much effort into the drawing, but the caption is the most important part.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the New Yorker cartoon caption contest, where people submit captions for a cartoon. The joke is that the dinosaur is having trouble coming up with a caption for his drawing, indicating that creating the cartoon is the easy part, and coming up with the clever caption is the difficult part.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. A "hieroglyph" is both an ancient form of writing and a type of picture. In the context of thescene, the reptile has created a drawing, but the drawing is just a bunch of simple shapes. The joke is that the real challenge isn't drawing the scene, it's coming up with an clever caption for the drawing. This is a reference to the New Yorker cartoon caption contest, which is a contest where people submit captions for cartoons.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "caption" can refer to the title or explanation of a cartoon, but it can also refer to something that is underneath an image. In this case, the lizard is "captioning" his drawing with actual words, which is much harder than just drawing the image.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The first part of the joke is about the lizard trying to draw a picture on the cave wall. The second part is about the New Yorker cartoon caption contest, which is a contest where people have to write a caption for a cartoon. The joke is that the cartoon is the easy part, and it's the caption that's tough.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is saying that it is easy to draw the pictures, but it is hard to come up with a caption for them. This is a play on the common misconception that the cartoonist only has to worry about the drawing, when in reality, the caption is just as important.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "caption" can mean two things: a short description of a photo or graphic, or the text under a cartoon. In this case, the man is saying that it's easy to draw the pictures, but it's the text that's hard. This is a common challenge for cartoonists, as they have to come up with both the image and the text.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. In the New Yorker magazine, there is a cartoon caption contest where readers submit captions for a cartoon that is published in the magazine. The joke is that the caveman is saying that it is easy to draw the cartoon, but it is the caption that is hard. However, since the reptile cannot actually write, the caveman is technically correct: the reptile could not have written the caption, even if it was easy to draw the cartoon.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="43.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="45.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
