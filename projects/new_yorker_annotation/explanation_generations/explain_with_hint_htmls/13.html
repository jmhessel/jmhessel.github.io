The pitchfork is a symbol of the devil, which is ironic because it's usually used to poke people in hell. Furthermore, the joke is clever because it's a play on words --- the phrase "moving the pitchfork" can mean either adjusting the position of the pitchfork, or having sex (which is often associated with fire).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it puns on the fact that a pitchfork, a common instrument of torture in Hell, is also a type of antenna. The idea of the devil having to adjust his pitchfork to get better reception is amusing because it's a silly, mundane task that is incongruous with the image of Hell as a dark, harrowing place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in order to get better reception on a television, you would typically adjust the antenna. However, in this case, the antenna is a pitchfork that the devil is holding, which is funny because it's a symbol of torture. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the phrase "moving the goalposts," which means to change the rules of the game in order to make it harder for someone to succeed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "moving the pitchfork a little left" can mean either adjusting a pitchfork so that it's pointing slightly to the left, or adjusting an antenna on a television so that the picture is clearer. In this case, the pitchfork is being used as an antenna for the television, which is showing fire instead of the traditional programming one might expect to find in Hell.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the typical connotation of a pitchfork is as a tool used by farmers to move hay, but in this case, the pitchfork is being used as an antenna for the TV. The fact that the people in Hell are naked and watching TV is also ironic, as TV is often seen as a mind-numbing form of entertainment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "pitchfork" can refer to a tool used for farming, or it can be a type of trident carried by the devil in many depictions. Here, the pitchfork is serving a dual purpose: it is both a tool used to farm and an antenna to get better reception on the TV. The irony is that in Hell, there is likely nothing worth watching on TV, no matter how good the reception is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in order to get better television reception, one would usually adjust an antenna, not a pitchfork. However, in this context, the pitchfork is acting as an antenna, which is why the man is suggesting that the demon move it. The joke is clever because it takes a familiar situation (trying to get better reception on a television) and changes a small detail (the antenna) to make it humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the pitchfork, which is commonly associated with the Devil, is being used as an antenna for a television. In this context, it's humorous because it's unexpected and nonsensical.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="12.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="14.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
