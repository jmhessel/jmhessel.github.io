The husband is sitting on the wall because they don't share the same bed, as evidenced by the fact that they are sitting in different parts of the room. The joke implies that the reason they don't share the same bed is because they are physically unable to due to the gravitational misalignment, which is a result of their divorce.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is obviously not together anymore if they can't even share the same bed. The joke is made funnier by the fact that the reason they can't share a bed is because of the unusual situation in the room: the walls are defying gravity, so presumably the beds would be as well. This would make it very difficult to sleep in the same bed as your partner!</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men presumably are in a counseling session together with the woman, who is either their shared wife or girlfriend. It's a play on words because in this context, "bed" isn't just a furniture piece where you sleep, but it can also refer to a sexual relationship. The man on the side of the wall presumably doesn't share a bed with the woman because of the alignment of their bodies with gravity, which would make it uncomfortable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the reasons for divorce are usually things like infidelity or incompatibility, but in this case, the couple is divorcing because they can't physically share the same bed: the man is stuck to the wall. The joke is funny because it's a ridiculous reason for divorce, and because it's a play on the fact that "gravity" is often cited as a reason why couples stay together.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a normal scenario, it would be assumed that two people who are married would share a bed. However, the fact that the chair is stuck to the wall indicates that there is some sort of gravity misalignment in the room, which would make it difficult to share a bed. Thus, the counselor is making a joke about the fact that the couple doesn't share a bed because of the gravity situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The fact that the chair is stuck to the wall suggests that the couple has some type of marital conflict that has led to them sleeping in separate beds. The joke is that the woman is interviewing for a job in a counselor's office, which suggests that she is trained in marriage counseling, but the joke is that she can't even fix her own marriage.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a normal divorce situation, people often don't want to share a bed because they are no longer intimate/interested in each other. However, in this situation, the reason they don't share a bed is because the man is floating on the wall, meaning that their beds would be physically misaligned if they tried to share one. The joke is clever because it's a play on the common divorce reason, but with a more literal meaning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is sitting at a desk with her arms crossed, which is a common body language barrier, symbolizing that she is closed off. The man is literally on the other side of the room on the wall, which also symbolizes a barrier. In this case, the barrier is physical, and the joke is that they don't share the same bed because of the gravity misalignment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman presumablyisharing a bed with the man she is talking to in therapy, given that they are discussing their marital problems. However, the other man in the room, who is sitting on the side of the wall, is not part of their relationship. This defies the laws of gravity, which would dictate that he would fall off the wall. The joke is clever because it uses the unusual situation to make a pun about the man not sharing a bed with the woman.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the husband and wife are sitting on opposite sides of the room, which would make it difficult to share a bed. The joke is even funnier because the reason they can't share a bed is because of the unusual situation of gravity being reversed in one half of the room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The interviewee has said that she and her husband don't share the same bed, to which the interviewer replies that he takes it she doesn't share the same bed. The joke is clever because "take it" can mean both to understand something and to take something literally. In this case, the interviewer has taken the woman's words literally to mean that she and her husband don't share the same bed because they are not aligned with each other due to gravity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the counseling session doesn't share the same bed with his wife because they are going through a divorce, which is a very common reason for couples to stop sharing a bed. However, the counselee also says that the reason they don't share the bed is because of a "gravity misalignment." This could be interpreted to mean that the reason they don't share the bed is because they are not attracted to each other anymore, which is another common reason for divorce. The joke is funny because it takes a mundane reason for divorce and adds a layer of absurdity to it.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="95.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="97.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
