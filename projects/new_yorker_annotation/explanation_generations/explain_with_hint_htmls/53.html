The landlord is watching the current tenant drown in quicksand, and he's making small talk with the future tenant about how the apartment will be available soon. He doesn't seem to care that the current tenant is in peril, and he's just focused on renting out the apartment as soon as possible. This is a commentary on how some landlords only care about their bottom line, and they aren't concerned with the well-being of their tenants.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's dark and cruel. The joke implies that the landlord is more interested in filling the vacancy in his apartment than he is in saving the life of the tenant who is currently drowning in quicksand. This is callous and heartless, and thus, funny in a dark way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's dark and implies that the landlord is more concerned with getting a new tenant than saving the old one from dying in a room full of quicksand. The joke is also clever because it's a play on the phrase "the current tenant will be gone before the first of the month", which is often used to describe someone who is going to be evicted from their apartment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is dark and twisted. The landlord is implies that he's going to let the tenant drown in the quicksand so that the new tenant can move in. This is terrible because it's callous and it means that the landlord doesn't care about his tenants, only about making money.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men in suits are presumably the landlord and the future tenant of the apartment, and the landlord is casually remarking that the current tenant, who is drowning in quicksand, will be gone before the first of the month. The joke is dark because the landlord is unconcerned about the current tenant's fate and is more interested in renting out the apartment to the future tenant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the landlord is callously watching the tenant die in a pool of quicksand, with the future tenant standing next to him. The joke is further funny because it's darkly humorous: the landlord is implying that the tenant's death won't be a problem because the new tenant will move in before the old one's body is discovered.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's dark. The two men in suits are the landlord and the future tenant of the apartment, and they are watching the current tenant drown in quicksand. The joke is the callousness of the landlord, who is only interested in is business, and the future tenant, who is willing to wait for the current tenant to die so that he can move in.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's dark humor. The landlord is watching the tenant drown in the quicksand, and he's making a joke about how the new tenant won't have to worry about the old tenant being around anymore because he'll be dead. It's a morbid joke, but it's also a way of making light of a tragic and absurd situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men in suits are discussing the current tenant's imminent death in front of the future tenant. The future tenant is likely to be disturbed by this, and the fact that they are discussing it so matter-of-factly is darkly humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's dark and twisted. The landlord is watching the tenant die in a room full of quicksand, and he's making small talk with the future tenant about how the current tenant will be gone before the end of the month. It's callous and unfeeling, and the situation is made even more absurd by the fact that the entire room is quicksand.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's darkly humorous. The landlord is watching the current tenant drown in quicksand, and he's already thinking about the next tenant who will move in. He's not bothered by the fact that someone just died, and he's not going to help because it's not his problem. The humor comes from the callousness of the landlord.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the landlord is watching the current tenant die in front of the future tenant, and he is nonchalantly talking about how the current tenant will be gone before the end of the month. The joke is dark because the landlord is indifferent to the tenant's death, and is only concerned with getting a new tenant in quickly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the landlord is basically asking the future tenant if they want the apartment, even though the current tenant is in the process of dying in front of them. The joke is dark because the landlord is clearly more worried about getting a new tenant than saving the current one.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's dark and morbid. The landlord is watching the tenant die in front of the future tenant, and he nonchalantly remarks that the current tenant will be gone before the first of the month. This is cold and callous, and the humor comes from the contrast between the seriousness of the situation and the casual attitude of the landlord.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it's technically true that the current tenant will be gone before the first of the month (presumably because he will have died in the quicksand), it's a very cold and callous thing to say. The joke is even funnier because the future tenant is standing right there, witnessing the current tenant's demise.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="52.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="54.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
