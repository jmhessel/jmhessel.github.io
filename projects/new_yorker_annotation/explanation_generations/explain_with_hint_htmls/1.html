Thus, when the doctor is looking at Superman's X-rays, all he can see is Superman's skeleton, since Superman can see through his own skin. The doctor's comment implies that this is a very obvious fact, since Superman already knows that he can see through his own skin.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Superman, who has the ability to see through things with his x-ray vision, doesn't need the doctor to tell him what his x-rays say.

The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the doctor says that the x-rays show that Superman already knows what's wrong with him, i.e., he doesn't need to be told.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Superman has X-ray vision, which means that he can already see his own x-rays. The doctor is telling Superman something that he already knows, which is pointless. Furthermore, the doctor's use of a stethoscope is also pointless, since Superman has super hearing and would be able to hear his own heartbeat just fine without it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Superman has x-ray vision, so he would already know what the x-rays of his body show. The joke is poking fun at the fact that Superman doesn't really need to go to the doctor, because he can already see inside his own body.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Superman has x-ray vision, which means that he can already see his own x-rays.
