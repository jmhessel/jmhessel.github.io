The therapist is asking the man if he's always felt like a victim, meaning does he have a victim complex, where he feels like the world is against him. However, the man is an actual victim, as he's been chalked out like a crime scene, which suggests he was killed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist appears to be confusing the patient's feelings of being a victim with actual victimization, as in being the victim of a crime. The patient is likely talking about a "victim complex", which is a psychological condition where someone perceives themselves as being a victim even when they aren't. In contrast, the chalk outline in the bed is likely the result of an actual crime, where the victim was murdered. The juxtaposition of the two meanings of "victim" is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "victim complex" is a psychological condition where someone believes they are always being victimized, even when they aren't. In this case, the "patient" is literally a victim, as in, a victim of a crime. The fact that the therapist is talking to a chalk outline just adds to the absurdity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The therapist is asking the chalk outline of a man if he's always felt like a victim, meaning, does he feel like he's been dealt a bad hand in life. However, the fact that the patient is literally a victim of a crime makes the therapist's question unintentionally hilarious.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is asking a standard question during therapy sessions, but in this case, it is ironic because the patient is a literal victim of crime who has been outlined in chalk. The joke could also be interpreted as the therapist asking if the patient has always had a victim complex, which would be another standard question during therapy sessions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the office has a "victim complex", which means he feels like he's constantly being victimized by the world. However, the psychiatrist sees him as an actual victim --- someone who has been victimized by a crime, as evidenced by the chalk outline in the bed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man on the couch is literally a victim because he's been chalked out at a crime scene, but the therapist is asking if he's always felt like a victim, meaning does he have a victim complex. The fact that the man is a literal victim is unexpected and makes the joke funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is asking a question that could potentially apply to anyone who comes into their office seeking help. However, in this case, the patient is a literal victim of a crime, as they are outlined in chalk, and so the question takes on a new, more dark meaning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is asking a question that could be interpreted two ways. The first way is a normal question that a therapist would ask a patient to get to the root of their issues. The second way is asking if the patient has always felt like a victim of crime, given that the patient is literally a chalk outline of a person. The contrast between the two interpretations is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words.

In contrast, the chalk outline on the bed behind him is of a actual victim of a crime --- someone who was, quite literally, victimized. The psychiatrist's question to him points out the irony of his self-pity.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="0.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="2.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
