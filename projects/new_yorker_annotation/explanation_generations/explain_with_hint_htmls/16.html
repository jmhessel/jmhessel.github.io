The lawyers are only interested in getting a settlement from the Mongols, and they will only get paid if they are successful. The contrast between the modern-day lawyers and the ancient Mongols is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idea that lawyers will often only take a case if they think they can win and get a settlement. In this case, the lawyer is representing the two men on horses, who are Mongols, and the joke is that they are only charging a fee if they win, which is not how lawyers typically operate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men in suits are lawyers, and they are only interested in the case if they think they can win. This is a play on the stereotype that lawyers are only interested in cases if there is money to be made. However, the fact that the men in suits are from the future and the men on horses are from the past adds an additional layer of absurdity to the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The first meaning of "on the other hand" is that the two men on the horse could be Mongol soldiers, who were known for their looting and pillaging. However, the men could also be lawyers, which would explain why the businessmen are following them --- lawyers often charge on a contingency basis, meaning they only get paid if they win a settlement for their client.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men on the horses are Mongol soldiers, who were known for their brutality and tactics like raiding and pillaging. The joke suggests that the business men might be lawyers, and they are only following the Mongol soldiers because they hope to get a cut of any settlements or compensation that might be won as a result of the soldiers' actions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men in suits are lawyers who are chasing after the men on horses, who are presumably Mongolians. The joke is a play on the idea that Mongolians were ruthless invaders, and that the lawyers are trying to get a settlement from them. The lawyers only get paid if they win the case, which is why they are only charging a fee if they are successful.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The two men on the horse are Mongols, and they are known for pillaging and plundering. The businessmen who are following behind them are lawyers, and they are known for, among other things, charging for their services. The joke is that the lawyers are only charging if they "win," i.e., if the Mongols pillage and plunder successfully.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the stereotype that lawyers will only take a case if they think they can win and get a settlement. Here, the lawyer is telling the client (the man on the horse) that he will only charge a fee if they win, rather than getting paid upfront. The joke is clever because it is a reversal of the typical lawyer/client relationship.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in armor is being sued, and the man in the suit is his lawyer. The idea of a medieval knight being sued by a group of businessmen is already funny, but the joke is further exaggerated by the fact that the lawyer is only being paid if he wins the case; if the knight loses, the lawyer doesn't get paid. This is the opposite of how most lawyer's fees work, which just adds to the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The men in suits and ties are lawyers, and they are only paid if they win the case. The men on horses and in armor are the Mongols, and they are being charged for attacking a town. The lawyers are only going to get paid if the Mongols win, which is unlikely.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "on the other hand" is often used to introduce a different perspective or way of looking at something. In this case, the phrase is used to suggest that the lawyers only get paid if they win the case, which is the opposite of how it usually works.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in most cases, lawyers will only charge their clients if they win the case or get a settlement; this is usually taken as a good thing, because it means that the lawyers are incentivized to actually win the case. In this situation, the men in suits are lawyers who are following the men on horses, presumably because they want to sue them for something. The joke is funny because it's a play on the idea that the lawyers will only get paid if they win, but in this case, they'll only get paid if the men on horses lose.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Mongols were historically a very war-like people, and they are now being followed by lawyers. The lawyers are probably representing the people whom the Mongols have killed or harmed in some way, and they are only going to get paid if they win a settlement from the Mongols. This is a play on the fact that lawyers are often associated with being greedy and money-hungry.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "There is no fee unless we win." This phrase is often used by lawyers to describe their contingency fee arrangement, where they only charge if they win the case or get a settlement. In this instance, the joke is that the men in suits are actually lawyers, and they are only interested in the case if they think they can win, i.e., if the men on horses lose.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men in suits and ties are lawyers, and they are only interested in the case if they think they can win and get a settlement.
