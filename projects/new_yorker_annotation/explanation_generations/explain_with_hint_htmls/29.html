I've been elected queen.</p><p style="text-align:center;font-size:16px">(hint: queen bee vs. made queen)</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's excuse for not being able to leave is that she has been elected queen, but the context of her being inside a beehive and the man's face peering out makes it clear that she is the queen bee, not the human queen. This joke cleverly plays with the double meaning of the word "queen" to create a silly pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is telling the man that she can't go with him because she's been elected queen. However, she's not telling him that she's been made queen of a country or organization, but rather that she's been elected queen of the bees. Thus, she's saying that she can't leave her duties as queen bee to go with him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is talking to a man who is hidden in a beehive. The man says that he can't come out because he's been elected queen. This is silly because, while the man may have been elected queen of the bees in the hive, he's certainly not a queen in the traditional sense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's head being in the beehive suggests that he is the queen bee. However, he then says that he can't go because he's been "elected queen", which implies that he is not actually the queen bee, but has been given the title as a joke. The contrast between the two is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man says he can't go because he's been elected queen, but what he really means is that he can't go because he's been made queen of the bees. This is a Bee Hive, not a human hive, so the man is actually a bee. The woman is probably his girlfriend or wife, and she's surprised that he's been made queen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's response to being asked to leave with the man implies that she is the queen bee of the hive, when in fact, she is the queen bee because the man put her there against her will. This play on words is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the pun on "queen": the man's head is in a beehive, so he's technically the queen bee, but he's also been elected to be a queen, presumably of a country or something similar. The joke is clever because it's a play on words that is also a visual pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman says she can't leave because she's been elected queen, but it's clear from the context that she's referring to being elected queen bee of the hive, not queen of anything else. The Hive's election process is a play on the election of a human queen, which is a more serious and regal process.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's head in the beehive is being compared to a queen bee. The woman is asking him to come with her, but he says he can't because he's been elected queen. This is funny because, while being elected queen is a very honorable thing, it's not something that humans can do; only bees can be elected queen. Therefore, the man must be a bee.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is telling the man that he can't come down from the beehive because she's been elected queen. However, the man is clearly not a queen bee --- he's a human being who is stuck in a beehive. The joke is playing on the fact that "queen" can mean both the female leader of a hive and a woman who has been designated as a special or important person.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is saying that she can't go because she's been elected queen, as in queen bee. However, the man's head in the beehive is also a queen, but in the sense of being a queen in a game of hide-and-seek, which is not as impressive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's face peering out of the beehive is a reference to the queen bee. The woman says that she can't go (presumably because she's busy), and the man says that he can't go either because he's been elected queen. This is a play on words because the man has been elected to be the queen bee, but the woman is saying that she's the actual queen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the play on words between "queen bee" and "made queen." The woman in the picture has been "made queen" by the man in the beehive, who is presumably the queen bee. The man has given up his position as queen bee in order to make the woman queen, which is a humorous role reversal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is saying that she can't go because she's been "elected queen," but in reality, she's been elected queen bee. This is a pun because a queen bee is a type of bee, not a human queen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is saying that she can't go (with the speaker) because she's been elected queen, but she's also saying that she can't go because she's a queen bee.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="28.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="30.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
