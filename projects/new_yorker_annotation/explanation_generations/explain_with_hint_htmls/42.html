The phrase "the neighbors are right on top of us" usually means that the neighbors are too close for comfort, but in this case, it's even more extreme because the man is literally on top of them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker says that the neighbors are "right on top of us," when in fact they are suspended upside-down in the air. This is a play on words, as the phrase "right on top of us" usually means that someone is too close or too crowded, but in this case, the neighbors are actually quite far away and not crowding the speaker at all.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in the couple's upside down world, the neighbors are so on top of them that they literally live in the same backyard and can see each other's every move. This is a play on the phrase "right on top of us," which usually means that the neighbors are too close for comfort, but in this case, the neighbors are so close that they are right on top of the couple's heads.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. When people say "the neighbors are right on top of us," they usually mean that the neighbors are too close for comfort, i.e., the houses are too close together. In this case, the neighbors are actually on top of each other, because they are in an upside-down world.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "right on top of us" is usually used to mean that someone is too close/crowding us, but in this context, it literally means that the neighbor is on top of them, upside down. The fact that the neighbor is so close that he is literally on top of them is unexpected and funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "right on top of us": it can mean either that the neighbors are too close, or, in this case, that they are literally on top of the speakers' house.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "the neighbors are right on top of us" is usually used to describe how close the neighbors' houses are in proximity, but in this case, the neighbor is actually on top of the house, hanging upside-down from the fence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is making a normal complaint about her neighbors being too close, but in this case, the neighbors are literally on top of them, because they live in an upside down world.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the phrase "right on top of us" is usually used to describe how two houses are too close together, implying that the neighbors are too close for comfort. In this case, the neighbors are actually on top of the house (literally, because they are upside down), which takes the idea of being too close for comfort to a literal extreme.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in this upside-down scenario, the neighbors are actually "right on top of" the women in a literal sense. This close proximity would usually be considered a negative thing (hence the use of the phrase "right on top of us"), but in this case, it's just a matter of perspective.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is complaining about her neighbors being too close, but in this case, they literally are right on top of her because they live in an upside down world.

This is an unusual situation that is made even more humorous by the fact that the woman talking is completely nonchalant about it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Right on top of us" usually means that someone is too close/crowding us, but in this case, the neighbor is actually on top of them, upside down. The fact that the neighbor's house is also upside down makes it even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is clearly bothered by their neighbors being too close, but in this case, the neighbors are literally on top of them because they live in an upside down world.
