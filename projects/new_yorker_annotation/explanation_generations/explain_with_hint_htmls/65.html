In this case, the person inside the bubble broke up with their boyfriend because he was the latter: a sharp object that could pop her bubble. This is silly because it's a non-human object, and therefore not a capable romantic partner.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of the word "prick": in this context, it can mean either a mean or inconsiderate person (i.e., a bad boyfriend) or it can mean a sharp object that can pop a bubble. Therefore, the person had to break up with her last boyfriend because he was either a bad person or he popped her bubble (literally).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "prick" can mean a rude or unpleasant person, but it can also mean a sharp object that can puncture or pop a balloon. In this context, the woman broke up with her last boyfriend because he was the latter, and he would pop her bubble (metaphorically and literally).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The speaker had to break up with her last boyfriend because he was a mean person, a "prick". But, "prick" can also refer to a sharp object that can pop bubbles. In this case, the sharp object is her former boyfriend, who popped her bubble of happiness.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is talking about breaking up with her last boyfriend, and the word "prick" can mean both a bad person and a thing that can pop bubbles. In this context, the word "prick" isAmbiguous and can be interpreted in two ways, both of which are funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of this scene where everyone is inside of a bubble, the word "prick" has two meanings: a bad person, and a thing that can pop a bubble. The woman saying the joke is giving a literal reason for why she had to break up with her last boyfriend, which is absurd in the context of this scene.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is using the word "prick" in two ways: first, as a derogatory term for her ex-boyfriend, and second, as a word for the sharp object that can pop her bubble. In other words, her ex was "a bad person" and also "a thing that could pop her bubble."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person is describing their ex-boyfriend as a bad person, but "prick" can also mean something that can pop bubbles. In this context, it's funny because the person is saying that their last boyfriend was so bad that he popped their bubble, which is a literal interpretation of the phrase "he popped my bubble."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the word "prick" has two meanings: it can refer to a mean or unpleasant person ("My last boyfriend was a prick"), but it can also refer to a sharp object that can pop a bubble ("I had to break up with my last boyfriend because he was a prick").

In this case, the boyfriend popped her bubble, so she had to break up with him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the multiple meanings of "prick". A prick can refer to a mean or disliked person, but it can also refer to a sharp object that can pop a bubble. Therefore, the woman in the bubble is saying that she had to break up with her last boyfriend because he was mean, but also because he was the type of person that could pop her bubble (literally and figuratively).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of the bubbles, the word "prick" takes on a double meaning: not only is it a term for a unpleasant person, but it is also a word for something that can pop bubbles. So, the woman is saying that she had to break up with her last boyfriend because he was unpleasant, but also because he would pop her bubble, literarily and metaphorically speaking.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is describing her ex-boyfriend as a "prick." While this could just be a reference to him being a bad person, it could also be a reference to the fact that he could pop her bubble with his penis, which would be a problem for her given her bubble phobia.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the word "prick" has two meanings: (1) an insulting term for a person who is mean or rude and (2) a sharp object that can pop bubbles. In this context, the person broke up with her boyfriend because he was the latter: a sharp object that could pop her bubble and destroy the social-distancing she was trying to maintain.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "prick" can mean both a mean or unpleasant person as well as something that can pop a bubble.
