Well, I thought bookstores were extinct.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the fact that bookstores are struggling to stay in business in the modern day. The joke equates the bookstores with dinosaurs, something else that is going extinct, and the fact that there is a giant lizard in the bookstore emphasizes this point.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The dinosaur is in line for a book signing, which is a service that bookstores provide. However, bookstores have been struggling in recent years because of the rise of digital reading, which has led to many stores going out of business; in that sense, they can be said to be "extinct." The dinosaur jokes that since bookstores are going extinct, they must be too, since they are both from the same time period.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a pun on the word "extinct". Extinct can mean "no longer in existence" or "no longer occurring naturally". In the first sense, the joke is commenting on how bookstores are going out of business because of technological advancements like e-books; in the latter sense, the joke is commenting on how dinosaurs are no longer occurring naturally. The joke is clever because it can be interpreted in either way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's clever wordplay. The person making the joke is saying that bookstores, like dinosaurs, are going extinct. They are implying that the only people who still go to bookstores are ancient monsters like the big lizard in front of them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because bookstores are struggling due to the increase of digital books and online shopping, to the point where some people think they might go extinct. In contrast, dinosaurs are already extinct, so the fact that there is a dinosaur in line for a book signing is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the double meaning of "extinct". Extinct can mean "no longer in existence", which is often used to describe businesses like bookstores that are going out of style, or it can mean "no longer occurring in nature", which is often used to describe animals like dinosaurs. In this case, the joke is saying that bookstores are going out of style just like dinosaurs, i.e., they're both extinct.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "extinct" can mean two things: no longer in existence, or no longer available. In this case, the dinosaur is making a pun on the fact that bookstores are "extinct" in the sense that they are no longer common, due to the rise of digital media. But of course, dinosaurs are actually extinct in the other sense of the word.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because bookstores are struggling in the age of digital books, and are often said to be "going extinct." The fact that there is a giant lizard in the bookstore does not help the store's image, and the joke pokes fun at this by saying that the dinosaurs (i.e., the lizard) are also extinct.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "extinct" can mean two things: (1) no longer in existence, e.g., dinosaurs are extinct or (2) very rare, e.g., bookstores are becoming extinct. The joke is clever because it's technically true in both senses --- dinosaurs are extinct and bookstores are going out of business.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="105.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="107.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
