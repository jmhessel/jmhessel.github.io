The guy on the rack doesn't need it anymore.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The knight is in a tailor, trying on clothes, and he's told that the outfit he's interested in is "off the rack". However, "rack" can also refer to a torture device, and in this case, the man on the rack is dead. The joke is clever because it's a word play that also comments on the brutal nature of medieval warfare.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The knight is getting his suit tailored, and the tailor is telling him that the suit is "off the rack". However, there is also a rack in the room, which is a torture device where people would be stretched out. The joke is that the person who was previously on the rack (and is now dead) is the one who really doesn't need the suit anymore.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "rack" can refer to a torture device, or it can refer to a clothing rack. In this situation, the knight is trying on armor, and the man behind him is pointing out that the armor is "off the rack", meaning it's not custom made. The joke is that the man is actually referring to a torture device, and the knight is wearing the armor of a person who was tortured on the rack and is now dead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The Clothing rack is a rack where you would typically hang clothes in a store, but the torture device rack is a rack where people would be tortured on, and the person on the rack is dead. The joke is clever because it's a double meaning that is also a dark humor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "rack" in this situation could refer to either a clothing rack or a torture device rack. The man in the suit behind the knight is clearly a salesman trying to sell him a suit, but the knight is uninterested because he doesn't need it. However, the joke takes a dark turn because the man on the rack is implied to be dead, and the racks in this tailor are actually torture device racks. So, the salesman is actually trying to sell the knight a used torture device.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of the word "rack": in a clothing store, a rack is where clothes are displayed for customers to choose from. However, a rack can also refer to a torture device, where people were (literally) stretched on racks. In this case, the salesman is joking that the armor is so cheap because it came from a torture victim who doesn't need it anymore.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "rack" can refer to both a clothing rack and a torture device. In this case, the man in the suit is trying to sell the knight a piece of clothing, but the knight is confused because he thinks the man is selling him a torture device. When the man says that the "guy on the rack doesn't need it anymore," the knight realizes that the man is talking about a piece of clothing, and not a torture device, and that the guy on the rack is actually dead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "rack" in this context could either refer to a clothing rack where suits are hung up, or a torture device where people are stretched out. The latter meaning is implied by the fact that the man on the rack is no longer alive and therefore doesn't need his armor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "rack" can refer to a clothing rack or a torture device. The salesman quips that the armor is "off the rack" meaning that it's something that anyone can buy, not just knights. But, the joke is clever because "rack" can also refer to a torture device, and so the salesman is actually saying that the armor is from a torture device where the previous owner (a guy) is no longer in need of it because he's dead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The knight is in a clothing store, trying on armor, and the man is his consultant. The man says that the armor the knight is trying on is "off the rack", meaning that it's a pre-made item and not custom made. However, the knight misunderstood, and thought the man said that the armor was from a rack that people were tortured on, and the man says that the person who was on the rack before doesn't need it anymore because they're dead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implicitly sets up a contrast between a "clothing rack" (where one would normally hang suits) and a "torture device rack" (where one might find suits of armor in a medieval dungeon). However, the joke takes a dark turn when it is revealed that the "guy on the rack" is actually a dead body that is being used to hold the armor. The joke is made even more darkly humorous by the salesperson's casual attitude.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the suit is trying to sell the knight a piece of clothing that is on a rack, but the knight thinks he is being offered a rack, which is a torture device. The man in the suit says that the "guy on the rack" doesn't need it anymore, meaning that the clothes are available for purchase, but the knight thinks he is being told that the person who was tortured on the rack is now dead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between a clothing rack, which is where one would expect to find suits of armor in a store, and a torture device rack, which is where one would expect to find a person in a suit of armor. The latter, of course, is a much more morbid place, and the joke is thus funny because of the contrast in expectations.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The knight is trying on a new suit of armor, which the tailor says is off the rack. However, the rack that the armor is on is also a type of rack that people were tortured on in the Middle Ages. The joke is that the man on the rack is dead, and so he doesn't need the armor anymore.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "rack" can refer to either a clothing rack or a torture device. The knight is trying on armor, and the man behind him is holding up a chainmail shirt. The man makes a comment about how the shirt is "off the rack", meaning that it's a standard size and doesn't need to be custom made. However, the comment is also a dark reference to how the shirt was probably obtained: it was taken off of a dead man who was tortured on a rack.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="9.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="11.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
