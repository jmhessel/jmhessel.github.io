However, there is no air in space, so the alien is either mistaken or is playing a prank on the taxi driver.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the taxi driver is trying to be polite to his alien passenger by asking him to turn on the air, but there is no air in space! The joke is a play on the fact that most people are not familiar with the realities of space travel, and thus do not realize that there is no air in space.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the taxi driver is asking the alien to turn on the air, when in reality there is no air in space. The joke relies on a discrepancy between what the taxi driver expects (aliens to be able to breathe air) and what is actually true (aliens don't need to breathe air because there is no air in space).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the taxi driver is asking the alien for a common courtesy, turning on the air, which is impossible in space because there's no air in space. The taxi driver is either unaware of this fact, or is deliberately ignoring it in order to make a joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cab driver is asking for a service, turning on the air, that is impossible to provide in their current situation. The customer is unaware of their surroundings and is still thinking about earthly concerns like the temperature, even though they are in the vacuum of space. The joke is a play on the disconnect between the customer's expectations and the reality of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it points out the absurdity of the situation: the alien is asking for the taxi driver to turn on the air, but there is no air in space!</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cab driver is talking to his passengers as if they are in a normal car on Earth. However, they are in space, where there is no air. The cab driver is asking them to turn on the air conditioning, which is not possible because there is no air to cool.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the taxi driver is asking for the air to be turned on, but there is no air in space. The taxi driver is either unaware of this fact, or he is aware and is expecting his passengers to provide the air for him. Either way, it is a humorous request.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is asking for the air to be turned on in the taxi, when in reality, there is no air in space. The taxi is flying in space, so there is no atmosphere for the air to be contained in. The joke is a play on the fact that people often take the air for granted and don't realize how essential it is to their survival.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in the space taxi is asking the driver to turn on the air, when in fact there is no air in space. This is a play on the phrase "turn on the air conditioning," which is often used in hot weather. Here, the person is asking for the air to be turned on in a situation where there is no air to be turned on.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the alien is asking the taxi driver to turn on the air conditioning, even though there is no air in space. This highlights the alien's ignorance of basic Earth concepts (cabs, air conditioning) and is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the taxi driver is asking the alien to turn on the air, but there is no air in space. The taxi driver is either ignorant of this fact, or he is assuming that the alien has some sort of technology that can create air.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common phrase "would you mind turning on the air conditioning?" The man in the space cab is asking for the air to be turned on, but in space, there is no air, so the request is impossible to fulfill.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because there is no air in space, so the alien would not need the taxi driver to turn on the air. The alien is either ignorant of this fact, or is trying to be polite by making a common request of taxi drivers on Earth.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="9.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="11.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
