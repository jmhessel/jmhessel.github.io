This is similar to how many appliances these days come with a power cord but not the actual outlet plug, or how many electronic devices require batteries that are not included.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is in the middle of the desert trying to operate a washing machine, but they can't because it needs a solar panel to power it, and the solar panel wasn't included. This is silly because it's unlikely that anyone would try to operate a washing machine in the middle of the desert without first making sure they had the necessary equipment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is reading the user manual for the washing machine, and it says that the solar panel is sold separately. This is a problem because they are in the desert and there is no water, so they can't use the washing machine. The solar panel is necessary to power the machine, but it's not included, which is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is stranded in the desert with a broken washing machine. The husband looks disappointed while the wife tries to find a solution in the operator manual. The joke is clever because it is a play on the common practice of companies selling items with additional features sold separately. In this case, the couple needs a solar panel to power the washing machine, but it is something that would have to be bought separately.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is common knowledge that solar panels are used to power things in the desert, but this couple didn't realize that their washing machine needed a solar panel to run, and so they are stuck doing their laundry by hand.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is reading the manual for their washing machine and it says that the solar panel needed to power it is sold separately. The couple is in the desert, so there is no way for them to power the machine. They are also dressed like they are at home, which makes the situation even more absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is in the desert trying to figure out how to operate their washing machine, but they can't because it didn't come with a solar panel (which would be necessary to power it in the desert). This is a play on the fact that many products nowadays come with a "solar panel sold separately" warning --- even though solar panels are often needed to power the product, they are not included in the purchase.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because solar panels are often used to power things in the desert, where there is no access to a power grid. However, the couple in the joke does not have a solar panel, and thus cannot power the washing machine. The joke is clever because it is a play on words; the couple is trying to wash their clothes, but they cannot because they do not have the "solar panel" that is needed to power the machine.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is in the middle of the desert with a washing machine, but they can't use it because it didn't come with a solar panel. Solar panels are usually used to power things in the desert because there is no other source of power, so the fact that the washing machine didn't come with one is absurd.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="101.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="103.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
