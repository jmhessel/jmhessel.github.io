They like experienced.</p><p style="text-align:center;font-size:16px">(hint: male grasshoppers who have mated have heads eaten by females, these ones are experienced lovers, dating joke)</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "experienced" can mean two things: 1) having a lot of knowledge or skill in a particular area, and 2) having had sex before. In this case, it's clear that the person telling the joke is referring to the latter definition, since the grasshoppers in question have no heads. This is a dark joke, as it implies that the females prefer males who have already been decapitated (thus "experienced") because it makes the mating process easier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because grasshoppers mate by the male mounting the female from behind. However, during and after the act, the female will often eat the head of the male. As a result, a male grasshopper who has mated is said to be "experienced." In this case, the joke is comparing the experience of the male grasshoppers to that of a human male, implying that the human male is also "experienced" in a way that is not entirely flattering.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because male grasshoppers who have mated have their heads eaten by the females, so these ones are experienced lovers. The joke is making a light-hearted reference to this fact, and also to the fact that mantises are predators who eat other insects.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Experienced" can mean "skilled" or "knowledgeable," but in this case, it refers to the fact that these grasshoppers have had their heads eaten by females during mating season. Thus, they are "experienced" in the sense that they have mated before. The joke is a dark one, because it's implying that the decapitated insects are still desirable as mates, despite their lack of heads.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that male grasshoppers who mate with females often have their heads eaten by the female afterwards. In this case, the male praying mantis is assuring his date that he won't have the same fate, because he is experienced. The joke is also a clever play on words, because the word "experienced" can mean both "skilled" and "having had sex before."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that male grasshoppers who have mated have their heads eaten by the females. Therefore, these male mantises who have "dated" before are experienced in this sense, and the female mantises should trust them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully pokes at the grim reality of the mating ritual of mantises, in which the male mantis often has his head eaten by the female mantis after mating. In this case, the male mantises are seen as desirable mates because they are "experienced," meaning that they have survived the mating ritual and still have their heads. This is a humorous contrast to the usually negative connotations of being "experienced."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of headless grasshoppers (which are usually males who have had their heads eaten by females after mating) being considered "experienced" at something, particularly dating. The joke is clever because it uses the double meaning of "experienced" to be funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "experienced". In one sense, the male mantis is saying that the female mantis will like him because he is experienced in the sense that he has mated before. In another sense, he is saying that he is experienced in the sense that he knows how to satisfy a woman sexually, given that post-coital cannibalism is common among mantises.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the male praying mantis is known for being eaten by the female after mating. In this case, the joke is that the male mantises are so experienced that they are the ones doing the eating. The joke is a play on the fact that most people believe that it is the female who is the experienced one when it comes to dating.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in many grasshopper species, the female will decapitate the male after mating. This is because the male's head contains a lot of nutrients that the female needs in order to produce eggs. Thus, these two Headless insects are likely experienced mates, and the joke is a play on the oft-quoted (and often true) dating advice to "date someone who is experienced."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it references a male grasshopper's fear of being eaten by the female after mating. However, these two male grasshoppers are large and Human-sized, so the fear is reversed. The joke is also a play on the fact that, in the world of online dating, many people lie about their experience level in order to seem more attractive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. Normally, when someone says "trust me," they are asking you to believe them. In this case, the speaker is saying "trust me" in regards to the headless grasshoppers, which is a pun on the fact that these grasshoppers have been decapitated (i.e., they don't have heads). The speaker is saying that the grasshoppers are experienced because they have mated before --- and in the mating process, the female grasshopper typically eats the head of the male.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "experienced" can mean both " having a lot of experience, especially in a particular activity" and " having had sexual intercourse." In this case, the grasshoppers are "experienced" in the latter sense --- they have mated before, and thus their heads have been eaten by females. Thus, they are quite literally "experienced lovers."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "experienced": usually when people talk about an "experienced" lover, they mean someone who has had a lot of sexual partners. However, in this case, the Mantises are "experienced" in the sense that they have survived the mating process: females often eat the heads of their mates after copulation, but these males have avoided that fate. Thus, they are quite literally "experienced" when it comes to sex.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="104.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="106.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
