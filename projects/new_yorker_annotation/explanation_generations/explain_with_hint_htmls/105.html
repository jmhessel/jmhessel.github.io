In this case, the man carrying the bomb is telling the people in the room that they can only stay for fifteen seconds, which is the amount of time before the bomb explodes. The joke is funny because it's a very unusual situation to be in, and the man's matter-of-fact attitude about the impending explosion is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the phrase "to drop a bomb." In this case, the neighbors are actually dropping a bomb, which will explode in fifteen seconds. The joke is also a play on words because the guests are telling the hosts that they won't stay long, even though they are the ones who are dropping the bomb.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the bomb is about to kill everyone in the room, yet they are all still acting casual and inviting him in. The fact that they are only giving him a fifteen second window before the bomb explodes highlights the absurdity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common phrase "It's great to see you, but we can only stay for a few minutes." In this case, the time limit is dictated by the fact that there is a bomb about to explode, and the speaker wants to get rid of the visitors before that happens.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man carrying the bomb into the room is telling the people there that he can only stay for a short time, implying that the bomb is going to explode soon. This is a play on the idea of a "bomb dropping," where someone brings bad news. In this case, the bad news is literal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the bomb has a nonchalant attitude, as if he's just dropping by for a quick visit. The fact that he has a bomb that is about to explode makes the situation much more dire than it would be otherwise, and the joke is funny because of the contrast between the seriousness of the situation and the casual attitude of the man.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man carrying the bomb into the room is telling the people inside that they need to leave soon, because the bomb is going to explode. The absurdity is that the man is still carrying the bomb, and will be in the room when it explodes. The man is essentially telling the people to leave so he can blow himself up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the disparity between the man's casual demeanor and the bomb he's holding. The fact that he's holding a bomb that is about to explode would typically elicit a more panicked response, but in this case, everyone is just calmly chatting. The joke is emphasizing the contrast between the extreme danger of the situation and the nonchalance of the people involved.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a bit of a non-sequitur. The man and woman are being polite to their neighbors by letting them in, but the neighbors are carrying a bomb that is about to go off. The joke is that the man and woman are being polite even though they know they are in danger.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="104.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="106.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
