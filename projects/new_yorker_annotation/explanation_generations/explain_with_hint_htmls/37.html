The woman's suggestion to plant potatoes is absurd because it will be a long time before the meat is ready to eat. This joke is also a play on the idiom "kill two birds with one stone."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity between the modern-day cooking method (grilling) and the ancient subject matter (cavemen). The fact that the caveman is cooking a giant leg of meat also amplifies the joke, because it would take a very long time to cook such a big piece of meat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the size of the chicken leg relative to the caveman cooking it. A 15 minute cook time per pound is usually reserved for an entire turkey or other very large piece of meat. However, this caveman is cooking just a chicken leg, which would usually take a fraction of that time to cook. The joke is that the caveman is so dim-witted that he doesn't realize this, and so he tells the woman to go ahead and plant the potatoes (which takes a long time) while the chicken leg is cooking.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is cooking a gigantic chicken leg, which would obviously take much longer to cook than a normal sized chicken leg. The joke is clever because it plays on the fact that 15 minutes per pound is a guideline for cooking chicken, but in this case, the caveman is taking the advice literally and planting potatoes while the chicken cooks.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is cooking a very large piece of meat, which will take a long time to cook. The other cavepeople are telling him to go ahead and plant the potatoes, which need to be cooked for a shorter amount of time, while they wait for the meat to finish cooking. This is a play on the common saying "a watched pot never boils", which is used to describe how time seems to move more slowly when someone is waiting for something to happen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common cooking advice to "cook chicken for 15 minutes per pound". However, in this case, the caveman is cooking a very large chicken leg, so it would take a very long time to cook properly. The joke is funny because it is a absurd exaggeration of the common cooking advice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the situation: the meat is so big that it will take a long time to cook, yet the caveman is telling the woman to go ahead and plant the potatoes. This implies that the caveman doesn't think the woman will be able to do both tasks (cook the meat and plant the potatoes) in a timely manner.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is cooking a very large piece of meat, which would take a long time to cook. The suggestion that he should also plant potatoes is absurd because it would take even longer for the potatoes to grow than it would for the meat to cook.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is cooking a giant leg of meat, which will take a long time to cook. In the meantime, his family can plant potatoes, which is a type of food that can be cooked in a shorter amount of time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is cooking a very large chicken leg, which would take a long time to cook thoroughly, and the caveman woman is telling him to plant potatoes while he waits. The joke is poking fun at the fact that cavemen were not known for their abundance of patience, and also, that it would be very difficult to cook a chicken leg that big properly in such a short time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, first, the caveman is preparing a meal that will take a very long time to cook, meaning that the other cavepeople will have to wait a while to eat. Second, the caveman is telling the woman to go ahead and plant potatoes, as if that is something she can do while the meat is cooking, when really, she should be helping with the meal. This is a silly suggestion because it's not really possible to multi-task like that.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is cooking a very large piece of meat, which will take a long time to cook. The caveman's wife tells him to plant potatoes while he's waiting, which is a long-term project that will take much longer than the 15 minutes per pound that the meat needs to cook. The joke is clever because it's a play on the fact that 15 minutes per pound is a very common way to cook chicken, so the wife's suggestion is much more absurd in comparison.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The caveman is cooking a huge chicken leg, which will take 15 minutes per pound to cook. While the potatoes should be planted, the caveman is telling the cavewoman to go ahead and plant them, because it will be a while before the chicken leg is done cooking.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is barbecuing a gigantic chicken leg, which would take a very long time to cook thoroughly. The fact that he is starting to cook the potatoes at the same time suggests that he doesn't realize how long it will take for the chicken to be done, or that he doesn't care and is just going to let the potatoes cook for however long it takes. Either way, it's amusing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while a huge chicken leg would take a long time to cook, the addition of planting potatoes implies that the process will take so long that the cavemen will be there for the entire day, or longer. This is a comical exaggeration of how long it would really take to cook such a large piece of meat.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="36.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="38.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
