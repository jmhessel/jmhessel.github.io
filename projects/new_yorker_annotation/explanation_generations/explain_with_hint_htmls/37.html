However, given that the children in this scene are defy gravity by walking on the walls and ceiling, it's clear that the speaker is misunderstanding the situation. The speaker is confusing the law of gravity (which is a physical law governing how objects move in relation to each other) with the law of the land (which is a set of rules governing how people should behave).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. When the speaker says "the law," they are referring to the school's rules that the children are supposedly breaking by walking on the walls and ceiling. However, they are also referring to the actual "law of gravity," which is the scientific principle that objects are attracted to each other based on their mass and distance. In this scene, the children are defying the law of gravity by walking on the walls and ceiling, which is why the speaker is surprised.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it's common to talk about respecting the law, the phrase "the law of gravity" is not something one typically hears. In this context, it's funny because the speaker is suggesting that the children used to have more respect for the physical law of gravity, but now they are ignoring it altogether by walking on the walls and ceiling.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In this scene, the children are not respecting the law, i.e., the physical law that objects fall towards the ground. Rather, they are respecting the law of gravity, which is something different entirely. The joke is clever because it's a play on how similar "the law" and "the law of gravity" sound.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker implies that, while respecting the law is normal, respecting the "law of gravity" is not. This is a play on words, because the law of gravity is, of course, a real law --- but it's not something that people usually think about or respect. In this context, it's funny because the children are literally defying the law of gravity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while respect for the law is a normal thing to expect from children, in this scene, the law of gravity does not exist, so the expectation is reversed. The joke is a play on words, where the "law" the speaker is referring to is not a legal law, but the law of gravity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the adult is talking about how, back in his day, kids had more respect for the law. The law of gravity is a real law, but it's an unusual law to have respect for, because it's not something that people can choose to obey or disobey. It's a natural law. The joke is funny because the adult is talking about how, back in his day, kids had more respect for natural law, even though they can't help but obey it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the adult is talking about how, back in his day, children had respect for the law. The joke is funny because there is a "law of gravity" which is a actual law, but it's not something that people usually have respect for. In this scene, the kids are defying gravity by walking on the walls and ceiling, so the adult's comment is ironic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of the children walking on the walls and ceiling, the speaker is saying that, in their day, kids had respect for the law --- which is still a relevant and important thing to have respect for --- but they are specifically contrasting it with the law of gravity, which is something that the kids in this scene are blatantly disrespecting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The speaker is saying that in his day, kids respected the law, i.e., the legal system. However, the fact that the children are walking on the walls and ceiling suggests that they don't respect the "law of gravity," which is the scientific principle behind why objects fall to the ground.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "the law of gravity" is a scientific term, but it is also a common saying, meaning that people should be respectful of the rules. In this case, the speaker is saying that kids nowadays don't respect the rules, even the basic rule of gravity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The speaker is saying that, back in their day, kids were more respectful of the law, meaning the police or a governing body. However, because there is no gravity in this scene, the law the speaker is referring to is the law of gravity, which the kids are ignoring by walking on the walls and ceiling. The joke is that, while respecting the law is a good thing, respecting the law of gravity isn't really something that people can choose to do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "the law" typically refers to a system of rules that people are expected to follow. In this case, the speaker is saying that, back in their day, kids had more respect for the law, as in the legal system. However, they are also saying that kids had more respect for the "law of gravity," which, of course, is not a law that people can choose to follow or not. The joke is clever because it is a play on words that makes you think about the original phrase in a different way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is acting as if the law of gravity is something that can be respected or not respected. But, of course, the law of gravity is a scientific law, not a social law. The speaker is thus treating the law of gravity as if it is something that children can choose to follow or not.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while respect for the law is a common value that adults try to instill in children, in this particular instance, the law being referenced is the law of gravity. In a world where gravity doesn't exist, the joke is that the speaker is asking for something that is impossible.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="36.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="38.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
