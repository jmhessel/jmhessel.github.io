The woman's reaction implies that she is not happy about the man's hobby, and the joke is that he would need to stop skydiving in order to have a chance at getting her pregnant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is asking if the man is sure that he is "ovulating now," meaning, are you sure that you are producing sperm now. However, the man is a stuntman, and "ovulating" can also mean opening one's parachute. Thus, the woman is asking if he is sure that he is doing his stunt correctly at the moment, which is a funny question to ask given that he is already in the middle of the stunt.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman in the bathrobe appears to be pregnant, and the man with the parachute is asking her if she is sure she is ovulating now because he wants to know if he should stop parachuting. This is funny because it is an unusual request: most people would want to stop parachuting because it is dangerous, but this man is only interested in stopping because it could potentially harm the fetus if he keeps doing it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's reaction to seeing the man with a parachute is one of annoyance, rather than excitement or fear. This is because, in order to get pregnant, couples often have to have sex at specific times. Thus, the woman is saying that the man's parachute stunt is poor timing because it's interrupting their efforts to conceive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's an unexpected thing to ask someone you've just met, especially given the context. The woman in the bathrobe is likely ovulating (i.e. able to get pregnant), but it's an unusual thing to ask, and made even more unusual by the fact that the man is still wearing his parachute. The man's parachute is a hindrance to him getting close to the woman to check if she's ovulating, so he's asking her instead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman in the bathrobe is clearly not pleased to see the parachutist, who has landed on her property, and is now questioning whether or not he's following her menstrual cycle in order to try and time impregnating her. It's an invasion of privacy and also a ridiculous thing to ask, as though impregnating her were the only goal of his parachute jump.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, although the woman is clearly surprised to see a man in a stuntman costume come through her door, she is more concerned with the fact that he might not be timing his stunts correctly with her ovulation cycle. This implies that, in order for the couple to conceive a child, the man would need to give up his stunts, which is a pretty big ask.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur. The man in the costume is clearly a stuntman, and the woman's question about whether or not he's ovulating doesn't make sense in relation to that. It's as if she's saying that he can't be a stuntman now because he needs to focus on trying to get her pregnant. The joke is funny because it's unexpected and because it's a play on the fact that it can be difficult to get pregnant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's question implies that the man's stunt could potentially endanger any children she may be carrying. It's also ironic because, in order to conceive in the first place, couples often have to stop doing things like parachuting that could potentially harm a fetus.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="58.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="60.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
