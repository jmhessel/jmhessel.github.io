Additionally, the joke suggests that the naked man is only doing this because he gets free drinks, which is a benefit of first class travel. The joke is clever because it is implied that the naked man would otherwise have his tray table up, which would be disruptive to other passengers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is naked and the tray table is down, implying that he is taking advantage of the policy to keep tray tables down during takeoff and landing. This is a play on the phrase "the seatbelt sign is on, please make sure your tray table is in the upright and locked position." In this case, the man is "upright" but not "locked" because he is naked.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is naked, but he's trying to be discreet by keeping his tray table down. The joke is also a play on the fact that airlines often give out complimentary drinks to first-class passengers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that naked people usually have to keep their genitals covered in public. In this case, the naked man is keeping his genitals covered by keeping his tray table down; if the tray table were up, he would expose himself to the other passengers. By keeping his tray table down, he is entitled to free drinks from the airline.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the in-flight safety instructions to keep your tray table up during takeoff and landing. In this case, the naked man is using the tray table to cover his genitalia, since he would otherwise be exposing himself to the other passengers. The joke is clever because it's a double-entendre: both the tray table and the man's penis are "up," but for different reasons.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in order to get free drinks from the airline, the man is keeping his tray table down so that he doesn't expose himself. This is a play on the fact that many airlines will give passengers free drinks if they keep their tray tables down during takeoff and landing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the naked man is taking advantage of the fact that he would be exposing himself if he put his tray table up. By keeping his tray table down, the airline is giving him free drinks as a reward for not exposing himself to the other passengers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully subverts the purposes of having tray tables on an airplane. Instead of using it as a surface on which to place food or drinks, the naked man is using is as a way to cover his genitals, implying that he would expose himself if the tray table was not down. The joke is clever because it is a double-entendre: the man is literally naked, and thus not wearing any clothing, and he is also figuratively naked, or exposed, without the tray table covering him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is naked except for a strategically placed seatbelt, and he is casually talking to the fully clothed man next to him. The joke is clever because it playfully hints at the fact that the naked man would be exposing himself if he were to put his tray table up, which is a violation of airline rules.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while keeping your tray table down during takeoff and landing is a standard airline safety precaution, in this case, the naked man is using it as an opportunity to get free drinks from the flight attendants by keeping his tray table down and thereby avoiding exposing himself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the words "free drinks". In this context, "free drinks" means alcoholic beverages that are complimentary for passengers. However, the fact that the man is naked suggests that he is taking advantage of the situation: he is exposing himself to other passengers, and in exchange, he is getting free drinks.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has found a way to exploit the system and get free drinks by being nude. This is a play on the fact that many people take advantage of the system in order to get freebies or perks that they aren't entitled to.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the double-meaning of the word "expose": in this case, the man is exposing himself in two ways, both literally and figuratively. The fact that he is naked is exposure in the literal sense, but by keeping his tray table down, he is also exposing himself to the scrutiny and judgement of the other passengers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the casual way the naked man is talking about getting free drinks from the airline (as if it's a normal thing that happens) and the fact that he is completely nude. The joke is also a play on the fact that people are typically told to keep their tray tables down during takeoff and landing for safety reasons.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="24.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="26.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
