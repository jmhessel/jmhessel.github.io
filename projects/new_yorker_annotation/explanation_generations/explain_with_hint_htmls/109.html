The baby is saying "thanks for having me" which is a common phrase performers say to their hosts, but in this case, the baby is saying it to his parents who "had" him in the sense that they gave birth to him.

In this case, the baby is the performer, and the parents are the audience. The joke is further funny because it's implied that the baby is thanking the parents for "having" him, i.e., for giving birth to him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "having me." In the context of a stand-up comedy routine, "thanks for having me," is a common phrase performers use at the beginning or end of their sets to thank the venue or club for letting them perform. However, in this case, the baby is saying "thanks for having me," to his parents, implying that they gave birth to him, which is a much more significant thing than just letting him perform at a club.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the baby is giving a speech in his crib to his parents, and he starts off by saying "thanks for having me". This is a common phrase for performers to say to their hosts, but in this case, it's absurd because the baby is thanking his parents for giving birth to him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the baby is thanking his parents for "having him" --- but of course, his parents had him, they didn't just host him like they would a performer at a comedy club. The joke is a play on words, with the phrase "thanks for having me" typically used by a performer at the beginning of their set, but in this case, it is the baby who is the performer, and he is thanking his parents for giving birth to him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the baby is using a common phrase that performers say to their hosts ("thanks for having me"), but in this case, it's the parents who are "having" the baby. The joke is clever because it's a play on words, but it's also a bit dark because it reminds the reader that the parents went through the pain of childbirth in order to have the baby.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because babies are not usually capable of giving speeches, let alone stand-up comedy routines. But, in this case, the baby is thanking his parents for "having him" --- which, of course, is a reference to the fact that they gave birth to him. So, the joke is playing on the double meaning of the phrase "thanks for having me."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "thanks for having me" is a common courtesy said by a performer to their audience after a show. In this case, the baby is the performer and the parents are the audience, but instead of the parents "having" the baby in the sense of providing them a place to stay or raising them, they "had" the baby in the sense of giving birth to them. So, the baby is thanking the parents for giving birth to them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the baby is standing in front of the microphone doing a stand-up comedy routine, which is something that babies can't do. The joke is made funnier by the fact that the baby is thanking the parents for "having" him, which is a play on words because the parents didn't have the baby, the baby was born to them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully inverts the common saying "thanks for having me" which a performer would say to their audience. In this case, the baby is saying it to his parents, meaning that they should be thanking him for giving them the privilege of being his parents and giving them life. The joke also works on a second level, as "giving birth" is often a euphemism for dying, so the baby could be interpreted as saying that his parents should be thankful that he's going to die and go to heaven soon.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because babies are not usually known for their oratory skills, so it's absurd that this baby is giving a speech. The joke is further exaggerated by the fact that the baby thanks his parents for "having" him, which is a polite way of saying "thank you for giving birth to me." This is absurd because, of course, the parents did not have the baby, the baby was born to them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "having me." On the one hand, it's a standard phrase performers use to thank their hosts, i.e., the people who invited them to perform. On the other hand, the literal meaning of "having me" is giving birth to someone --- in this case, the baby is thanking his parents for giving birth to him. Thus, the joke is simultaneously a clever play on words and a clever observation about the nature of stand-up comedy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "thanks for having me" is common for a performer to say at the beginning of their show, to thank the audience for attending. However, in this context, the baby is saying it to the parents, and the meaning is changed to "thanks for giving birth to me." This is funny because it's a reversal of the typical relationship between a performer and their audience.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the baby is giving a speech in his crib, thanking his parents for "having him" --- which is a play on the phrase "thanks for having me" that performers often say to their hosts. However, in this case, the baby is thanking his parents for "having him" in a literal sense, as in, giving birth to him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The baby is thanking the parents for "having him," which of course is a reference to the fact that they gave birth to him. But the phrase "having me" is also a common thing for a performer to say at the beginning of their show, as in "I'd like to start off by saying thanks for having me." So the joke is that the baby is both thanking the parents for giving birth to him, and also thanking them for giving him the opportunity to perform.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="108.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="110.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
