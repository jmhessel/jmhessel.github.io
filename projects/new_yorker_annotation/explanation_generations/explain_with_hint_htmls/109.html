This joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the father is normally talking about age demographics when he says "fifty and over," but in this case, he's referring to the size demographic, i.e., people who are over fifty feet tall.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in advertising, there is often a focus on attracting certain demographics, i.e., groups of people with common characteristics. In this case, the man is excited because they have finally attracted the fifty-foot-and-over demographic, which presumably are people who are extremely tall. The joke is clever because it's a play on words --- usually when people talk about attracting a certain demographic, they are talking about age group, gender, income, etc., but in this case, the demographic is literally fifty feet and over.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the office is watching a giant woman cause havoc while carrying a car, and he remarks that they've finally attracted the "fifty-foot-and-over" demographic. The man is referring to the fact that the woman is over fifty feet tall, but the phrase "fifty-foot-and-over" is usually used to mean that a person is over the age of fifty. Thus, the man's statement is both a literal description of the woman and a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is referring to the giant woman as if she is a target market for their product/company. The joke is a play on the fact that "fifty and over" is often used to describe the age of a target market/consumer, whereas in this case "fifty foot and over" refers to the height of the giant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the fifty-foot-and-over demographic usually refers to people who are fifty years old or older. Here, the fifty-foot-and-over demographic refers to people who are fifty feet tall or taller. The joke is clever because it's a play on words; instead of referring to age, it's referring to height.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Fifty-foot-and-over" is usually used to refer to people who are 50 years old or older, but in this case, it refers to the giant woman's height. The man is excited because he's finally attracted the attention of this target demographic --- a giant woman.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is clearly excited at the sight of the giant woman, and he attributes this to the fact that they've finally attracted the fifty-foot-and-over demographic. However, this is a double meaning, because the man could also be referring to the fact that they've attracted the attention of people who are fifty years old or older, which is usually the desired demographic for advertising.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The fifty-foot-and-over demographic usually refers to people over the age of fifty, but in this case, it's referring to the height of the giant outside. This is a clever way to market to a very specific group of people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is excited because they have finally attracted the attention of people who are fifty feet tall or more. However, in most contexts, the fifty-foot-and-over demographic would refer to people who are over the age of fifty.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="108.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="110.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
