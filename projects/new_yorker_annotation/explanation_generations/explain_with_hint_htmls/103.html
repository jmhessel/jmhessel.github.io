The man is saying that he should have jumped from a higher floor, implying that he jumped off a building, in order to kill himself. However, he didn't jump high enough and now he's just an inconvenience to the pedestrians. The joke is dark because it's making light of a serious topic, but it's also clever because it's playing with the idea of the bystander effect: people are often more likely to help someone in need if they are the only one around, but if there are other people around, they often assume someone else will help. In this case, the man is assuming that someone will help him, but no one does.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a dark joke about suicide.
