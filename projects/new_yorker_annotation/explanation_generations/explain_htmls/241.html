The man is not from the island because he is wearing a business suit and is carrying a briefcase, which are not typical beach attire. The man is also not wearing any shoes, which is another sign that he does not belong on the island. The joke is telling him to relax and take off his shoe, which is a way of telling him to leave the island.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a common advice given to people who are tense or have a lot of stress in their life. It's usually not phrased as an order, but more as a suggestion. In this case, the tattered man is so stressed that he mistakes the relaxing businessman for a shoe. The fact that he is so stressed that he mistakes a person for an inanimate object is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is telling the other man to relax, implying that he is not in a good state, when in fact it is the man who is telling the joke who is in a bad state. The man telling the joke is likely to be dehydrated from being in the sun too long, and so telling him to take his shoe off is a way of telling him to electrolyte balance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is telling the other man to relax is clearly more relaxed than the man he is talking to. The man who is telling the other man to relax is dressed in casual clothes appropriate for the beach, whereas the other man is dressed in a suit, which is not appropriate for the beach. Furthermore, the man who is telling the other man to relax is barefoot, whereas the other man still has his shoes on. The man who is telling the other man to relax is clearly more comfortable and at ease in the situation, which makes the advice humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is telling the other man to relax, but the word "relax" can also mean "to take off your shoe". This play on words is a common type of joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the well-fed man has just told the other man to relax, as if he isn't aware of the predicament they're in. It's as if the well-fed man doesn't realize that they're both stranded on an island, and so he's telling the other man to do something that doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is just relaxing on the island is telling the other man to relax. However, the fact that the other man is wearing a suit and has a briefcase suggests that he is a businessman and is very stressed out. The joke is funny because the businessman is so stressed that he is not even enjoying his vacation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the well-fed man on the beach is telling the other man to relax, as if he isn't in a difficult situation. The man looks like he is in dire straits, yet the other man is telling him to take his shoe off and relax. This is funny because it's a non-solution to the man's problem, and it's also a play on the phrase "put your best foot forward."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is well-fed is telling the other man to relax, as if he isn't in a dire situation. The man who is well-fed is presumably telling the other man to take his shoe off so he can tan his foot, but the words "relax" and "take off your shoe" can also be interpreted as telling the other man to masturbate. The second interpretation is funnier because it's unexpected and because it's a more inappropriate thing to say to someone who is struggling.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is just relaxing on the island is telling the man who is staring at him to relax. The man who is staring at him is probably stressed out from work and is not used to being on a beach. The man who is relaxing is telling him to take off his shoe because he is probably wearing business shoes which are not meant for the beach.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is relaxing under the palm tree tells the man who is staring at him to relax. The man who is staring at him is probably stressed out because he is lost at sea and doesn't know how he will get back to civilization. The man who is relaxing tells him to take his shoe off, implying that he doesn't need to be so stressed out because he is on a beach and can just enjoy the summer weather.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is relaxing on the island is telling the man who is staring at him to relax. The fact that the man is wearing a business suit and has a briefcase suggests that he is stressed out and needs to relax. However, the fact that the man is on a small island with a palm tree and is wearing a business suit suggests that he is not actually on a vacation, but is, in fact, stranded. The joke is funny because it is a play on the common advice to relax and take a vacation, but the man cannot actually take a vacation because he is stranded.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is well-fed is telling the other man to take his shoe off, as if to relax. However, the man who is well-fed is not wearing any shoes, and he has a full meal, implying that he has been on the island long enough to catch food, while the other man has not. The man who is well-fed is telling the other man to take his shoe off so he can have something to eat, implying that he plans to eat the other man.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is well-fed is telling the other man to relax, even though they are both stranded on the same island. The man who is well-fed is telling the other man to take off his shoe, even though the other man does not have any food. This implies that the man who is well-fed found food on the island, but is keeping it to himself instead of sharing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is telling the other man to relax, but the only way to do so would be to take his shoe off, which would be difficult since he's not wearing any shoes. The man is also telling him to do something that he's already doing (relaxing), which is another layer of absurdity.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
