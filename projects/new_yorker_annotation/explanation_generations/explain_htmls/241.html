This is humorous because, of course, a snowman would not still be employed at the store come spring, since he would have melted.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The snowman is observing the two women, and he makes a comment about how one of them won't be around in the spring. The joke is that, because the snowman is made of snow, he will also not be around in the spring: the comment is a clever way of saying that the snowman knows he's going to melt and won't be around for much longer.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common saying "they didn't say who, but one of us won't be here in the spring." The people in the store didn't say which one of them would be gone, but it's implied that the snowman won't be around in the spring because he'll melt.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the two women's attitudes: one is excited at the prospect of a new job, while the other is more cynical and paranoid, thinking that the store is going to lay one of them off come spring. The snowman, in its silent observing, represents the looming presence of the store's management, which may or may not be making decisions that will affect the women's employment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The person who said "they just said one of us won't be here in the spring" could be referring to the fact that one of the women won't be working at the store in the spring, or, in a more literal sense, that one of them will be melting because they are a snowman. The joke is clever because it can be interpreted in two ways, both of which are equally humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the two co-workers talking about one of them leaving the store in the spring, and the fact that the snowman is also in the store. Snowmen melt in the spring, so the implication is that the snowman will be the one leaving, not one of the co-workers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it's not impossible for a snowman to come into the store and shop, it's very unlikely. The store employees' comment implies that they think the snowman is a person, which is why they're worried about one of them not being there in the spring. However, since the snowman is not actually a person, there's no need to worry.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snowman is worried that he will melt in the springtime, and he doesn't know which one of the women will be the one to "win" and stay in the store. The joke is a play on the fact that, in the context of a department store, the word "win" usually means to buy something or to get a good deal --- but in this case, the snowman is using it in the literal sense of "to stay alive".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that, in winter, it's common for people to say things like "one of us won't be here come spring" ---in other words, someone will have died by then. In the context of the snowman, however, the snowman is the one who won't be around come spring, because it will have melted. The fact that the snowman can overhear the conversation and is aware of its own impending demise is what makes the joke darkly funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The snowman is made of snow, which melts in spring, so the co-workers are saying that one of them won't be around in the spring, meaning that the snowman will melt. However, the joke could also be interpreted to mean that one of the co-workers will be fired in the spring, signifying that the snowman will still be around but the co-worker will not.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the fact that, in winter, snowmen "melt" (i.e. they disappear) when the weather gets warm. So, the fact that one of the workers won't be there in the spring could mean either that they got laid off/fired, or that they melted.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "spring" can mean both the season and the act of jumping, as in "one of us won't be here next spring." In contrast, the other meaning of "spring" is a type of coil, which is what a snowman is made of. So, the joke is that the snowman won't be around next spring because it will melt, and also because it's made of coils and not a real person.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast in the two possible meanings of the word "spring". In one sense, "spring" refers to the season of the year, which the snowman will not be around for because he will melt. However, "spring" can also refer to a type of trap, which is what the snowman is setting for the women by watching them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of the snowman shopping in the store, the co-workers' conversation takes on a whole new meaning. The co-workers are presumably talking about the fact that one of them won't have a job come springtime, which is a reference to the fact that snowmen melt in spring. The contrast between the innocent words and the snowman context makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "snowman" can mean two things: first, a man made of snow, and second, a term for a white person. In this joke, the snowman is a white person, and the retailer is making a joke about how white people will be replaced by people of other races in the spring (a time when snowmen melt). This is a clever play on words that uses the double meaning of the word "snowman" to create a joke.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="240.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="242.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
