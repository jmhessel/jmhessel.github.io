This is a reference to the way that some political candidates want to "cut" or "disappear" the middle class, by creating policies that will hurt them financially. The juggler is thus a metaphor for how these policies will hurt the middle class.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man behind the podium is telling the juggler to perform a dangerous stunt that will make the middle class disappear. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the middle class will "disappear" if the man successfully juggles the chainsaws (i.e. they will be amazed and no longer paying attention to the issues), or they will literally disappear if he drops the chainsaws on them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the film "The Prestige", in which two magicians engaged in a rivalry perform increasingly dangerous and life-threatening tricks in order to one-up each other. In the context of a debate, the juggler is trying to show the audience a "trick" that will make the middle class disappear; the other man is whispering to him because the trick is actually very dangerous and could potentially kill him.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="240.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="242.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
