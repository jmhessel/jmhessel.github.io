The joke is unexpected and humorous because of the incongruity between the love/sex symbols in the room and the man's comment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is in the middle of explaining a very serious situation, about being shot by arrows, and then he makes a non-sequitur about his cat being sexy. The juxtaposition of the two thoughts is humorous, especially because it's not clear how the man's cat being sexy is related to him being shot by arrows.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man has been shot with arrows by Cupid, which would traditionally be associated with feeling love. However, the man is instead thinking about how sexy his cat is. This is a non-traditional use of arrows and Cupid, which is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has been shot with arrows by Cupid, which would normally signify that he is in love. However, the man's nonchalant attitude towards the whole situation implies that he does not believe that being shot by arrows signifies love, and instead, he was just thinking about how sexy his cat is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur. The man has just described a series of events that logically lead up to him thinking about how sexy his cat is, but the events themselves (getting shot by arrows) are so unusual that they break the train of thought.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non-sequitur: the man's thoughts about his sexy cat have nothing to do with the fact that he's been shot by arrows. This joke is also funny because it plays on the stereotype that single men who own cats are often seen as lonely and desperate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's over-the-top reaction to being shot by multiple arrows is disproportionate to the event. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the phrase "love is blind," which is often used to describe people who are in love and don't see their partner's faults. In this case, the man is "blind" to the fact that his cat is not actually sexy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's 100% nonchalant reaction to being shot by multiple arrows, a potentially deadly situation, is contrasted with the therapist's rapt attention. The joke could also be interpreted as saying that love makes you blind, which is why the man is fine despite being shot.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the Cupid and the arrows with the man's mundane train of thought; his though about his sexy cat is much more normal than being shot by Cupid's arrows. The arrows signify feelings of love or desire, which makes the man's thought about his cat seem even more absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected and a bit risque. It's unexpected because, in the context of the situation, the man is talking about being shot with arrows, which is a very serious matter. However, the man's nonchalant attitude towards the arrows and cupid's anger suggests that this might be a common occurrence. The joke is also funny because it's a bit risque because the man is talking about his cat being sexy, which is not something that you would typically discuss with your therapist.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is talking about how he realized how sexy his cat is, but he is saying it in a Neuroscience context. The man has been shot with arrows, which are associated with love and Cupid, so the joke is that he is only now realizing how sexy his cat is because he is under the influence of love.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur. The man has been shot by multiple arrows, presumably by Cupid, and is angry about it. The therapist is trying to understand what might have caused the situation, and the man's only response is to talk about his cat. The joke is funny because it's completely unrelated to the situation at hand.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur: the man has been shot by arrows and is in pain, yet he's thinking about his cat being sexy. The joke is also funny because it's unexpected: one would expect the man to be talking about his love life and why cupid is angry with him, yet the man's thoughts are entirely unrelated to the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because most people think of Cupid as being a cute baby, not a sexy one. The man's thoughts about his cat being sexy implies that he found the baby Cupid to be sexy, which is unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has just been shot with arrows by Cupid, the god of love. The man's comment about his cat being sexy is a non-sequitur, but it's humorous because the cat is the only thing he can think about in the moment. The man is either so in love that he can't think straight, or the pain from the arrows is making him delirious.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="154.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="156.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
