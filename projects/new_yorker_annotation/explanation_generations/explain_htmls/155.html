The joke is also amusing because it's a play on words; the couple is asking the woman why she honked if she loves whales, and the woman is asking the couple why they have a bumper sticker about whales if they don't actually love them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple has a bumper sticker that says "I love whales." This is a pun on the common bumper sticker that reads "I love (heart) New York." The couple probably got the bumper sticker because they like whales, but the joke is that they literally have a whale in their car.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple in the car has a bumper sticker that says "No whale left behind." The couple is now faced with the reality of having to take the whale with them, which was not what they intended when they got the sticker. The sticker is meant to be ironic, since they are now actually going to have to leave a whale behind.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully pokes fun at those who have bumper stickers that say things like "Save the Whales" or "I Love Whales." The joke is that, if you truly love whales, you wouldn't put one in the backseat of your car out of its natural habitat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The couple has a bumper sticker that says "Save the Whales." But, in this case, they have an actual whale in their car, which goes against the message of saving whales by not hunting them. The joke is also clever because it's a non-verbal way of asking the couple why they have the whale in their car.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people in the car were probably unaware that there was a whale in the backseat until after they had gotten into the car. The fact that they have a bumper sticker that says "I love whales" is ironic, given the current situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the whale in the backseat is a reference to the "free Willy" campaign to release whales from captivity. The joke is that, despite the fact that the people in the car are driving a whale, they don't appear to be part of the campaign to set him free. The humor comes from the incongruity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the car is asking the woman why she put a bumper sticker that says "I <3 Whales" on the back of their car, given that they now have an actual whale in the backseat. The joke is clever because it's a pun: the bumper sticker originally said "I love whales" but with the whale in the backseat, it now says "I [heart] whales".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The bumper sticker on the car says "I whale always love you" which is a pun on the phrase "I will always love you". In this context, the joke is funny because the person driving the car has a whale in the backseat, which is obviously not something that one would expect.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people in the car with the whale have a bumper sticker that reads "I brake for whales." This is a common bumper sticker for people who are environmentally conscious and want to save whales. However, the joke is that the people have actually gone one step further and picked up a whale! The bumper sticker is ironic because it's supposed to signify that the driver will go out of their way to not hit a whale with their car, but in this case, they literally picked one up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple has a bumper sticker that says "I'm with whale." The sticker is usually seen on cars that have a political bumper sticker supporting a certain candidate. In this situation, the couple doesn't have a political candidate they are supporting; they literally have a whale in their car. The joke is clever because it's a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple's car has a bumper sticker that says "I (heart) whales". They are being ironic because they have a whale in their car, which goes against everything that reduce, reuse, recycle bumper stickers stand for. Instead of releasing the whale back into the ocean, they have chosen to keep it in their car.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common bumper sticker that says "save the whales." The couple in the car has a whale in the backseat, which goes against the message of the bumper sticker. The joke is clever because it's a pun: the couple "saved" the whale by putting it in their car, but they are contributing to the whale's demise by not letting it live in its natural habitat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple's car has a bumper sticker that reads "I <3 whale," but the whale is now in the car with them and is taking up a lot of space. The joke is clever because it playfully pokes fun at how couples often have bumper stickers or other expressions of their love for each other, but in this case, the couple's love for whales has become a bit too literal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple's car has a bumper sticker that says "I <3 Whales." The joke implies that they put the sticker on the car before they had the whale in the backseat, which means they must have wanted a whale. But having a whale in the backseat is impractical, to say the least, so the joke is poking fun at their seeminglymessage.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="154.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="156.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
