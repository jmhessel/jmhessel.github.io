The mobster is telling him that this is his last chance to come clean, meaning to confess whatever it is that he did wrong. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the man is about to be killed by being put in cement shoes and thrown into a river, so the mobster is telling him that he needs to come clean before he is submerged in water and his fate is sealed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man tied up in the bucket is being threatened with death by drowning unless he tells the mobster what he wants to know, but the phrase "come clean" can also mean to confess or to tell the truth. So the mobster is both literally and figuratively telling the man to come clean.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In this case, "come clean" refers to both telling the truth (i.e., confessing to a crime) and taking a shower. The man is giving the boy one last chance to confess before he kills him (presumably by cementing his feet in the bucket and leaving him to drown in the tub), but the boy is too afraid to take the opportunity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the mobster is using a play on words. The man who is tied up is in a shower, which is a common place to "come clean" or wash oneself. However, the fact that he is in a bucket with cement shoes means that he is likely going to be "cleaned up" in a more permanent way --- he is going to be killed and his body disposed of by being sunk in the ocean with cement shoes.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the mobster is giving the man who is tied up a chance to "come clean" or confess to whatever crime he's accused of before he's cemented into his shoes and thrown into the Hudson River. Of course, the man being tied up in the bathtub with a shower running is also a play on the phrase "to come clean," as in to wash oneself clean.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of the word "clean": in this context, the man smoking in the bathroom is telling the boy to tell him everything (i.e., come clean), but the boy is also in a shower and so he's literally trying to get clean. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the phrase "come clean" typically means to tell the truth, but in this context, the boy is being told to come clean in the sense of getting cleaned up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man who is tied up and in the bucket is being given a chance to "come clean" by telling the mobster what he knows. However, the man is also in a bathtub which is filling up with water, and if he does not tell the mobster what he knows, he will be "cleaned" (i.e., killed) in the cement shoes.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while showering is often seen as a time to "come clean" or wash away dirt and grime, in this case, the man in the shower is actually being "cleaned" in a much more literal sense. The mobster is giving him one last chance to come clean (i.e., confess) before he ties him up and kills him in the cement-filled shower.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is in a shower, which is typically associated with cleaning oneself, but in this case, the mobster is giving him one last chance to "come clean" before he kills him. The shower is, therefore, a ironic metaphor for the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is telling the boy that this is his "last chance" to come clean, but he is also in a shower which is traditionally where people "come clean." The man is also a gangster, which adds another layer of meaning to the joke, as "coming clean" can also refer to confessing to a crime.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is literally being cleaned (in the shower) but he is also being given a chance to "come clean" and confess whatever it is he has done wrong. Of course, if he doesn't confess, he will be killed anyway --- but the play on words is still funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is tied up is in a precarious position. He is in a tub that is slowly filling with water and he is wearing cement shoes, which would make it very difficult for him to escape. The mobster is telling him that this is his last chance to come clean, meaning to confess to whatever crime he is being accused of.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is smoking in the bathroom and the boy is tied up in the tub with water spraying on him. The man is telling the boy that this is his last chance to "come clean," which could mean either to confess or to take a shower. In this case, it's a double meaning because both the boy and the room need to be cleaned.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is telling the boy that this is his last chance to "come clean" before he kills him. However, the boy is already in a shower, so he is technically "coming clean" already. The man's threat is thus irony.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The boy is in a tub with water spraying on him, which is usually a pleasurable experience, but in this case it is not because the boy is tied up. The man smoking is likely a gangster, and he is telling the boy that this is his "last chance to come clean" before he kills him. The joke is clever because it is both a play on the boy being in a shower, and also a play on the phrase "to come clean," which means to confess or tell the truth.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
