The Senate Committee on Women's Health is a real committee, but in this joke, it's implied that the all-male group of clones is the committee. This is a jab at the lack of progress women have made in the political sphere, especially in terms of reproductive health.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that there are often too many people in the Senate (or in Congress in general), and that they often take a long time to get anything done. In this case, the clones represent the senators, and the woman on the phone is waiting for them to finish so that she can get through.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Senate Committee on Women's Health is a real committee, and its members are all women. In this context, the joke is making a play on words, because the word "senate" can refer to a group of people (in this case, women) or a room in which a group meets (in this case, the men who all look alike). So, the joke is saying that the Senate Committee on Women's Health is getting out of the room, because the men who all look alike are coming in.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is impossible for there to be an identical crowd of men, yet the woman on the phone is not surprised. She is instead waiting for the Senate Committee on Women's Health to leave, which is a group of people that is mostly composed of women. The joke implies that the identical crowd of men are clones, and the woman is waiting for them to leave so she can have the room to herself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is on the phone with someone, potentially a reporter, and she's about to be interrupted by a bunch of men who look exactly the same. The joke is clever because it plays on the fact that " cloning " often refers to copying something exactly, and in this case, the clones are of men, making a Senate Committee on Women's Health irrelevant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the term "clone army", which is often used to describe a group of people who look identical. In this case, the "clone army" is actually a group of Senators on the Senate Committee on Women's Health, which is a real committee. The joke is clever because it imagines a world where human cloning is possible, and makes a political commentary about the lack of gender diversity on Senate committees.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The women is on the phone with the Senate Committee on Women's Health, which is a group of people who would be discussing issues related to women's health, such as cloning. The fact that all the men look the same is a play on the fact that clones are identical, which is why they are called clones.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the presence of so many male clones in one place is unusual, and the fact that they are all exact replicas of each other is even more unusual. The joke cleverly plays on the fact that, in the United States Senate, there is a Senate Committee on Women's Health, which would likely be composed entirely of women. The presence of the clones in the office thus suggests that there is some sort of parallel universe where men are the ones who are oppressed and women are the ones in power.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is on the phone with someone discussing an important meeting, and she's interrupted by a group of men who look identical. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the "Senate Committee on Women's Health" is a real thing, but in this context, it's also a group of women who look identical, which is a pun on the word "clone."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at the Senate's lack of progress in recent years on addressing women's health care needs. The joke is also funny because it's unexpected: the reader might think that the woman on the phone is going to say something about the men being clones, but instead she makes a joke about the Senate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The "Senate Committee on Women's Health" is a real thing, but in this context, it's a group of cloned women who are being released into the room. The joke is clever because it's both a play on words and a play on the concept of clones: the cloned women are all identical, just like the cloned men, but they are also individuals who are on a committee, suggesting that they are not just mindless copies.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is staring at a bunch of identical men, and her response is to say that she's on the phone with the Senate Committee on Women's Health. This implies that the women's health committee is made up entirely of clones, which is a silly idea.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the stereotype that women are more interested in gossiping than men. In this case, the woman is talking on the phone about the clones that have just entered the room, rather than paying attention to the Senate committee that is getting out. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words --- the Senate committee is literally getting out of the room, but the woman is more interested in the clones, which are also figuratively getting out, i.e., becoming more visible.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in the U.S. Senate, the Senate Committee on Women's Health is a real committee that deals with issues related to women's health. However, the clones depicted in the scene are all men, so the joke is that the woman ismistakenly assuming that the clones are women who are members of the committee.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cloning of the men in the Senate Committee on Women's Health implies that they are not taking the issue of women's health seriously. This joke also highlights the absurdity of having an all-male committee on women's health in the first place.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="113.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="115.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
