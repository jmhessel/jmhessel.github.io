However, the joke is also funny because knights are usually imagined as being handsome, young men, so the fact that this knight is middle-aged is unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is on a date with a man who is dressed as a knight. The contrast between the formal, old-fashioned clothing and the modern day setting is what makes it funny. The woman's comment implies that she wouldn't normally date someone who is significantly older than her, but she makes an exception for the knight.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is drinking with a "knight," but she is also talking about how she doesn't normally date men who are middle-aged. The word "knight" can refer to both a medieval warrior and a man who is honorable and virtuous, which is why the woman is talking about how she doesn't normally date men who are middle-aged.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the suit of armor is probably not actually middle-aged, but the suit of armor makes him look much older than he actually is. The woman's joke is a play on words: not only is she saying that she usually avoids dating older men, but she's also saying that she usually avoids dating knights (i.e., men in armor).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is not actually interested in the knight, despite his courting efforts. She's trying to let him down easy by saying she normally wouldn't date someone his age, when in reality, she wouldn't date him because he's from a different time period.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is not only rejecting the knight's advances, but she's doing so in a way that's anachronistic. In the context of the situation, she's saying she doesn't date men from the Middle Ages --- but, of course, in the present day, knights don't exist, so she's technically saying she doesn't date men at all.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is quipping about how the knight is old-fashioned and not up-to-date with current dating trends. It's also funny because, in a way, the woman herself is out of date --- in medieval times, it would have been completely normal for a woman to date a much older man, as knights were often married to noblewomen who were much younger than them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is not only having drinks with a man who is from the Middle Ages, but she is also sitting next to a picture of him from that time period. She is surprised that she is attracted to him, given that he is much older than her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in the suit of armor looks like he could be middle-aged, even though he's probably not. The joke is also funny because people usually don't go on dates in suits of armor, so it's surprising that the person would even show up to the date in that outfit.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is on a date with a man who is dressed as a knight. The woman is either joking or mistaken in her assumption that the man is middle-aged, because in most cases, people who dress up as knights are either doing it for a living (e.g., at a Renaissance Faire) or are children.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in the suit of armor looks like he's past his prime, which is typically associated with the Middle Ages. Thus, the joke is that the person wouldn't normally date someone who looks like they're from the Middle Ages.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the suit of armor looks like he could be middle-aged, and the woman he's on a date with appears to be disappointed by that fact. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the woman isn't actually saying that she doesn't date men who are physically middle-aged, but rather, that she doesn't date men who are from the Middle Ages.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The person in the suit of armor looks like he could be from the Middle Ages, which is why the other person says she doesn't date men from that time period. However, the suit of armor is also a symbol of chivalry and being a "knight in shining armor," which is something that women often want in a partner. So, despite not wanting to date someone from the Middle Ages, she is ironically on a date with a man who embodies that ideal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in the suit of armor looks like he is from the Middle Ages, which is not the era that the other person is accustomed to dating.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
