The therapist is saying that it's normal to feel empty after a relationship ends, but the banana on the couch is a symbol of how she is the only one in the room, and thus feeling empty is normal for her situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is treating the banana peel as if it is a person going through a tough break-up. This is absurd because banana peels cannot feel emotions. The therapist is either confused or pretending that the banana peel is a person for her own amusement.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is treating the banana peel as if it were a person who has gone through a break-up. Talking to a banana peel is akin to talking to a wall, i.e., it's pointless because the banana peel cannot understand or respond. The therapist is trying to help the banana peel, but her efforts are futile.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "Going through a rough patch" which is commonly used to describe a difficult moment in someone's life. In this case, the therapist is talking to a banana peel, which has just been split (presumably from the banana inside) and is now empty. The therapist is trying to normalize the feelings of the banana peel, which is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is trying to normalize the fact that her patient (the banana) is feeling empty after being split in half. This is absurd because the banana is not a sentient being, and thus cannot feel emotions like emptiness.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully pokes at the stereotype of therapists as being out-of-touch with reality. The joke implies that the therapist is so out-of-touch that she does not even realize her patient has left, and instead attributes the feeling of emptiness to the aftermath of a romantic breakup. The irony is that the therapist is correct in her assessment, but for the wrong reasons.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is normalizing the feeling of emptiness that the patient (the banana) is experiencing after a split (being peeled). The therapist is saying that it's normal to feel that way, even though the patient is a banana, which isn't a person. The joke is a play on the fact that often, therapists will normalize their patients' feelings in order to make them feel better.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is treating the banana peel as if it were a person who has just gone through a break-up, even though it is clear that the banana peel cannot feel any emotions. The therapist is trying to apply classic break-up advice to the banana peel, which doesn't work because the banana peel cannot understand or feel anything.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a play on words. In this case, the "split" refers to both the breakup of a romantic relationship and the act of cutting a banana in half length-wise. The therapist is saying that it's normal to feel empty after a breakup, but the joke is that the therapist is also saying that it's normal to feel empty after cutting a banana in half.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In this case, the "split" refers to both the break-up of a relationship, which can leave someone feeling emotionally empty, and the physical act of splitting a banana in half, which leaves the peel empty. The psychiatrist's office is empty because there is no patient, which is also a play on the fact that the couch is empty except for the banana peel.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The psychiatrist is telling the banana that it is normal to feel empty after a split, meaning after being peeled. The banana is peel is Split, meaning a type of banana, but it can also mean to divide something in two, which is what happens when a banana is peeled. So the psychiatrist is saying that it is normal for the banana to feel empty after it has been peeled, because it has been Split in two.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the psychiatrist is saying something that is true for most people in a situation that is not normal. While it's normal to feel empty after a romantic relationship ends, it's not normal to have a banana as your only patient. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the banana is "split" (divided in half), and the patient is "empty" (feeling emotionally hollow).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The therapist is talking to a banana peel, which has just been split open, and the banana has been eaten. The therapist is giving advice about feeling empty after a split, but in this case, the split is literal, and the banana peel is, in fact, empty.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The psychiatrists says it's normal to feel empty after a "split," which could mean either a breakup or literally splitting a banana open. In either case, the banana is a symbol of something that was once whole and complete, but is now empty.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is treating the banana peel as if it were a person who had just gone through a bad breakup. The therapist is trying to be sympathetic, but the Banana peel cannot feel anything, so it is insensitive and absurd.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="91.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="93.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
