The word "garage" can refer to both a place to store a car, or a type of beer. In this case, the man is saying that he's sorry about the cat destroying the garage (i.e., the place to store a car), but the cat is actually destroying a can of beer (i.e., a type of garage).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's explanation for the giant cat outside is that it is their pet that is going to be declawed. The joke is funny because it is a play on words --- "declawed" can mean to have one's nails removed, but it can also mean to have one's power removed. In this case, the giant cat outside is so big and powerful that the only way to "remove its power" is to declaw it, i.e., to have its nails removed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is apologizing for the destruction the giant cat has caused (i.e., the cat ate his garage), but the fact that he is having the cat declawed tomorrow implies that the cat is a pet. This juxtaposition is funny because it is unexpected and creates a incongruity.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="91.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="93.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
