"International waters" usually refers to the body of water that exists between two countries, over which each country has sovereign jurisdiction. In this case, the "international waters" the shark is referring to is the water inside of the interrogation room: because the room is inside of a police station, it is effectively sovereign territory, and the shark is claiming jurisdiction over it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is technically correct: if the shark was in international waters when it committed the crime, then it would be outside of the jurisdiction of the police. However, the joke is also funny because it's absurd to think that a shark would be intelligent enough to commit a crime, let alone be aware of the concept of international waters.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The term "international waters" usually refers to a body of water that isn't under the jurisdiction of any one country, and is considered to be open to all. In this case, the "international waters" the shark is referring to is the ocean, which is its natural habitat. The joke is clever because it's a way for the shark to weasel its way out of the interrogation by playing on the fact that it's not a human and thus isn't subject to the same laws.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cops are interrogating the shark about a crime, and the shark is telling them that it was in international waters when the crime occurred. This is a play on the common phrase "in international waters" meaning that something is beyond the jurisdiction of any one country. In this case, the crime the shark is being interrogated for occurred in international waters, meaning that the cops have no jurisdiction and thus no case.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. When someone is caught committing a crime, they might say that they were in international waters, i.e., beyond the jurisdiction of the country's laws. However, in this case, the shark actually was in international waters when it committed the crime, because it's a shark and sharks live in the ocean. The officers are attempting to interrogate the shark to find out what it did, but the shark is nonchalantly playing the fact that it's a shark to get out of trouble.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-answer to the question of whether or not the shark committed a crime. The shark is clearly in the wrong here, being on land and in a police interrogation room, but it's try to weasel its way out of trouble by saying it was in international waters when the crime was committed. This is a classic case of someone trying to weasel their way out of a tricky situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "international waters" typically refers to an area of water where no one country has jurisdiction. However, in this context, the phrase takes on a different meaning: the shark is saying that he was in the water where he belongs, and so the cops have no right to detain him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is telling the shark that it's in trouble because it was in international waters when it committed the crime, implying that the shark is being arrested for a crime that it committed in the ocean. This is silly because, while sharks are often feared because they are predators, they are not usually thought of as criminals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that sharks are often found in international waters, where they are not subject to the jurisdiction of any one country. In this case, the shark is being interrogated for a crime it committed in international waters, where it is not subject to the jurisdiction of the police department. As such, the cops are angry because they can't do anything to the shark.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is asking the shark about a crime he committed, and the shark is trying to jurisdictional law to weasel his way out of it. The cop is incredulous because the shark is claiming that the crime he committed was in international waters, which is ridiculous because it would be impossible for the shark to have committed the crime if he was in international waters (since he can only survive in water).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is telling the shark that it's in trouble for being in international waters, which is where sharks are typically found. The joke is clever because, while the cop is technically correct, the shark being in international waters is not actually a crime.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two police officers are interrogating the shark about a crime it committed, but the shark is telling them that it committed the crime in international waters, which means that the police have no jurisdiction. This is a play on the stereotype that sharks are dangerous criminals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the interrogation room is on land, the cop says that the shark is in "international waters". This is a play on the fact that sharks are often found in the ocean, and thus are not subject to the laws of any one country. However, the cop is implying that, even though the interrogation room is on land, the shark is still in international waters, and thus not subject to the laws of the country.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The cop is saying that the shark was in international waters, meaning that it wasn't in the jurisdiction of the police department, so the shark can't be interrogated. However, the term "international waters" can also be used to describe the open ocean, which is the natural habitat of sharks. So, the cop is saying that the shark was in its natural habitat, and therefore, it can't be interrogated.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "international waters" is usually used to describe areas of the ocean where any country's laws do not apply. In contrast, the interrogation room is a place where the laws of the country do apply. Therefore, the shark is saying that he did nothing wrong because he was in a place where the law does not apply to him.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="85.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="87.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
