However, by having the chairs in a line, it gives people a sense of hierarchy, with the person's boss being more important than him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man behind the desk is trying to explain why he moved the chairs into a line instead of having them in a semicircle. He says it's because having them in a semicircle gave people a sense of equality, which is ironic because a line implies that the person at the front is better than the people at the back. In a semicircle, everyone is equal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the semicircle is a traditional set up for a meeting, with the boss at the front and everyone else seated around in a semi-circle, which implies that the boss is speaking to them as equals. However, by having too many chairs, it makes it clear that the boss does not see the people in the office as equals, which is why they are all lined up in a row.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's boss is in a position of authority over him, yet the man has him arranged in a line of chairs that makes it look like he's in a position of authority over his co-workers. The joke subverts the usual power dynamic in an office by having the man's boss be in a subordinate position.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the setting: it's unusual for there to be a row of chairs in an office, and it's even more unusual for the CEO to be sitting at the back of the line. The joke is a commentary on the equality that is supposed to exist in the workplace, but doesn't always.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is talking about how he used to have the chairs in a semicircle, but he changed it because it made people feel too equal. The Boss is in a position of power, and by moving the chairs so that there is a more clear line of authority, he is able to maintain that power dynamic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because having all the chairs in a semicircle would give people a sense of equality, which is the opposite of what the boss wants. The boss wants people to feel unequal, with the fewer chairs, so that they will be more deferential to the boss.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruency between the man's position of power as a CEO and his absurd method of trying to keep order in his office by having people sit in a line of chairs. The joke implies that the man is more concerned with maintaining an appearance of authority, rather than actually being effective.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's boss is sitting far away from him in a line of chairs, which suggests that the boss is not very fond of him. The joke is a play on words because the man says "semicircle," which usually implies a half-circle shape, but in this case the "semi" refers to the fact that there are only six chairs between him and the boss, not a full circle of chairs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity between the normal behavior in an office (working hard to get ahead, being competitive, etc.) and the man's boss having so many chairs between them. This joke pokes fun at the idea of a boss being overly-concerned with their own authority and power.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. Semicircle suggests that the people in the chairs were lined up in a half-circle around the desk, which would usually denote some sort of waiting area, like in a doctor's office. However, the man says that he had them in a semicircle, which suggests that he was the one sitting in the middle of the half-circle. This would be an unusual way to arrange a meeting, and the joke pokes fun at the CEO's authority.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man behind the desk is talking about how he had the chairs arranged in a semicircle, but he switched to a line because it gave people a sense of equality. However, the fact that the man is sitting at the back of the line suggests that the man does not believe in equality. Thus, the joke is cleverly making a point about how the man's actions are not consistent with his beliefs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man behind the desk is talking about the arrangement of the chairs in the office, which used to be in a semicircle. The man is joking that the reason he changed the arrangement was because the semicircle made people feel too equal. The joke is clever because it's a play on the word "semicircle," which has the double meaning of half of a circle and a social class that is lower than the upper class but higher than the working class.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man's boss is asking why he has so many chairs in his office, and the man replies that he used to have them in a semicircle, but that arrangement gave people a sense of equality. The boss is likely taken aback by the man's frankness, not expecting him to admit that he was trying to create a power dynamic in his office.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the traditional corporate power structure, where the boss sits at the front of the room and the employees sit in a row facing the boss. In this case, the boss has moved the chairs into a semicircle, which would give the employees a sense of equality, but the boss doesn't want that because it would reduce his power.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="7.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="9.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
