The car on the couch is presumably there because it is experiencing some sort of emotional distress, and so the therapist is telling it that its problem is not as big as it thinks it is. However, the word "dipstick" can also be used as a derogatory term for a stupid or incompetent person. So, the therapist could also be saying that the car is stupid and its problem is not as big as it thinks it is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. A "dipstick" can refer to a rod that is inserted into a car's engine to measure the oil level, but it can also be used as a slang term for a stupid or crazy person.

The therapist is trying to say that sometimes people over-analyze things, and that sometimes a dipstick (a rod used to measure the level of oil in a car) is just a dipstick. However, the fact that she's saying this to a car makes the joke funnier, because it's literally true that a dipstick is just a dipstick to a car.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="7.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="9.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
