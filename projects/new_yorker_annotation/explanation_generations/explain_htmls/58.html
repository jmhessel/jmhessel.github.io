He thinks they are carrying the snake to be used as a stakeholder in a business meeting, when in reality they are just carrying a snake.

He thinks they are saying they need more "stakeholders," when in fact they are saying they need "more snakes." This joke could be funnier if the man who misunderstood was someone with a lot of power in the office, such as a CEO or manager.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is looking at the two men carrying the snake is confusing the word "snake" with the word "stakeholder." A stakeholder is someone with a vested interest in a company, usually meaning they own shares. The joke is clever because it's a play on words, and also because it's a situation where someone is misunderstanding what another person is saying.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="57.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="59.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
