The Roman numerals "CX" and "XXV" sound similar, but they mean different things: "CX" means "centuries," while "XXV" means "25." In other words, the joke is saying that the person will have to explain to the judge why he was racing in a horse and buggy (CX), not a sports car (XXV). The joke is clever because it's a play on words, but it's also a bit of a criticism of racing in horse and buggies, which is anachronistic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is anachronistic. The Roman Centurion is telling the woman to get in the chariot so she can go to court and explain why she was driving a car in a horse and buggy. The Centurion is telling her to use the chariot to get to court, which is a mode of transportation from a much earlier time period.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a XXV is a Roman chariot, and CX is an abbreviation for "chariot-racing." The woman is being ticketed for speeding, and the Centurion is telling her that she can explain to the judge why she was racing a chariot. The joke is a play on words, as the XXV is also the Roman numerals for 25, which is the speeds in kilometers per hour that the woman was driving.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "CX" is a type of horse carriage, and "XXV" is a type of sports car. So the man is saying that the woman can tell the judge why she was driving a sports car in a horse and buggy. This is funny because it's amix-up of two very different types of transportation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is being directed by the Centurion to a horse-drawn carriage, rather than a car. The Roman numerals in the joke are the standard way of denoting numerals in a horse-and-buggy (XXV) versus a car (CX). The joke is therefore pointing out the anachronism of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is absurd: a woman is being pulled over by a Centurion in a chariot for driving a car. The Centurion is telling her that she can explain to the judge why she was driving a car instead of a horse and buggy. This is funny because it's anachronistic: the judge would be just as confused as the Centurion is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Centurion is directing the woman to a horse and buggy instead of a car. This is a play on words, because in Roman numerals, "CX" is the number 110, and "XXV" is the number 25. So, the joke is that the Centurion is telling the woman to go talk to the judge about why she was driving so slowly (25 miles per hour) in a car (110 miles per hour).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Centurion is telling the woman to get in the chariot, which is a horse-drawn carriage, rather than the car. The joke is a play on words, as "CX" is Roman numerals for "100" and "XXV" is Roman numerals for "25." The joke implies that the woman was doing something illegal (100 is a high number) and that the Centurion is telling her to tell the judge (25) why she was doing it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The Roman numerals for 25 are "XXV," and "CX" is the Roman numeral for 100. So, the joke is that the person was driving 100 miles per hour in a 25 mile per hour zone. The Centurian is telling the person to explain to the judge why they were driving so fast, implying that they will get in trouble.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The Roman numerals "CX" and "XXV" refer to the Centurian and the chariot, respectively. However, the words "CX" can also refer to a bicycle race, and "XXV" can refer to a sports car. So, the joke is that the person was racing their car in a chariot, which is clearly not allowed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in armor is talking to the woman about why he was caught driving a horse and buggy (CX) on the street (XXV). He's trying to say that it's a legitimate form of transportation, but the judge will see it as a speeding offense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in armor is clearly from a time period where horse drawn carriages were common, and thus he is surprised to see a modern car. He is asking the woman why she is driving a car that is sports car, or "CX," when she could have been driving a horse drawn carriage, or "XXV." The joke cleverly uses the Roman numerals for each to create a pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words.

The Roman numerals "CX" and "XXV" represent the numbers "100" and "25" respectively. The Centurian is telling the woman that she can explain to the judge (100) why she was driving so fast (25). The joke is clever because it's a double pun: not only is the Centurian telling the woman to explain herself to the judge, but he is also telling her to explain why she was driving so fast in a car.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="57.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="59.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
