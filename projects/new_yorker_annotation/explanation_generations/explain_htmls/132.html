This is a play on the fact that salmon is often served fresh, as in, recently caught. In this case, the salmon would be very fresh because it was just brought in by the bear.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is more concerned with the quality of the food than the fact that there is a bear in the restaurant. The bear is out of place and is a potentially dangerous animal, but the man is only worried about whether or not the salmon is fresh. This shows how ridiculous it is to worry about such a trivial thing when there is a much bigger issue at hand.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="131.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="133.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
