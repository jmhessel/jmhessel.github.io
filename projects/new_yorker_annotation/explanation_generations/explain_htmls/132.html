The man in the business suit is hoping to take advantage of the man in the desert by billing him for the mirage, which is something that's not actually real.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the suit is saying that the man crawling in the desert is a mirage, and thus, not real. This is a play on words because "mirage" can also mean an illusion, something that is not really there. In this case, the man in the suit is saying that the man crawling is an illusion created by the heat, and therefore, not real, and thus, not billable (meaning, the man in the suit won't have to pay for him).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the businessman is telling the man in the desert that the desert mirage he's seeing, of an oasis, is billable. In other words, the man in the desert will have to pay for the privilege of seeing the oasis. This is absurd because, of course, the oasis isn't real, and thus the businessman can't charge for it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the suit is a lawyer, and he is billing his time during the mirage. The other man is presumably his client, who is unaware that the man in the suit is taking advantage of him. The lawyer is exploiting the fact that the man is seeing a mirage, which is a hallucination brought on by dehydration.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the suit is a lawyer, and he is billing the man in the desert for the time he is spending talking to him. The man in the desert is seeing a mirage, and the lawyer is taking advantage of him by charging him for it. This is a play on the phrase "billable hours."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the suit is acting like he's seeing a business opportunity in the other man's dire situation. The man in the suit is billing the other man for the mirage, which is something that's not real. In other words, he's trying to take advantage of the other man's thirst and desperation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the suit is a lawyer, and he is billing the man in the desert for the mirage. This is a play on words, because "billable hours" are the hours that lawyers charge their clients for, and a "mirage" is an illusion. Thus, the lawyer is saying that the mirage is real, and the man in the desert is paying for it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while a business person might be willing to take advantage of a stranded person in the desert by charging them for help, the business person in this case is willing to take advantage of the stranded person by billing them for a mirage. The stranded person is in a dire enough position that they might actually believe that the business person could help them, even though all they would be getting is an illusion.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the businessman is billing the other man for the mirage, which is something that isn't real. The joke implies that the man in the desert is so thirsty that he's hallucinating, and the businessman is taking advantage of that by charging him for the imaginary oasis.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in the business world, time is money and so is water in the desert. Thus, the businessman seeing the mirage of the water is trying to make a joke that he can charge the man for seeing the mirage, because it's just business.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of a businessperson being in the middle of the desert, it's absurd to think that they would be able to bill someone for seeing a mirage. This makes it a play on words, as the businessperson is saying that the mirage is something that can be charged for, which is not possible.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in a business setting, if you have to travel to meet with a client, your company will reimburse you for the cost of the travel. However, if you're seeing a mirage, it's not actually real, so the company wouldn't actually have to reimburse you for anything. The businessman in the suit is saying that even though the man in the desert is just seeing a mirage, he will bill the company for it anyways.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the suit is a mirage, which is an optical illusion caused by the heat in the desert. However, because he's a mirage, he's not real and so the man dying of thirst can't actually get any water from him. The joke is that the mirage is trying to charge the man for the water, even though it's not real and the man is going to die anyway.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it seems like the man in the suit is from a law firm and he's calmly miraging the man who is dying of thirst. The joke is funny because it's a play on words--the man in the suit is billing the man for the mirage, as if it's a service. This is ironic because, typically, a mirage is something that's not real, and so it's not something that can be billed for.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The businessman is in the desert, and he sees a mirage, which is an optical illusion caused by the desert heat. However, he billing the man for the mirage, as if it's a service. This is funny because it's unlikely that anyone would be able to bill for a mirage.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="131.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="133.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
