The joke is made funnier by the fact that the whale is a sperm whale, which is a land mammal. The joke is clever because it plays on the fact that whales are often associated with the ocean (because they live in it), but sperm whales are actually more closely related to land mammals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it seems like the woman in the car is scolding her husband for going on a "surfari" --- a surfing trip --- without her. However, the fact that there is a whale in the backseat suggests that the husband went on a whale-watching trip instead, and brought the whale home with him. The wife is surprised because her husband went on a different kind of trip than she thought, and also because there is a whale in the car.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "surfaris," is a combination of the words "surf" and "safaris." A safari is usually an expedition to go see animals in their natural habitat. In this case, the person in the car is driving on the road and sees a whale, which is not in its natural habitat. The joke is clever because it's a play on words and a play on the idea of seeing animals in their natural habitat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually when someone talks about a "safari," they are referring to a trip to Africa to see exotic animals in their natural habitat. In this case, the person in the car is joking that they are on a safari to see a whale, but they are actually in the ocean near where whales live. The joke is a play on words, as the word "safari" can also refer to a journey or expedition, and the person in the car is clearly on a journey to find a whale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the couple went on a whale watching tour ("surfaris"), but instead of just seeing whales from the boat, they caught one and brought it home with them. This is absurd because whales are very large animals that cannot survive outside of water for long, and so it would be impossible to catch and transport a whale without killing it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the car is scolding the woman for going on "surfaris," which are a type of vacation where people go to surf, but in this case, the woman has come back from her vacation with an actual whale in the car.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The couple is on a "surfaris", which is usually a vacation where people go surfing. In this case, the "surfaris" is a trip to see whales. However, instead of seeing whales from a distance, they have an actual whale in their car. This is a play on words because "surfaris" is a misspelling of "surprise", which is what the couple got when they found a whale in their car.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Safari" usually refers to a trip to Africa to see wild animals in their natural habitat. However, in this case, the woman is clearly not happy that the man has brought a whale into the car, and instead of being on a safari to see animals, the man has brought the animal into their car.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is in the ocean, next to a whale, and the whale is in the backseat of their car. The couple is clearly not on a surfari, which is a portmanteau of the words "surfing" and "safari." A safari is an expedition, usually in Africa, to observe animals in their natural habitat. The couple's current location and activity, however, is the opposite of a safari.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is referring to the woman's "surfaris," or surfing excursions, but the woman has substituted a whale for a surfboard. This is humorous because it is a non-traditional item to bring on a surfari, and because it is a very large object that would be difficult to transport.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "surfaris" is a misspelling of the word "safaris," which are trips to go see animals in their natural habitat. The joke implies that the person in the car went on a safari to see a whale, but instead of seeing it in the ocean, they instead find it on the road behind their car. This is humorous because it is a very unusual situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it takes the common phrase "you and your ___" and applies it to an unexpected situation, in which a wife is annoyed at her husband for bringing home a whale in the backseat of their car. The joke is funnier if the reader/listener is familiar with the phrase, as it highlights the incongruity between the phrase and the situation even more.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "surfaris" is a combination of the words "surf" and "safari." In this context, a "surfari" would be a safari where you ride on the back of a whale. However, the fact that there is a whale in the backseat of the car implies that the couple went on a surfing safari, which is a safari where you ride on the waves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "surfaris" is a pun on "safaris." A safari is a trip to go see animals in their natural habitat; in contrast, a surfari is a trip to go see animals out of their natural habitat. The joke is poking fun at the fact that the whale is in the car, which is obviously not its natural habitat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is in a car next to the ocean, but instead of going surfing like one might expect, they have picked up a whale. This is funny because it's unexpected and because whales are so big that it's implausible that they could fit in a car.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="155.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="157.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
