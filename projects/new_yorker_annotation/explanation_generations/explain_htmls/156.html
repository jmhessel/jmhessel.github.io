The joke is clever because the man with the matryoshka dolls is literally inside of another person, so it's possible that he committed the crime.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the detective is trying to solve a case, but the only witness is a man with many matryoshka dolls. The dolls are often used as a metaphor for something being nested or complicated, so the joke is implying that the detective will never be able to solve the case because it's too complicated.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is describing a crime where it's not clear who the perpetrator is. The man she's talking to is a detective, and he has a lot of matryoshka dolls, which are Russian nesting dolls. The fact that he has so many nesting dolls implies that he's very good at solving crimes, because he's able to get to the "inside" or the root of the problem. In this case, the inside job refers to the fact that the perpetrator is still unknown, and the detective hasn't been able to solve the crime.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="155.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="157.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
