The two men are stranded on a deserted island with no food, and they've just realized that the other island they can see is a mirage. The fact that they've already eaten Bob makes it even funnier, as it implies that they sacrificed one of their own for no reason.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the movie "Cast Away," in which a man is stranded on an island with no food. In the movie, the man resorts to eating his companion, who has died, in order to survive. In this situation, the two men have not yet resorted to cannibalism, but are eyeing the other island with the food longingly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The speaker and his companion are stranded on a desert island with no food, and they've just realized that the "island" they thought was nearby was actually a mirage. The Despairing Man wishes they had realized that before eating Bob, because now they've realized that Bob was actually the only food they had.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reverse of the standard situation in which someone is stranded on an island and sees a mirage of an oasis, when in reality there is no oasis. In this case, the men see an island covered in giant candy, but it's really just a mirage, and they've already eaten one of their fellow stranded men.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people on the island are stranded and have presumably resorted to cannibalism to survive. The fact that they didn't realize the island was made of candy before eating the person implies that they were so desperate that they would have eaten anything. The joke is also gruesome and dark, which makes it funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men have been stranded on the island for so long that they've resorted to cannibalism, and they only just now realized that the other island is actually a mirage and not real. The joke is even funnier because the "candy" they thought was on the other island were actually people, and they ate one of them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "I wish we'd thought of that before." Eating Bob implies that the speaker and his fellow castaway resorted to cannibalism to survive on the island, and the person he's talking to only now realizes that they could have just swam to the other island made of candy. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the game Candyland, which is known for being easy and not very challenging.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it's not unusual for people who are stranded on a deserted island to resort to cannibalism, it is unusual for the island to be covered in giant candies and pastries. In other words, the men ate Bob (the other stranded man) because they thought there was nothing else to eat on the island, when in fact, there was an abundance of food. The joke is darkly humorous because it points out the irony and tragedy of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men are stranded on a deserted island, and they only have each other to eat. One man (Bob) has already been eaten, and the other man is regretting not realizing that there were giant candies and pastries on the other island that they could have eaten instead. The joke is also funny because it playfully breaking the fourth wall by acknowledging that the men are stranded on a deserted island in a board game.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "I wish we'd noticed that before" is often used to express regret, e.g., "I wish we'd noticed that the candy was a mirage before eating Bob." In this case, the speaker is expressing regret that they didn't realize the other island was a mirage before eating the companion, Bob. The use of the phrase "eating Bob" is also a play on words, as "eating someone out" is a euphemism for performing oral sex.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men on the island are stuck there because they ate their fellow castaway, Bob. They're only now noticing the other island, which is covered in candy. The joke is clever because it Turn the tables on the situation: instead of being stranded on a deserted island with no food, they're stranded on an island made entirely of food.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the saying "I wish we'd known that before". In this case, the stranded men didn't know that the other island was an illusion, and as a result, they ate their friend Bob, thinking that he was a giant candy. The joke is also clever because it works on multiple levels: not only is it a play on words, but it is also a play on the idea of a mirage, which is an optical illusion.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men are stranded on a desert island and have eaten one of their friends, Bob, in order to survive. The fact that there is an abundance of candy on the other island makes the situation even more absurd, and highlights the desperation of the men.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the island made of candy is a reference to the board game Candy Land, which is a children's game. The game is designed to be easy and fun, with no consequences for losing. The joke implies that, in contrast, being stranded on a real island would be difficult and the stakes would be much higher. Eating Bob refers to the fact that, in order to survive, the stranded men would have to resort to cannibalism.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men have eaten one of their fellow castaways, Bob, and only afterwards realized that the other island was a mirage and didn't actually have giant candy on it. This joke plays on the trope of people stranded on a desert island resorting to cannibalism.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="105.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="107.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
