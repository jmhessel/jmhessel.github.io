The phrase "to have one's head in the clouds" means to be dreamy or unrealistic. However, in this context, the man actually does have his head in the clouds, because he's standing on one. The joke is also funny because it's a pun on the phrase "this takes the cake", meaning this is the most absurd or outlandish thing that has happened.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is hitchhiking in the sky, which is an impossibility. Hitchhiking is commonly associated with people who are dreamers or who have their head in the clouds, and this man takes that to a literal extreme. The joke is also funny because the man is hitchhiking on a cloud, which is a surreal image.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "he's always had his head in the clouds" is a figurative way of saying that the person is not very grounded in reality, and often daydreams. However, in this instance, the man is actually standing on a cloud, which is a very literal way of having one's head in the clouds. This is funny because it is a direct contradiction of the idiomatic phrase.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "He's always had his head in the clouds" is a saying which means that the person is dreamy and not very practical. However, in this case, the man actually does have his head in the clouds, and it is very impractical. The joke is clever because it takes a saying which is not usually meant to be taken literally and applies it to a literal situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the idiom "he's always had his head in the clouds" means that the person is dreamy and not very good at reality. However, in this case, the man really is in the clouds, and it's very strange. The pilots are surprised to see him, and the joke pokes fun at the man's "head in the clouds" habit.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Having your head in the clouds" is a metaphor for being dreamy or disconnected from reality. However, in this case, the man's head is literally in the clouds, which is bizarre and improbable. The joke is clever because it combines the two meanings of the phrase to create a humorous punchline.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "he's always had his head in the clouds." The man in the clouds is actually litterally head in the clouds, and the speaker is surprised to see him up there.

The hitchhiker has "his head in the clouds" meaning he's not thinking clearly, and also because his actual head is in the clouds. The pilots' reaction is one of incredulity because they've never seen anything like it before.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "He's always had his head in the clouds" is a idiom meaning that he's always daydreaming. However, in the literal sense, he does have his head in the clouds - he's standing on one.
