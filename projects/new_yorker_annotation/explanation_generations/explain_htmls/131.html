The moose head is a type of animal that is often mounted on walls in people's homes, similar to the fish in the scene. But because the moose head is not alive, it cannot bite you. The joke is that the man was bitten by the fish, which is alive, and is warning the other man to watch out for the moose head, which is not alive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the fact that the mounted fish is not alive. The moose head in the parlor is also not alive, but it is a more common decoration in homes than a mounted fish. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words: the moose head is not actually in the parlor (the room where the two men are standing), but the moose head is a similar decoration to the mounted fish.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the moose head is a common trophy that is often hung on the wall in hunters' homes. However, the fact that this moose head is alive and biting the man's shirt is unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The mounted fish is actually a moose head, which is a type of deer. The moose head is not alive, but it could still bite if someone was not careful around it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "watch out for the moose head in the parlor" is a warning to be careful of the antlers on a mounted moose head, which could harm someone if they walked into them. In this case, the moose head is replaced with a fish, which is also mounted on the wall. The fact that the man is being bitten by the fish is also strange and unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "moose" can refer to a type of large deer, but it can also refer to a silly or foolish person. In this case, the moose head is a literal moose head, but it is also a metaphor for the foolish man who is being bitten by the fish.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is warning the other man to be careful of the mounted fish, saying that it is just like a moose head that might be in a parlor (a room in a house), which is not alive and therefore not dangerous. However, the fact that the fish is biting the man's arm shows that it is very much alive and dangerous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "moose head" can refer to either a moose head taxidermy (i.e., a dead moose head) or a live moose. In this situation, the moose head is a live moose, and so the man is warning the other man to be careful around it. The joke is effective because it's a combination of the two meanings of "moose head" (live moose vs. dead moose head) which creates a more humorous effect.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The moose head is a taxidermy head of a moose, which is a type of animal. The word "moose" is similar to the word "mousse," which is a type of dessert. The joke is that the man is warning the other man to watch out for the moose head in the room, but he's really warning him to watch out for the dessert.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is warning the other man to be careful of the animal head on the wall, but instead of saying "moose head", he says "mousse head", which is a type of dessert. The man is warning the other man to be careful of the animal head on the wall, but instead of saying "moose head", he says "mousse head", which is a type of dessert.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man getting bitten by the fish is a white-collar worker, and the moose head is another object in the room that could potentially bite him. The joke is that the moose head is more likely to bite him than the fish, because moose are generally more aggressive than fish.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The moose head is a type of game that is hunted and then mounted on the wall like the fish in the scene. So, the man is warning his friend toWatch out for the mounted fish in the living room. But, the moose head is also a type of animal head that is often mounted on the wall as a trophy. So, the man is also warning his friend to watch out for the mounted animal heads in the living room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the situation: a mounted fish, which should be dead, is actually alive and biting a man's suit. The joke is made even funnier by the nonchalant way in which the man warns his companion about the potential danger, as if it's a completely normal thing to have to worry about.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because moose heads are often found in people's homes as taxidermy, and they can appear quite realistic. The man in the scene is warning the other man to be careful around the moose head, as it might bite. The joke is clever because it uses the homophones "moose" and "mouse," which are pronounced the same but have different meanings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The words "moose head" can mean two things: 1) the head of a moose, which would be a dead moose head, or 2) a moose head (the animal), which is alive. In this situation, the moose head is a painting of a moose, which is hanging in the living room next to the fireplace. But, because the fish is alive and taking a bite out of the man's shirt, the moose head could be interpreted as a real, live moose head, which would be very strange (and dangerous) to have in a living room.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
