In this context, "check" can mean two things: the first is the check the waiter will give to the customer at the end of the meal to pay for what they ordered; the second is the "check" or balance the waiter will give to the customer to make sure they are happy with what they ordered. The joke is that the check at the end of the meal will be very large, given the size of the menu.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's huge menu is a metaphor for the bill being very expensive. The waiter is going to be surprised at how much the man's meal costs, just like the man was surprised at how big the menu was.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of the word "check": a "check" can refer to a bill at a restaurant (i.e., what the customer needs to pay), but it can also refer to the menu. Thus, the waiter is saying that the man hasn't seen anything yet (i.e., the bill) and that he should brace himself for the size of it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is holding a menu that is twice his size, and the waiter is standing next to him with a smile on his face. The joke is that the man is going to be surprised when he sees the bill/check for his meal, because it is likely to be more than twice the size of the menu.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. When you "check" something, you look at it to see if it's okay. In this case, the man is telling the waiter to wait until he sees the check --- meaning, the bill at the end of the meal. The joke is that the man is warning the waiter that the bill is going to be expensive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. When the waiter says "wait," he's not only telling the man to be patient, but he's also saying that the man will be charged for his food when he's done eating. The man reading the menu is looking at the prices and is surprised at how expensive it is, so the waiter's comment is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is unexpected. The waiter's comment suggests that the check, or bill, will be similarly large to the menu, and thus be quite expensive. This is unexpected because it is not common for the menu to be larger than the bill.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is clearly taken aback by the size of the menu, and the waiter nonchalantly implying that the check will be even bigger is a clever play on words. The joke is also funny because it's usually the case that the check is much bigger than the menu itself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the menu is so large, the bill is probably going to be large as well. The implication is that the man is going to order a lot of food, and the waiter is going to be stuck with a huge tab. This is ironic because usually, it's the customer who has to pay the bill at the end of the meal, not the waiter.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the check is often more expensive than the actual meal, especially in nicer restaurants. The man's reaction of horror implies that he wasn't expecting the check to be so expensive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the large menu is a metaphor for the expensive bill that the man will receive at the end of his meal. The waiter's smile suggests that he is aware of this and is enjoying the man's discomfort.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's order is going to be very large, and so the check will be very large as well. This is a problem because, often, people want to spend as little money as possible when they are eating out, and so a large check is not desirable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of the word "check": in a normal scenario, the "check" is the bill at the end of the meal. However, in this context, the "check" is the menu, which is enormous. Thus, the waiter is warning the man that the bill is going to be very expensive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it references the fact that, often times, the check (the bill) for a meal at a restaurant is much more expensive than the menu would make it appear. The man reading the menu is unaware of this, and the waiter warns him that he'll be in for a unpleasant surprise when he sees the check.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of the word "check": in a restaurant, the "check" is the bill that the customer has to pay at the end of the meal. However, the word "check" can also refer to something being correct or correctable, as in "I'll need to check that." In this case, the waiter is saying that the customer will be surprised at how much the bill is, i.e., it's going to be quite a shock.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="130.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="132.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
