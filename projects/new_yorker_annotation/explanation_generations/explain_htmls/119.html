However, in this context, "cutting down on the yelling and splashing" means that the beach ball is preventing people from being able to swim and make noise in the pool, as they would be trapped under the ball.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while a pool filled with a beach ball would reduce the amount of yelling and splashing (because people would be more carefully avoiding the ball), it would also create a lot more bouncing and movement, which would likely increase the amount of yelling and splashing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a standard public pool, people would be yelling and splashing around, but the beach ball makes the pool much more calm and subdued. The joke is also clever in that, while a beach ball in a pool might normally be seen as a fun addition, in this case, it's more of a hindrance because it makes the pool less enjoyable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually when people are in a pool, there is a lot of yelling and splashing, but with the beach ball taking up so much space in the pool, there is less room for people to move around and make noise. The joke suggests that the townspeople decided to put the beach ball in the pool as a way to reduce the noise levels coming from the pool area.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is saying that the beach ball in the pool cuts down on the yelling and splashing, which are typical pool activities. However, because the beach ball is taking up the entire pool, there is no room for people to swim or splash around, making the beach ball an ineffective way to reduce pool noise.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person is saying that the ball in the pool cuts down on the yelling and splashing typically associated with children playing in a pool. The beach ball is so big that it doesn't allow for much movement, and thus the pool is much quieter than usual.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while a pool filled with a beach ball would minimize the amount of yelling and splashing (as people would be gently bouncing off of the ball instead of each other), it would also be very annoying and inconvenient. The joke highlights the trade-offs people have to make when using public pools.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while a pool filled with a giant beach ball would reduce the yelling and splashing that normally happens in a pool (because people would be enclosed in the ball), it would also be very difficult to swim in. The joke is clever because it points out the hidden downside of the seemingly innocuous beach ball.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while a pool filled with a beach ball would be quieter than a traditional pool because there would be no splashing, it would also be more difficult to swim in, and people would probably still be yelling because of the frustration of trying to swim.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually when there are people in a pool, there is a lot of yelling and splashing, but with the beach ball taking up the entire pool, there is no room for that.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a normal pool situation, people would be playing and making noise (yelling and splashing). However, the fact that the pool is completely filled with a beach ball makes it much more calm and quiet, since people can't really move around or make noise.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a clever way to keep people from being too loud in a pool. By having a giant beach ball in the pool, it would naturally reduce the amount of yelling and splashing because people would have to be careful not to hit the ball.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a big pool filled with a beach ball would be much quieter than a normal pool; there would be no splashing because people would be gently bouncing off the ball. This would be good for people who want to relax and don't want to deal with the noise of other swimmers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "pool" can mean two things: a swimming pool filled with water, or a group of people. In this situation, the pool is filled with a beach ball, so it's more like a group of people (i.e., a "human pool"). By having a beach ball in the pool, it cuts down on the yelling and splashing (i.e., the noise that would normally be associated with a group of people in a pool).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The pool being full of a beach ball cuts down on the yelling (of people playing in the pool) and thesplashing (of water).</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="118.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="120.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
