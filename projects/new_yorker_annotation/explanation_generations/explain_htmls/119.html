You have two more questions.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the old man has brought an exercise ball with him on his mountain climbing expedition. This is absurd because the exercise ball is not only unnecessary weight, but it's also not practical for climbing. It's likely that he brought the ball for a reason other than exercise, such as using it as a seat or something to lean on, but the joke is that he claims he brought it for his back.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's response to the backpacker's question is evasive and unhelpful. He doesn't explain why he has the ball, only that it's for his back, and then says that the backpacker has two more questions. This is frustrating for the backpacker, who probably just wanted to know why the man had brought the ball with him into the cave.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the aerobic ball is sitting in a cave, which is an unusual place to be doing exercises meant for a gym. Furthermore, he is a nomad, meaning he doesn't have a permanent home, which makes it even more unlikely that he would have an exercise ball. The man's response to the hiker's question implies that this is a common enough occurrence that the hiker should already know the answer.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="118.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="120.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
