However, in this case, the caveman couple is saying they are going to go with the other couple who is in the tall cave, implying that they will be saved from some sort of catastrophe.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two cave people are rejecting the offer to go on top of the tower with the other people. The other people are presumably going to safety, but the cave people don't want to go because they are going with Noah instead. Noah is presumably the Biblical figure who built an ark and saved two of every animal from a flood, which is an event that would kill cave people. The joke is a play on the fact that the two cave people are rejecting a chance of safety for something that is incredibly risky.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "going with Noah". In one sense, the couple is saying they're going to go with the other couple, i.e., leave with them. But in another sense, they could be saying they're going to go on the Ark with Noah --- which is a very old, large boat that was used to save animals from a flood. In this case, the joke is funny because the cavemen would be the animals being saved.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The caveman couple is saying that they are going to go with the other couple, who are going in the opposite direction. But, the word "Noah" is also a homophone for "know", as in, "we know where you are going". So, the joke is that the caveman couple knows that the other couple is going to get wet, because they are going towards the water.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the two couples. The caveman couple is living in relatively primitive conditions (although the man has built a tall cave), while the other couple is living in a tall cave that is much more advanced. The caveman couple is probably not as qualified to make a decision about who to go with, but they are making a decision anyway.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The couple in the cave is saying that they are going to go with Noah, as in the biblical Noah who built an ark and saved humanity from a great flood, but the other couple could be interpreted as saying they are going to go live in a Tall Tower, like the one in the story of the same name. The joke is clever because it's a play on words that not everyone will get, but those who do will find it very funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The couple in the cave is saying that they will go with Noah, as in the Biblical Noah who built an ark to save people from the flood, rather than go with the other couple who live in the very tall cave. The fact that they are saying this in a stone age context is also amusing because it is anachronistic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The couple in the cave is saying that they are going to go with the Biblical character Noah, who is famous for his ark, which saved two of every animal from a great flood. In this case, the couple is saying that they don't want to go with the other couple because they are presumably going to drown in the flood.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the story of Noah's Ark. In the Biblical story, Noah is instructed by God to build an ark and to bring two of every animal on board to be saved from the great flood. In this joke, the caveman couple is offered a spot on the tall cave, but they decline, saying they will go with Noah instead. This is funny because, of course, Noah's Ark is a mythical story, and there is no real Ark or Noah to save them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation depicted is similar to the biblical story of Noah's Ark. In the story, Noah was instructed by God to build an ark and bring two of every animal on it to safety before a great flood. In this situation, the caveman is being offered a ride on the ark, but he politely declines, saying that he and his wife have already made plans to go with Noah. The joke is clever because it plays on the fact that the characters are cavemen, who would not be familiar with the story of Noah's Ark.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is apparently being offered a place to stay in the high tower, but they are rejecting the offer because they have already made other arrangements. This is humorous because, in the Bible, Noah was the man who built an ark and saved two of every animal from a flood, so the couple is saying that they would rather go with him than stay in the tower.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is reject the offer to go with their friends, despite the fact that they are going to be on a very tall structure that is likely to be flooded. This is a play on the story of Noah's Ark, where Noah and his family were saved from the flood by being on the Ark. In this case, the couple is not going to be saved from the flood, because they are rejecting the offer to go with their friends.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The two cave people are walking to a tall building, which could be a tower, but they say they are going to go with Noah instead. This is a pun because Noah is known for the Biblical story in which he builds an ark and brings two of every animal on it to safety during a great flood. So, the joke is that the two cave people would rather go with Noah and be on the ark than go to the tall building.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The couple in the tall cave is waving to the other couple, who are looking for a place to stay, and telling them that they are going to go with Noah, as in, Noah's Ark. However, the other couple is probably looking for a place to stay in the cave because they don't want to get wet in the rain, and so they are rejecting the offer to go with Noah.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the juxtaposition of the primitive cave people with the modern day skyscraper. It's also a play on words; "Noah" is a common name, but it's also the name of the biblical character who built an ark and saved all of the animals from a flood. In this situation, the cave people are deciding whether or not to go with Noah, but they ultimately decide against it.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
