The aliens are discussing the cartoon in a serious manner, but the joke is that their standards for what is funny are different from what humans might find funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Sexy" can mean "provocative" or "alluring," but it can also mean "relating to or involving sex." In this context, the aliens are critiquing the cartoon and saying that it's not funny because the subject matter is related to sex. However, because they are aliens, the word "sex" takes on a whole new meaning --- instead of being a human sexual act, it's now a alien sexual act. This double-meaning makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the stereotype that men in positions of power often objectify women. The woman in the cartoon is shown in a sexily-posed position, and the editor is only concerned with whether or not the cartoon is actually funny. If the woman in the cartoon were not shown in a sexily-posed position, the editor would presumably not have the same objection.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the fact that many alien depictions in pop culture are of attractive women, which is often seen as a trope. In this case, the joke is that the alien editor is not finding the cartoon funny because it's not sexually appealing to him. This is a play on the fact that many people believe that sex sells, and that the aliens in this scene are no different.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the criterion for a successful cartoon in this instance is not whether or not it's funny, but whether or not it makes the woman in the cartoon look sexy. This is an unusual criterion, and it's made even funnier by the fact that the editor is an alien, which suggests that aliens may have different standards for what they find funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the editor is criticizing the cartoon for being unsexy, which is not a typical reason to reject a cartoon. The joke is clever because it playfully subverts the idea that all art, especially cartoons, should be analyzed for its artistic merits rather than its surface-level features.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the editor is saying that the cartoon is not good because it's not funny, but the real reason is that the female character in the cartoon is attractive. The editor is objectifying the woman in the cartoon, which is unexpected given that the woman is not a real person.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The cartoon editor is saying that the cartoon isn't funny, but the way he's saying it --- "it's not funny if she looks so sexy" --- makes it sound like he's saying that the cartoon is only funny because the woman in it is sexy. This is a clever way of pointing out that the cartoon is actually not funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that the editor is an alien; the audience is supposed to find it surprising that an alien would be editing a cartoon for the New Yorker. The joke is also clever because it's a reverse-caption: usually, the goal of the contest is to come up with a caption that would be appropriate for the cartoon, but in this case, the goal is to come up with a cartoon that would be appropriate for the given caption.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The editor is saying that the cartoon isn't funny because it's too sexy, but the author is probably thinking that the editor is saying that the cartoon isn't funny because the woman in it is too sexy. This misunderstanding is funny because it's a reversal of the typical power dynamic, with the author being the one who is trying to please the editor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's an ironic criticism of the cartoon. The editor is saying that the reason the cartoon isn't funny is because the woman in it is depicted as being too attractive. This is ironic because, usually, the reason a cartoon is funny is because it's exaggerated in some way --- and so, if the editor is correct, then it's the exaggeration of the woman's sexiness that makes the cartoon funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The alien editor is saying that the cartoon isn't funny, but the way he says it, "It's just not funny if she looks so sexy," makes it sound like he's saying the opposite, that the cartoon is funny because the woman in it looks sexy. This is a clever way to make a pun on the word "funny."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that the woman in the cartoon is attractive, but the editor is saying that the cartoon isn't funny because of it. The joke is clever because it's not only a play on the editor's opinion, but also a play on the fact that the woman in the cartoon is indeed sexy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it points out the sexism that can be inherent in cartoons: many female characters are drawn in an exaggeratedly sexualized manner, which can be gratuitous and undermine the humor of the cartoon. In this case, the editor is saying that the cartoon isn't funny because the female character is too sexy, implying that the cartoonist was more interested in titillating the viewer than making them laugh.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the often-discussed rule in the cartoon caption contest that the jokes should not be about sex. In this case, the aliens are discussing a cartoon, and the editor says that the joke wouldn't be funny if the woman in the cartoon was sexy. This is a play on the fact that many times, sex jokes are not allowed in the contest.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="80.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="82.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
