The joke is poking fun at the idea of a cat being a regal and stately monarch, when in reality they are just small and insignificant animals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "truth" can mean either the accurate, factual information, or it can be referring to the idea of a "truth" as in "the whole truth and nothing but the truth." In this case, the speaker is saying that the "truth" is that the other person (presumably the cat) came from a box of free kittens, i.e., they are not really royalty as their current outfit might suggest. This is a humorous way of saying that the cat is not really a king, and is just a regular cat in a costume.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "the truth will set you free." In this case, the man is telling his wife that the truth (that their cat is actually a free kitten) will cause them to get rid of him. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the phrase "your majesty," as in, the cat is not actually a king, despite his regal clothing and manner.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is saying that the cat came from a box of free kittens, meaning he was given to them for free, but the man is saying that the truth is the cat came from a box of free kittens, meaning he was born into a litter of free kittens. The play on words is humorous because it is unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is lounging like a king, and therefore must have been born into royalty, i.e., he must have come from a "fancy" lineage. However, the truth is that he was actually a free kitten from a box at a pet store, which means he has humble beginnings. The contrast between the cat's regal bearing and his actual origins is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is acting like a snooty king, lording over the two humans. However, the man is reminding the cat that he originally came from a box of free kittens, meaning he's not really anything special. The joke is clever because it's a play on words --- the cat is a "free cat" (i.e., not a slave), but he's also from a box of free kittens.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "you're not fit to wear the crown." In this case, the person telling the joke is suggesting that the cat wasn't born to royalty, but rather is just a regular cat that came from a box of free kittens. The joke is also funny because it's unexpected; usually when a cat is crowned king, it's because it's a special or noble cat, but in this case, it's just a regular cat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it is true that most cats come from a litter of kittens, the cat in this scene is acting like it is of a much higher status than it actually is. The owner's joke brings it back down to reality by reminding the cat that it is not actually royalty, but a lowly free kitten.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "you're not fit to lick my boots." The woman is trying to act superior to the man by telling him that he is of lower lineage than her, but the joke flips that power dynamic by revealing that the woman herself came from a litter of free kittens. This revelation undercuts her attempt at snobbery.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the image of a king and a free kitten. A king is usually associated with power, wealth, and prestige, whereas a free kitten is often seen as small, powerless, and worthless. In this joke, the man is telling the woman that she is like a free kitten, implying that she is not as special or important as she might think.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at the cat's regal pretensions. The cat is acting like it's a king, but the speaker points out that it's just a common housecat. This is unexpected because usually when a pet is treated like royalty, it's because it actually is royalty, like a lion or tiger. In this case, the cat is just a regular housecat, which makes the situation funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "you're not royalty, you're from a box of free kittens." The man in the suit is acting like he is superior to the woman, but the truth is that he is of lowly origin. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the fact that actual royalty often come from very humble beginnings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is acting like it is royalty, when in reality, it's just a regular cat that came from a litter of free kittens. The contrast between the cat's lofty attitude and its humble beginnings is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is true: the cat came from a litter of kittens that were given away for free, so it's not actually a noble king. The joke is also funny because it playfully pokes at the idea of a cat being crowned king, since they are not traditionally considered royalty.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is dressed up like a king, which implies that he is of high status. However, the truth is that he came from a box of free kittens, which means he is of low status. The contrast between the two is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="80.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="82.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
