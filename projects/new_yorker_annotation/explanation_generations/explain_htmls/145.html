She implies that the dolphin is intelligent and should be able to get a job instead of begging. The irony is that, even if the dolphin is intelligent, he still wouldn't be able to get a job because he's a dolphin. The woman's logic is faulty, which is why the joke is funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while dolphins are often considered to be intelligent animals, the fact that this particular dolphin is begging for money implies that it is not very intelligent. The woman's comment about the man giving money to the dolphin is sarcastic, since she is implying that the man is not very intelligent either for giving money to a beggar that cannot even talk.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Dolphin" can mean both the sea mammal, and a smart person (e.g., someone who is "a few sandwiches short of a picnic"). The woman is mad because she thinks the man is giving money to an intelligent person who could get a job, rather than a helpless animal. However, the man is actually giving money to a dolphin, which explains why he would need to beg for money in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is mad at the man for giving money to a beggar, who happens to be a dolphin. The dolphin is intelligent enough to be begging for money, but the woman believes that he should be intelligent enough to get a job instead. The joke is clever because, while the woman's logic is sound, the fact that the beggar is a dolphin makes it impossible for him to get a job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that dolphins are intelligent animals. The woman is mad at the man for giving money to a beggar, and her reasoning is that if the beggar is so intelligent, he should be able to get a job. But, of course, the beggar is a dolphin, so he can't get a job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common argument against giving money to beggars: that they should just get a job. But, in this case, the beggar is a dolphin, which can't get a job because it's not intelligent enough to do human work. Furthermore, the dolphin is begging precisely because it can't get a job to support itself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that dolphins are one of the smartest animals. The woman is saying that, because dolphins are supposedly so smart, the beggar dolphin should be able to get a job and support itself, rather than relying on charity. However, the fact that the beggar is a dolphin makes this a bit of a non-sequitur, since dolphins don't usually have jobs (at least, not jobs that would be accessible to them on a street corner).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is mad at the man for giving money to a dolphin that is begging, on the grounds that dolphins are intelligent animals and should be able to get a job instead of begging. The irony is that, in the real world, it is often difficult for intelligent animals like dolphins to get jobs, because they can't communicate with humans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is mad at the man for giving money to a beggar, but the beggar is a dolphin, which is an animal that is usually considered to be very intelligent. In other words, the woman is saying that if the dolphin is so smart, he should be able to get a job instead of begging for money. The irony is that, of course, dolphins can't get jobs because they're not human.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is mad at the man for giving money to the dolphin, who is begging. The woman is saying that if the dolphin is so smart, he should be able to get a job instead of begging. This is funny because it's impossible for a dolphin to get a job, since they are not human. Also, the woman's logic is circular, since the reason the dolphin is begging is likely because he can't get a job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is mad at the man for giving money to a dolphin who is begging, and she says that if he's so smart, he should get a job. The joke is clever because, of course, dolphins can't get jobs because they are not humans. The woman's comment is therefore naive and amusing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because dolphins are often considered to be one of the smarter animals, and yet they are still begging for money. The woman is saying that if the dolphin is so smart, he should be able to get a job and support himself, rather than begging.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's anger is misplaced: the man is helping the dolphin, who is begging, by giving him money. The woman is mad because she thinks the dolphin is lazy and should get a job instead of begging. However, the irony is that dolphins are very intelligent animals, and could probably get a job if they wanted to, but they choose to beg instead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is mad at the man for giving money to a dolphin, who is begging. The irony is that dolphins are often considered to be very intelligent animals, and so the woman is saying that if the dolphin is so smart, it should be able to get a job. Of course, the reality is that dolphins cannot get jobs, because they are not human.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while dolphins are considered to be very intelligent animals, the woman is right that if he's so smart, he should get a job instead of begging. The man is probably just trying to be nice by giving the dolphin some money, but the woman is unimpressed.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="144.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="146.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
