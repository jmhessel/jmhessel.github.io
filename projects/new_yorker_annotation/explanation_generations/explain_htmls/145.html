In this case, the man is suggesting that the person on the right may have a similar urge to pull out the feathers of the pigeons, given that they are so covered in them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person on the right has been completely taken over by the pigeons, to the point where they are barely recognizable as a human. The man on the left is still trying to have a conversation with them, but is struggling because of the pigeons. He suggests that they might want to rethink their ringtone, as it is likely attracting even more pigeons.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's ringtone is attracting the birds, and so the other man is suggesting that he change it to something that won't attract so much attention. In other words, he should choose a less conspicuous ringtone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the ringtone that the victim has on his phone is attracting the birds; the contrast between the innocent ringtone and the sinister outcome is what makes it funny. The fact that the other man is just reading and not helping the victim is also part of the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man covered in birds probably has a phone ringtone that attracts birds, which is why they are all over him. The fact that he isn't using a more traditional ringtone like "Birdy Num Num" or "I Believe I Can Fly" is unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man being attacked by birds is likely being attacked because his ringtone (or some other noise he's making) is reminiscent of the birds' mating call. The other man's suggestion to change his ringtone is a way to stop the birds from attacking, but it also implies that the man's current ringtone is obnoxious.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the book has a ringtone that attracts birds, and he is now covered in them. The joke suggests that he should change his ringtone to something that doesn't attract so many birds if he wants to avoid this situation in the future.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man covered in birds has attracted so many of them that they are now effectively perched on him like he is a piece of furniture or a telephone pole. The man's phone ringing would startle the birds and cause them to fly away, so the joke is suggesting that he change his ringtone to something that won't bother the birds.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's ringtone is attracting the birds, and so the other man is suggesting that he change it to something that won't attract so much attention. The fact that the man is being covered in birds is also funny in itself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man covered in birds is being given the same treatment that someone might give to a bird feeder: the birds are flocking to him because he has food (in the form of bird seed) that they want. However, the bird seed in this case is the man's phone, which is playing a bird-themed ringtone. The joke is that the man's phone ringtone is attracting birds, which is probably not what he intended.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the left is reacting to the situation as if it's normal, despite the fact that there's a person covered in pigeons on the right. The man on the left probably assumes that the person on the right is either reclining or has a condition where birds flock to them, when in reality, the person on the right's phone is probably playing a bird-related sound or song, which is attracting the pigeons.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's ringtone is apparently attracting the birds, who are attacking him as a result. This is a play on the common advice to not play music loudly in public places because it can attract unwanted attention. In this case, the attention is from birds, which makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man covered in birds has likely been imprinted on by the birds. This means that the birds see him as their mother, and are nesting on him as they would on a tree or a bush. This is strange and unexpected behavior from birds, who are typically afraid of humans. The fact that he has been imprinted on also suggests that he has been sitting in the same spot for a long time, which is why his friend suggests changing his ringtone (to attract attention/signal for help).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man covered in birds has a phone ringtone that attracts birds, instead of scares them away. This is the opposite of the expected reaction, making it humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's ringtone attracts the birds, who then attack him. The man's ringtone is probably quite loud, and is disrupting the peace of the park. The other man's comment about wanting to rethink the ringtone is a veiled suggestion that the man should change his ringtone to something less annoying.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="144.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="146.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
