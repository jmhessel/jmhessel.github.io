The man who cannonballed into the meeting is now in a position to be a fly on the wall, since he's hidden behind the wall of the meeting room. The fact that he's a fly on the wall is also ironic, because he's not actually observing anything, since he's hidden.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who cannonballed into the meeting interrupts the proceedings, but instead of being embarrassed or chided, he acts like he planned to do that all along and tries to blend in with the wall. The other businesspeople in the room are bemused and carry on with their meeting.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="31.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="33.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
