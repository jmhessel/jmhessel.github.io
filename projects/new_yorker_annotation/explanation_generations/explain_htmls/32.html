Wait 'til we get to the lake.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of the scene, the lake is not more impressive than the cliff. The lake is a natural body of water, while the cliff is a man-made structure. Furthermore, the lake is at the bottom of the cliff, so it's not even in the same league as the cliff in terms of feats of engineering.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is exaggerating the effects of gravity. In reality, the hikers would have to be on a very steep incline for the man to be able to walk "down" the cliff face. The joke is also funny because the speaker implies that there is an even more impressive feat to come, which is even less likely.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is walking down the cliff, which is defy gravity, and yet the speaker is nonchalantly waiting for them to reach the lake. This implies that there are even more impressive feats to come, despite the fact that the man is currently performing an impressive feat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it sets up the expectation that the vertical hiker will walk across the lake -- which would be even more impressive, given that lakes are usually horizontal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The lake the speaker is referring to is the lake at the bottom of the cliff, which the hikers will presumably reach by going down the cliff (rather than, say, driving there). The joke is that the speaker is saying that the vertical cliff-walking feat is only impressive in comparison to walking on level ground, which is what they will do once they reach the lake.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it suggests that there is a place where the hikers will go that is even more impressive than the cliff they are currently on. The cliff was already impressive because it is unnatural for a human to be able to walk down it, but if there is a place that is even more impressive, it suggests that there are things in the world that are beyond human understanding or ability.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The hiker who is talking is not impressed by the other hiker's gravity-defying feat; instead, he says that he will be more impressed when they get to the lake. The word "lake" is a homonym for the word "leaky," meaning that the hiker will be more impressed when they get to a body of water where he can see water leaking out (and presumably, into the lake).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it downplays the impressive feat of the hiker who is walking down the cliff face. The speaker suggests that there is something even more impressive that they will see later, trivializing the earlier feat. This makes the joke funny because it is unexpected and because it reversal the common expectations about what is impressive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is implying that there is a place where hikers can walk on the water, which is even more impressive than walking down a cliff face. This is impossible, of course, but the idea of one impossible thing being more impressive than another impossible thing is amusing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "wait 'til" can mean either "wait until" or " wait 'til you see". In this case, the hiker is saying that the other hiker's feat is impressive, but wait until they see the lake. The joke is that the hiker is actually saying that the other hiker's feat is not impressive, and that they will be even more unimpressed when they see the lake.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in comparison to the hiker walking down the cliff, the other obstacles on the hike are not nearly as impressive. The joke suggests that there are even more amazing feats to come on the hike, making the hiker walking down the cliff seem less special in comparison.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the hiker who is walking down the cliff is doing something that is very impressive and seemingly impossible. The other hiker says that it isn't impressive and that he will be even more impressed when they get to the lake. The implication is that the second hiker will see the first hiker do an even more impossible feat, such as swimming in the air.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is "defying gravity" by walking down the cliff, but the other man says that he will be even more impressed when they get to the "lake" because that will be a much more significant feat. "Lake" is a homophone for "lucky," which means that the man is saying that it's lucky that they man isn't walking on air.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the assumption that the person who is walking down the cliff is doing something amazing/unusual. However, the person who is talking downplays what the walker is doing by saying that there is an even more impressive feat yet to come. This creates a sense of anticipation in the listener, which is funny because the speaker is just messing with them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The first meaning is literal: the person who is talking is impressed by the feats of the other hiker, and is looking forward to seeing more impressive feats. The second meaning is that the lake at the bottom of the cliff is actually a lake of lava, and the person who is talking is actually looking forward to seeing the other hiker die.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
