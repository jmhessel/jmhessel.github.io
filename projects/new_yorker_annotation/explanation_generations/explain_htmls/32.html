The joke is clever because, in a way, the lawyer is actually telling the truth: if the Grim Reaper is found guilty, he will be "given life" in the sense that he will be forced to keep living and can't reap any more souls.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lawyer is telling his client, who is Death, that he's afraid the jury will give him life. The situation is absurd because, of course, Death cannot be put on trial, and even if he could, the jury would not be able to give him life.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The lawyer is telling his client, who is personified Death, that he's afraid the court will give him life, meaning a prison sentence, instead of death. However, because his client is actually Death, the lawyer's comment takes on a second meaning: he's afraid the court will give Death life, meaning an immortal life, instead of Death being able to do his job and kill the person.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The lawyer is telling his client, who is Death, that he is afraid the jury will find him guilty and give him a life sentence. This is funny because, of course, death is the opposite of life, so a life sentence would be the worst possible sentence for Death.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Grim Reaper is, of course, immune to death, yet here he is concerned about being given life in prison, which is the opposite of death. The joke cleverly uses the concept of death to make a point about life.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lawyer's client is Death, who is of course immortal. The lawyer is telling Death that he's afraid the jury will give him life in prison, which would be the opposite of what Death wants. The joke is clever because it plays with the fact that "life" can mean both "life imprisonment" and "the state of being alive".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Grim Reaper, who personifies death, is on trial and the lawyer is telling him that he's afraid the jury will give him life. The idea of death being given life is absurd, which is why the joke is funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The lawyer is telling his client, who is personification of death, that he's afraid the jury will giving him life, meaning a prison sentence, instead of acquitting him. The lawyer is afraid of this because it would be ironic if death was given life in prison.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The lawyer is afraid that, given the evidence, the jury will rule that his client, Death, will have to "serve life" in jail. Serving life in jail is a sentence given to criminals who are deemed to dangerous to release back into society. The lawyer's client is actually Death, who is often seen as a personification of the end of life. The joke is clever because it takes a common phrase and gives it a new, unintended meaning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The lawyer is telling his client, who is death, that he's afraid the jury will give him life, meaning a prison sentence. But of course,Death is immune to prison sentences. The irony is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lawyer is trying to comfort his client, who is facing a possible sentence of life in prison, by telling him that he might only get life instead of death. However, his client is literally Death, so the lawyer's words have the opposite effect.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The Grim Reaper is, of course, the personification of death, and so is not subject to the usual laws of life, such as being tried in a court of law. However, the lawyer is still trying to defend the Grim Reaper as if he were a normal person, and so the lawyer says that he is worried the jury will give the Grim Reaper "life," i.e., a sentence of imprisonment. The joke is clever because it is both a play on words and a play on the idea of the justice system.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The Grim Reaper has come to the lawyer for help because he is facing "life" in court --- the lawyer thinks he means a life sentence, but the Grim Reaper literally means he is facing the end of his life. The irony is that the lawyer is trying to help the Grim Reaper, who is responsible for ending lives, avoid death.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The Grim Reaper is usually associated with death, so the lawyer's joke that the court might give the Grim Reaper life is humorous because it is an impossibility.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because life is the opposite of death, so the lawyer is saying that he's afraid the court will give his client a sentence of death, which is ironic because that is his client's natural state.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="31.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="33.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
