The chef is in prison, and he's speaking to his wife on the phone. He tells her that he misses her, and he then says that he made a cake for her, but he guesses she won't be getting it because he's in prison. She tells him that she got the cake, and he's surprised. He then asks her how it is, and she responds by saying "it's a bit dry." The joke is that the chef misunderstood his wife, and he thinks she's talking about the cake when she's actually talking about their sex life.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play-on-words. "Beat until stiff" is a common instruction when making meringue, but in this context, it takes on a whole new meaning as a way of torturing someone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the prisoner is talking to a man who is dressed as a chef, and she says "beat until stiff" in reference to making eggs. However, in the context of prison, "beat until stiff" could also mean beating someone up until they are unconscious --- which is a more likely meaning given the setting. The contrast between the two meanings is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The chef is in prison, and she's speaking to the woman on the phone about a recipe for meringue. The woman tells the chef to "beat until stiff," but the chef takes this literally and starts beating the eggs. The woman, realizing the misunderstanding, clarifies that she meant for the chef to beat the egg whites until they are stiff.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of the word "stiff." In cooking, the term "beat until stiff" usually refers to beating eggs until they form stiff peaks. However, in this prison context, the term could also refer to beating a person until they are unconscious or dead. The chef, who is talking to his boss (the woman), is surprised that she wants him to beat the eggs more, given the context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is asking the chef how to make a cake, and the chef is telling her to beat the eggs until they are stiff. However, in prison, the word "stiff" can also refer to a corpse, so the joke is that the woman is actually asking the chef how to make a cake using a dead body.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman on the phone is talking to a chef, and she misheard him say "beat until stiff" as a instruction for how to prepare eggs. In reality, the chef was telling her how to make a meringue, but she misunderstood because she was in prison and familiarity with cooking terms would be low. The joke is a play on words between the literal meaning of "beat until stiff" (for eggs) and the more figurative meaning (for meringue).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is talking to a chef, and she misunderstood his instructions for making a dish. She thought he said to "beat" the eggs until they were "stiff," when in fact he said to "beat" the eggs until they were "stiff."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "beat until stiff" usually refers to beating eggs until they form stiff peaks. In this case, the woman is asking the chef to beat her husband because he is not listening to her, which is a form of domestic violence. The chef, instead, thinks she is asking him to make a cake, so he says that the eggs need to be beaten until stiff.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "beating until stiff" is a metaphor for how to make meringue, but in the context of prison, it takes on a whole new meaning of criminal activity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a double meaning. The woman on the phone is talking to a chef, and they are discussing a recipe. The woman says that she was confused about a instruction in the recipe, and the chef clarifies that "beat until stiff" refers to eggs. However, the phrase "beat until stiff" can also mean to hit someone until they are unconscious, which is a more violent meaning. In the context of the prison, the joke is funnier because it is more likely that the woman on the phone is talking to a criminal who was beaten unconscious rather than a chef.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the double meaning of "stiff." In cooking, "stiff" often means "firm," as in, "beat the eggs until they are stiff." However, in this case, the woman is sad because she misunderstood the chef's instructions --- she thought he meant to beat the prisoners until they were unconscious, rather than the eggs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman on the phone is talking to a man who is dressed as a chef, and she is asking him about a recipe. The man beat the eggs until they were stiff, but the woman interprets this to mean that he beat a person until they were stiff.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is talking to a man who is dressed as a chef, and she is telling him that she beating the eggs until they are stiff. The man is probably not used to being in a prison, and so he is thinking that the woman is literally telling him to beat someone up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Beat until stiff" is a common instruction when making meringue, but in this case, the woman is in jail and the chef is telling her that he misunderstood her request to be beaten. The joke is clever because it's both a play on words and a commentary on the harsh conditions in prison.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="28.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="30.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
