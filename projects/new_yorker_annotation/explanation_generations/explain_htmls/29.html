This is a play on the fact that dummies are often used by lawyers to represent their clients in court.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man holding the dummy is a lawyer, and the dummy is his client. The lawyer is telling the man at the desk, who is presumably the opposing lawyer, that his client won't be talking. This is a play on the phrase "dumb as a dummy", meaning that the client is so dumb that he can't even speak.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is holding a "dummy," which is another word for a puppet. This man is acting as the dummy's lawyer, and is telling the employee not to talk to the dummy, because it could incriminate itself. This is a play on the phrase "to not talk to the police," which is often good advice given by lawyers to their clients.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the dummy is acting as if the dummy is his client, and he is telling the other man that he has advised his client not to talk. This is a play on words because usually, when a lawyer tells their client not to talk, it's because they don't want them to incriminate themselves. However, in this case, the client is a dummy, and so there is no risk of them incriminating themselves, because they aren't real.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is holding a puppet, which is a common prop for ventriloquists. The ventriloquist is pretending that the puppet is his "client," and is telling the employee that the puppet shouldn't talk, which of course the puppet will ignore. This is a play on the fact that often, in a real lawyer-client relationship, the lawyer will tell the client not to talk to avoid self-incrimination.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "to take something on puppet." The man is holding a puppet, but he's also "taking on" the employee, or representing him in a meeting. The phrase "to take something on puppet" usually means to take on a responsibility or task, but in this case, it's literal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because often times in a business setting, clients or customers are advised not to talk to avoid incriminating themselves. However, in this case, the client is a puppet, and the lawyer is telling the employee not to talk to the puppet in order to avoid incriminating themselves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the dummy is a lawyer, and the man at the desk is his client. The client is being advised not to talk, presumably because anything he says could be used against him in court. The joke is funny because it's unexpected to see a lawyer with a dummy in a business setting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is a lawyer, and he is using his puppet to represent his client in the office. He is telling the employee not to talk to his client, or the puppet, because it might incriminate his client in some way. The joke is also clever because it is a play on words; the phrase "to advise someone not to talk" can also mean to tell them to be quiet, which is what the lawyer is literally doing by using the puppet.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the dummy is a lawyer, and the "client" he's referring to is the dummy. In other words, the joke is poking fun at the stereotype of lawyers not giving direct answers to questions and instead deflecting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase, "to keep quiet," or "to not say anything." The lawyer representing the dummy is telling the man at the desk that his client, the dummy, will not be saying anything. This is amusing because it's ironic: the dummy literally cannot talk, so it's redundant for the lawyer to say that.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the dummy is a lawyer, and the man he's talking to is his client. The lawyer is telling his client not to say anything, which is ironic because the client is a dummy and can't talk. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the phrase "dumb as a dummy."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the dummy is pretending that the dummy is his client. In reality, of course, dummies cannot talk, so the lawyer is telling his client (the dummy) not to say anything, which is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is holding a dummy, which is a type of puppet, and saying that his "client" (the dummy) should not talk. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the man is both giving legal advice to the dummy and telling the dummy not to speak.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the dummy is clearly a lawyer, and the joke is a play on words. The dummy is not supposed to talk, which is what the lawyer is advising his client to do. However, the fact that the dummy is literally not able to talk because it's a dummy is also a play on words.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="28.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="30.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
