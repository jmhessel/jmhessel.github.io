This is unexpected because, in most cases, violence would be the more likely option when two groups are in conflict. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the phrase "shoot at dawn."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "shoot at dawn" is a military term meaning to execute someone at sunrise, while the phrase "sue at dawn" is a legal term meaning to file a lawsuit at the beginning of the day. In this joke, the soldiers are telling the businessmen that they will file a lawsuit against them at dawn, instead of shooting them. This is unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that, in many business deals, the lawyers representing the two parties will often have a "stand-off" where they both threaten to sue each other if the deal falls through. In this case, the soldiers on the horse represent one business, and the businessmen on foot represent another. The joke is that the soldiers are going to take the more literal approach of fighting at dawn instead of suing.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="28.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="30.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
