The fact that he is being attacked by the very thing that he opened the can for is ironic, and thus funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person on the right opened a can of food (presumably for the birds) and ended up getting covered with them. The man on the left is telling him that he shouldn't have opened the can, because it's led to an unexpected and undesirable outcome.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man covered in birds is experiencing a negative consequence as a result of the other man's actions. The man with the book opened a can of worms, which attracted the birds, and now the other man is dealing with the pests. The joke would be even funnier if the man with the book was reading a can of worms, but it's still funny without that context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man who is covered in birds is saying that the man who opened the can of worms (likely metaphorically) should not have done so. However, the fact that the man is covered in birds suggests that he literally opened a can of worms, which has caused the birds to flock to him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the phrase "that can of worms" is often used to refer to a situation that is complicated and has many consequences, none of which are good. In this case, the person on the right opened a can of worms by feeding the pigeons, and now they are covered in the birds.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is covered in birds is being literalized: he opened a can of worms and the worms (represented by the birds in the joke) have come out and are now all over him. The other man is sitting there reading his book, nonchalantly telling him that he shouldn't have opened the can in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is being attacked by the birds is being punished for something he did ("opening a can of worms"), and the other man is simply enjoying the show without helping. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the man is being attacked by birds, but the phrase "a can of worms" is often used to describe a situation that is getting out of control.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is being attacked by birds is being attacked because he opened a can of worms. This is a metaphor for starting a problem or conflict that was previously dormant. The man who is reading is not helped by the can of worms comment, because he is not the one who opened the can in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man covered in birds is experiencing a negative consequence (being covered in birds) as a result of something he did (opening a can of worms). The phrase "you shouldn't have opened that can of worms" is often used to warn someone that they are about to experience a negative consequence as a result of their actions. In this case, the warning was accurate, but not heeded, with humorous results.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is covered in birds is being punished for trying to feed them. The joke is a play on the phrase "you shouldn't have opened that can of worms," which is often used to describe someone who has gotten themselves into a situation that they cannot get out of. In this case, the man literally opened a can of worms and the birds ate them, which is why they are now attacking him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with birds on him is covered in them, and it seems like they are there because he opened a can of worms. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the phrase "you shouldn't have opened that can of worms", which is used to describe a situation where someone has accidentally created a problem by doing something. In this case, the man opened a can of worms and the worms turned into birds.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man being attacked by birds is being punished for feeding them. The idiom "to open a can of worms" means to do something that causes a lot of problems, and in this case, the man's action of feeding the birds has turned around to bite him literally.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the phrase "You shouldn't have opened that can of worms." The phrase is often used to describe a situation where someone has done something that has caused a lot of trouble, or unleashed a can of worms. In this case, the person on the right has unleashed a can of worms, in the form of a can of food that has attracted a lot of pigeons.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the man being attacked by birds may have opened a can of worms, the man did not do anything to deserve being covered in birds. The can of worms was likely a metaphor for starting something that couldn't be easily stopped, and the man getting attacked by birds is an extreme example of this.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man being attacked by birds is being punished for something he did (opened a can of worms) and the penalty doesn't fit the crime. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the man didn't actually open a can of worms, but he did open a can (of food) which attracted the birds.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="143.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="145.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
