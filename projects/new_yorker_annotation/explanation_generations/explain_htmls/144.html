The head is also watching TV, which is a couch potato activity, further emphasizing the unusualness of the situation. The wife's reaction is also funny because she is staring at the sofa angrily, as if it is a person who is not paying attention to her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is unexpected that the head would be coming out of the couch. It is also unexpected that the head would be watching TV. The joke is clever because it uses the familiar trope of a wife being angry with her husband for not helping around the house and instead watching TV, but in this case, the husband is literally a part of the couch.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the husband has taken on the form of the couch, which is something that is commonly associated with being lazy and not moving.
