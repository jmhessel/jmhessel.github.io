The reception is where I fall to pieces.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "fall to pieces": in a normal scenario, "falling to pieces" would mean that the man is emotional and crying at the wedding reception. However, in this context, with the man looking at the anthropomorphic wedding cake, "falling to pieces" takes on a whole new meaning: the man is going to eat the cake, which means that the cake will literally fall to pieces.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is saying that he can remain calm during the wedding ceremony, but during the reception (where people are celebrating and there is often more chaos), he will "fall to pieces". However, the fact that the cake is alive and smiling makes it unclear if the man is still talking about the cake, or if he is now talking about himself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is looking at a wedding cake which is "topped" with a figurine of a bride and groom; in other words, the cake is "topped off" with the symbol of marriage. However, the man says that he falls to "pieces" during the reception, which is another way of saying that he falls apart. In this context, the man is saying that he falls apart during weddings, which is ironic because the cake is a symbol of marriage.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is looking at a cake with a figurine of a couple getting married, which is a reminder of his own pending nuptials. The joke is that he's saying that he'll be fine during the ceremony, but he'll "fall to pieces" during the reception --- meaning that he'll be so overwhelmed with emotion that he'll start crying.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is about to get married, and the cake is his bride. The fact that the cake is a sentient being that can talk is humorous, as is the man's reaction to it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "To fall to pieces" can mean to become very emotional, as one might at a wedding reception, or it can mean to literally break into pieces, as the cake is doing. In this case, it is both: the man is emotional because he is seeing his cake literally fall to pieces.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Falling to pieces" can mean to decomposed, but in this context, it means to become very emotional. The cake is "falling to pieces" because it is a wedding cake and it is being eaten. The man is "falling to pieces" because he is emotional about the cake, which is a metaphor for how he will feel at the wedding reception when he sees the wedding cake being eaten.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the normal expectations of a wedding cake (that it would be in the shape of a bride and groom, or at least be aesthetically pleasing) and the fact that this cake is anthropomorphized and thus, ugly. The man's reaction of fear is also expected given the cake's appearance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is saying that he can hold it together during the wedding ceremony, despite the fact that the wedding cake is alive and smiling at him. He's saying that he'll only fall to pieces during the reception, which is usually when people let loose and have more fun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is looking at a wedding cake that has been anthropomorphized, meaning that it has been given human features (eyes and a mouth). The man is scared because, traditionally, the bride and groom cut the cake together at the wedding reception. So, the man is scared because he will have to cut into the cake, which now has human features, and thus, cutting into the cake will be like cutting into a person.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "fall to pieces": in a normal context, it means to become very emotional, e.g., crying at a wedding reception. However, in this context, "falling to pieces" refers to the fact that the wedding cake is literally a anthropomorphized cake with eyes and a mouth, and it is looking at the man as if it is going to eat him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is saying that he can "keep it together" during the ceremony, meaning he can hold himself together and not cry or show any emotion. The reception is where he "falls to pieces," meaning he'll be more emotional and crying because it will be after the ceremony when he's celebrating with friends and family. The cake is anthropomorphized in that it's showing an emotional reaction to the man's joke, and the bottom tier of the cake is crying.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of the word "fall": in a normal scenario, "to fall to pieces" would mean to be so overwhelmed with emotion that one cannot hold oneself together. However, in this context, with a cake that is literally falling to pieces, it takes on a new meaning: the man is afraid that he will not be able to keep the cake together during the reception.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because weddings are often a stressful time for people, and the reception is often when they let loose and relax. In this case, the joke is literal, as the man sees the cake with a smiley face and a couple on it, and imagines that it is literally falling to pieces.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is looking at a cake that has been anthropomorphized, meaning it has been given human characteristics (eyes, a mouth). The joke is clever because "to fall to pieces" is both a idiom meaning to lose one's composure, and also what would happen if the man tried to eat the cake.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="143.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="145.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
