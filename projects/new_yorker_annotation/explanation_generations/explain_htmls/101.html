The first meaning is that Tarzan and Jane are raising their child in a tree, which is a far cry from the city. The second meaning is that Tarzan assumed they would raise their child, which is a play on the name "Dylan," as in the musician Bob Dylan. So, Tarzan assumed they would raise their child to be like Bob Dylan, a musician from the city.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "dylan" can refer to a type of tree, or it can be a man's name. In this situation, Jane is pregnant and they are in a tree, so the man's name is likely to be Dylan. However, the fact that they are in a tree suggests that they might be trying to raise their child in a more natural environment, which would be the opposite of the city.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The couple is in a tree, and the husband says that he assumed they would "raise" their child in the city. The word "raise" can mean both to bring up a child, and to lift something up. So the joke is that, even though they are currently in a tree, the husband assumed they would raise their child in a city environment where there are no trees.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="100.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="102.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
