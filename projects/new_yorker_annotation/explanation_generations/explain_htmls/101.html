The phrase "second opinion" usually refers to a doctor's opinion on a medical diagnosis, but in this context, the "second opinion" the lion is referring to is whether or not to eat the bear. This is also a play on the common predator/prey relationship, in which the lion is the predator and the bear is the prey.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "second opinion" is often used to mean getting a different medical opinion to make sure the first one is correct. In this case, the "second opinion" is literal: the lion is saying that he still has room for another person (the doctor's second opinion) in his stomach. The joke is dark because it implies that the lion ate the doctor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The bear and the lion are looking at each other after they've both eaten the doctor, and the lion says that he still has room for a "second opinion." This could mean that he's still hungry and wants to eat more, or it could mean that he wants the bear's opinion on what to do next. Both interpretations are funny, but the second one is funnier because it's unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lion and the bear are both considering eating the other one, and the bear makes a pun about how there's still room for a "second opinion." This is clever because, in addition to being a play on words, it's also a clever way of saying that the bear is considering making the lion his meal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "I need a second opinion." A second opinion is usually sought when someone is unsure about a diagnosis or a course of treatment. In this case, the lion and the bear have eaten a doctor and are discussing whether or not to eat a second one. The fact that they are considering eating a second doctor for a second opinion is both dark and absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "I need a second opinion." In this case, the lion or the bear that ate the doctor is saying that it still has room for another person (doctor) to be eaten, and is thus asking the other lion or bear for its opinion on the matter. This is absurd, of course, because lions and bears don't eat people for opinions, they eat them for food.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lion and the bear are looking at each other after finishing their meal of the doctor, and one of them jokes that he's still hungry and would like a second opinion. This is a play on words because "second opinion" can mean either getting a different opinion from another expert, or in this case, it means eating another doctor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lion and bear are making a joke about how they both ate the doctor. The lion is saying that he still has room for a second opinion, meaning that he could eat another doctor, implying that the first doctor's opinion wasn't very filling. This is a dark joke because it's playing on the fact that the two animals killed and ate a human being.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "second opinion." A second opinion is usually sought when someone is unsure about a diagnosis or a course of treatment. In this case, the lion and the bear have eaten a doctor, and are thus looking for a second opinion on whether or not they should eat another one. The joke is made more humorous by the fact that the bear and the lion are the ones seeking the opinions, rather than the humans who would be more typically be in this position.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "I need a second opinion." opining. The lion and the bear have just eaten a doctor, but the joke is that they are still looking for more opinions, i.e., more food. This is a dark joke, but it's also clever.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lion and bear are discussing the fact that they just ate a doctor. The lion is asking the bear if he's sure that the doctor was dead, to which the bear replies that he's sure because he (the bear) is a doctor. This is a play on the phrase "second opinion," which is often sought from another doctor when an initial diagnosis is uncertain. Here, the lion is asking for a "second opinion" on whether or not the doctor was dead, and the bear, as a doctor, is providing that opinion.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lion and the bear have just eaten a doctor, and yet, the lion is still asking for a second opinion, implying that he wants to eat another doctor.
