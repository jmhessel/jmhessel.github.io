The word "pulse" can refer to both the physical examination a doctor does to check a patient's heartbeat, as well as the metaphor of "the pulse of life" or "the heartbeat of the world." In this joke, God is worried about his own pulse, or heartbeat, and the doctor is telling him that he shouldn't worry because he (God) is the one who gives life, and thus has a strong pulse.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The doctor is telling God that He worries too much, but what he means is that the pulse is too weak. In other words, he's saying that God's pulse is weak, which is a humorous way of saying that God is worrying too much.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "worry" can mean either "to feel anxious or concerned about something" or "to damage or wear down by rubbing or friction." In this case, the doctor is telling God that he is rubbing his hand too much (i.e. causing wear and tear), and that he doesn't need to worry (i.e. feel anxious) about it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The hand is not really God, but is instead a physical representation of God. The joke is also a pun on the phrase "you worry too much," which is often said to people who are anxious or stressed. In this case, the person who is worrying too much is God, and the doctor is telling God to relax.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the giant arm and the doctor's casual attitude. It is as if the giant arm is a common occurrence and the doctor is telling God that he/she is worrying too much.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is telling God that He shouldn't worry so much. This is funny because it is a reversal of the expected roles: usually, it is the person who is sick or injured who is told by the doctor not to worry, not the other way around. In addition, the idea of God worrying is funny because He is all-powerful and thus shouldn't have anything to worry about.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is scolding God for worrying too much. It's an unusual reversal of roles, where the doctor is telling God that he is overreacting about something. It's also funny because it's a play on words --- "worry" can mean both to feel anxious about something and to damage something by rubbing it too much. So the doctor is telling God that he is causing damage by worrying too much.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The doctor is telling the hand, which belongs to God, that He shouldn't worry too much. This is funny because it is a reversal of the typical relationship between a doctor and patient: usually, it is the doctor telling the patient not to worry, not the other way around.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor's reaction to the giant arm is so casual. He goes about his business checking the pulse, as if this happens all the time. This is absurd because, of course, a giant arm reaching into a doctor's office is not a normal occurrence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is trying to take the pulse of a hand that is much larger than him. The joke could also be interpreted as God being worried about his own health, and the doctor telling him that he is worrying too much.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The doctor is worried about the large hand, which could be indicative of a health problem, but it turns out that the hand belongs to God. This play on words is humorous because it is unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is telling God that He shouldn't worry so much. It's amusing because it's a role reversal: usually, it's humans who tell God not to worry, and not the other way around.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common trope of a person's "worrywart" friend or family member telling them to stop worrying so much. In this case, the person who is worrywart is God, and the doctor is telling him that he shouldn't worry so much. This is funny because it is a complete reversal of the common trope.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In this case, the doctor is worried about his patient's pulse, but the giant arm belongs to God, who is also worried, but for a different reason. The joke is clever because it takes a common phrase ("you worry too much") and applies it to a very unusual situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it suggests that the doctor is diagnosing the hand, which is attached to God, and telling God that He shouldn't worry so much. This is humorous because it is a play on the common trope of patients being told by their doctor to not worry, even though worrying is often the natural reaction to receiving a diagnosis.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="8.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="10.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
