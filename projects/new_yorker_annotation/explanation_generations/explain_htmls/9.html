A hive is a place where bees live, but it can also be used to refer to a group of people who are all living together. In this case, the joke is implying that the beehive has a sense of community because there is a human face peeking out from it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. A "sense of community" is usually a good thing, something that makes a small town or group appealing. However, in this case, the small community is the beehive inside of the man's head, which is not a desirable thing. Therefore, the joke is that the small community is actually a negative thing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A beehive is a structure made by bees to live in, and it can also be a metaphor for a close-knit community. In this case, the man's head in the beehive is literally in a close-knit community, and he is also staring at the woman, as if he is part of a close-knit community of people staring at her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a double entendre. The first meaning is that the beehive is small, but the second meaning is that the beehive has a lot of bees in it, which creates a sense of community.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's head in the beehive is a reference to the TV show "Lost," in which the character of Hurley wins the lottery and then finds a mysterious numbers station. The joke here is that the small community the man refers to is the beehive itself, which is a lot smaller than the community he was in before (i.e., the world).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is trying to sell the beehive as if it's a house or apartment. Beehives are small, and thus would make for a cramped living space. The joke is also funny because beehives are associated with bees, which are all about community living.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the small size of the bee hive in comparison to the man's head makes it seem like an undesirable living situation. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words: bee hives are known for their sense of community, but in this case, the hive is on the man's head, so it's a more literal sense of community.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is describing the beehive as "small" but also saying that it has a "sense of community", meaning that the bees are all close to each other and work together. However, the joke is also saying that the beehive is small in the sense that it's not a very large or impressive beehive. The contrast between the two meanings of "small" is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the word "hive." A "hive" is both a type of structure where bees live, and a term for a group of bees. In this case, the joke is playing on the double meaning of the word, implying that the man's head in the hive is part of a community of bees.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it uses the double-meaning of the word "community." A community can either refer to a group of people who live close together (like in a small town), or it can refer to a group of animals of the same species that live close together (like in a beehive). In this case, the man in the beehive is using the word to refer to the latter definition, i.e., he is saying that even though the beehive is small, there is still a community of bees inside it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is, presumably, trying to sell the beehive, and is using a normal marketing technique of listing the positive features of the house. However, in this case, the positive feature is that the beehive is small and has a sense of community. This is funny because, while it is true that small communities often do have a strong sense of community, it is an unusual selling point for a beehive, which one would not expect to have a sense of community.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully pokes at the fact that small towns often have a bad reputation for being dull, or that the people who live there are not very interesting. The joke suggests that even the bee hive, which is a very small community, is more interesting because it has a human face. The joke is also clever because it uses a double meaning of the word "community" --- the first meaning is a group of people living in the same place, and the second meaning is a group of bees living in the same hive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "community" can mean a group of people living in the same area, or it can mean a shared living space. In this case, the "community" the man is referring to is the beehive he's living in, which is small, but has a lot of people (bees) in it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is saying that the beehive is small, but it has a sense of community. This is a play on words because "community" can mean both a group of people living together and a place where bees live. Thus, the woman is saying that the beehive is small, but it is still a good place for the bees to live.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the man inside the beehive is hiding, but he's also part of the community of bees in the hive. The woman's comment suggests that even though the man is hidden, he's still found a way to be social and connect with others.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="8.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="10.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
