That one was abominable.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the word "abominable" can refer to both an adjective meaning "hateful" or "horrible," as well as a noun meaning "an abominable snowman." In this case, the joke is a play on words, where the snowman is referred to as both the adjective ("He's not as bad as the last manager") and the noun ("That one was abominable").</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The manager they are referring to is an "abominable snowman," another name for the Yeti, a mythical creature said to live in the Himalayas. The joke is funny because it's unlikely that a Yeti would be a store manager, and even less likely that a store would have two Yeti employees.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Abominable" can mean "very bad," which is how the first woman is describing the snowman. But "abominable" can also refer to the "abominable snowman," which is a mythical creature. So, the joke is also clever because it's cleverly referencing both meanings of the word.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it puns on the word "abominable." Abominable can mean "extremely bad," which would describe a snowman who is a bad manager. However, abominable can also mean "snowman." In this case, the joke is clever because the snowman is both a bad manager and an actual snowman.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The first word, "abominable," means "hateful" or "detestable." However, the second meaning of "abominable" is "of or like a yeti or Bigfoot," an ape-like creature that is supposed to live in the Himalayas. In other words, the joke is saying that the previous manager was so bad that he was like a yeti or Bigfoot, which is a very extreme comparison.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "abominable" can mean "hateful" or "despicable," but it also refers to the Yeti, or "abominable snowman," a legendary creature that is said to live in the Himalayas. In this joke, the Yeti is the previous manager of the store, and the snowman is the current one. The Yeti is said to be a large, hairy, and ferocious creature, so the fact that the snowman is depicted as small, bald, and meek is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the word "abominable" can mean "extremely bad," which is how the woman on the left is describing the snowman on the right, i.e., he's not as bad as the last manager. However, "abominable" also literally means "causing abhorrence," which is how the snowman on the right probably views the woman on the left, given that she's yelling at him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because abominable is another word for horrible, and it also happens to be another word for Snowman. In this instance, the word play is used to make a comparison between the two managers, with the implication being that the previous manager was so bad that they were even worse than a snowman.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the snowman manager may not be the best manager, he's still better than the "abominable" (i.e. very bad) last manager. The joke is a play on words, as "abominable" can also mean "of or relating to a snowman," which is what the manager is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the word "abominable" can mean both "hateful" and "extremely cold." In this context, the snowman is extremely cold, but he's also the new manager, which means he's likely to be horrible (hateful) as well.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the word "abominable" can mean two things. The first meaning is "deserving to be hated", which is how the woman on the left probably feels about the snowman manager. The second meaning is "relating to a Yeti or Bigfoot", which is what the snowman actually is. So, the joke is clever because it's both a pun and a observation about how the Yeti is actually a good store manager, despite popular opinion.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "abominable" can mean both "hateful" and "relating to a snowman." In this context, the word is used in both senses: the previous manager was hateful, and he was also a snowman.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the word "abominable" can mean both "extremely bad" and "relating to a yeti or Bigfoot," which is fitting given that the Snowman is a creature made of snow. The joke also plays on the fact that "snowman" is a homophone for "snowman," which amplifies the comedic effect.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the word "abominable," which means "very bad." In this case, the speaker is referring to the previous manager, who was so bad that he was like an abominable snowman: a creature that is made of snow and is thus very cold.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because abominable means " disgusting" or "horrible." In this case, it's a play on words because the former manager was an abominable snowman, which is a creature made entirely of snow.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="236.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="238.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
