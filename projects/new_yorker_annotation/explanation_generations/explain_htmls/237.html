The therapist is acting like the man's actions are normal, when in reality, they are very strange. The therapist's response also suggests that he doesn't understand what the man is saying, which is ironic given that he's a therapist.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is in a therapist's office, and is being asked about why he's holding up two Scottish flags. The therapist assumes that the man is having some sort of sexual issues because of the flags, when in reality the man is just Scottish and is proud of his heritage.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is trying to get the man to talk about his feelings by saying that many of her patients have difficulty talking about sex. The man, in response, is standing on the couch holding up two Scottish flags. The flags are a visual pun for "testicles," which are another word for testicles.
