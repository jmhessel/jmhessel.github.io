Trump Tower is a well-known building in New York City, and it is often considered to be an eyesore. Thus, the speaker is saying that, while living next to a church steeple may not be ideal, it is better than living next to Trump Tower.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on top of the church is going to great lengths to avoid living next to Trump Tower. Trump Tower is a symbol of wealth and excess, and the man on top of the church is presumably poor and doesn't want to be around that kind of wealth. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the saying "the grass is always greener on the other side."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man on the church steeple is watching the woman who is on the phone. The woman is living in an apartment next to the church. The man on the steeple is saying that it is better to live next to the church than to live next to Trump Tower. This is a play on words because "to live next to the church" can mean to live a good and moral life, whereas "to live next to Trump Tower" would be to live a life of luxury and decadence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the church steeple is choosing to live in an precarious and impractical position (on the top of a church steeple) instead of living next to Trump Tower. This is humorous because it would be considered foolish to live on the top of a church steeping, as opposed to living in a Trump Tower, which is a much more luxurious and practical option.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two situations are contrasting. The woman is doing a normal, every day activity --- watering plants. In contrast, the man is doing something unusual: he's climbing the church. The joke is making a comparison between the two activities, and saying that the man's activity is more interesting, or "beats" the woman's activity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's situation is so bizarre (he's living on top of a cathedral) that it seems like it would be preferable to living next to Trump Tower, which is a controversial building in New York City. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: "beats living" could mean either "is better than living" or "makes a noise that is louder than living." In this case, it's both.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the church steeple is presumably there because he wants to get away from something, and the woman on the phone is presumably complaining about her living situation. The man on the church steeple is living in a much more precarious and dangerous situation than the woman on the phone, but he still says that it's better than living next to Trump Tower. The joke is making a political statement about how living next to Trump Tower is not as desirable as it seems.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because living next to Trump Tower is generally considered to be a luxury, but in this context, it's clear that the speaker would rather live next to the church, where a man is perched on top like a bird, than Trump Tower. This is because living next to Trump Tower would be less restful, given the constant sounds of bells from the church.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "beat" can mean to hit something repeatedly, but it can also mean to surpass or be better than something. In this case, the man on top of the church is saying that living on top of the church beats (is better than) living next to Trump Tower. The joke is also a jab at Trump, who is often associated with greed, corruption, and racism.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it points out the ridiculousness of the situation. The man is perched precariously on the top of a church steeple, which is dangerous and could result in death. The fact that he's doing this just to get a better view of the woman on the phone is silly, and the fact that he prefers this to living next to Trump Tower just points to how unreasonable his actions are.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Trump Tower is a well-known building in New York City, and it is known for being a place where wealthy people live. The joke is implying that the man on the church steeple is poor, and that he would rather live in a place with a view of the woman on the phone than in a wealthy building like Trump Tower.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "beats" can mean to be superior to or to be better than. In this case, the man on the steeple is saying that living next to the church beats living next to Trump Tower. The joke is also funny because it is a dig at Trump Tower, which is often considered an eyesore.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common saying "it's not perfect, but it beats the alternative." In this case, the man is not living in the perfect situation (he's living on the edge of a church instead of in an apartment), but it beats living next to Trump Tower, which is a play on how living near Trump Tower is often considered less than ideal because of the high rents and the association with the controversial political figure.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the man's living situation (on top of a church) is strange, it is a far better situation than living next to Trump Tower, which is a more mainstream/normal thing. In other words, the joke is saying that the man's strange situation is actually preferable to a more normal one.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the steeple is choosing to live in an uncomfortable and unusual situation because it is preferable to living next to Trump Tower. Trump Tower is a controversial building because of its association with US President Donald Trump.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="236.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="238.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
