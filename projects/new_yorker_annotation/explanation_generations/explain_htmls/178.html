Most people would be freaked out if they were walking on the beach and a whale landed on top of them, but the person in this situation seems more concerned with getting insurance information so they can file a claim. This joke highlights the absurdity of the situation: a person being trapped underneath a large whale is completely outlandish, yet the person's reaction is completely mundane.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. Usually, when two people are in an accident, they exchange insurance information so they can file a claim. In this case, the person who was just killed by the whale cannot exchange insurance information because he is dead. The joke is also funny because it is a non-sequitur: the insurance information exchange is a totally unrelated topic to the fact that a whale is stranded on an island.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because insurance companies would not typically cover fallen palm trees or Flipper arriving on your doorstep. In this case, the joke is even funnier because the giant sperm whale is beached on top of the person, which would make it even more difficult (and dangerous) to exchange insurance information.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because insurance companies are only liable for damages caused by accidents, and not for damages caused by natural disasters. However, if a whale were to randomly beach itself on top of a person and a tree, it would technically be classified as an accident, making the insurance company liable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the whale is beached on the island, the man is still treating it like a car accident. This is absurd because, even though the whale is technically on "land", it's still a whale, and exchanging insurance information is not something that would typically happen in this situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the whale is beached on the island, and the person is worried about exchanging insurance information in case the whale damages their property. The insurance joke is clever because it's a play on the phrase "exchanging information", which is often used when two people collide (like in a car accident), but in this case, it's a whale that's beached on an island.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is stuck under a sperm whale, which is a very large and heavy animal. The insurance information is usually exchanged after car accidents, which are much smaller in scale. The man is asking for insurance information in this case because he's hoping that the other person's insurance will cover the damages from the whale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because if a whale landed on top of a person, it would obviously kill them. However, the idea of exchanging insurance information is typically something that people do after a more mundane car accident, not after being crushed by a massive mammal. The joke is exaggerated and absurd, which is why it's funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though it is unusual for a whale to be stranded on such a small island, the speaker is treating the situation as if it were a car accident, where two drivers would exchange insurance information. The joke is poking fun at the mundanity of the reaction to a very strange event.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the typical reaction people have after getting into a car accident. Instead of the normal concept of "swapping insurance information", the joke is that the person wants to exchange information with the whale. Given that the whale is beached on an island, this is probably not possible.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non-sequitur. In the context of a car accident, it would make sense to exchange insurance information. But in this context, with a whale beached on an island, it is silly to try and exchange insurance information.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's legs are sticking out from underneath the whale, and it's implied that he's dead. The joke is a play on the fact that usually when two people have a car accident, they will exchange insurance information. In this case, the insurance information would be exchanged between the man and the whale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the scene is bizarre, the two people seem to be taking the situation in stride. They are calmly talking to each other as if beached whales were a common occurrence. The joke highlights the absurdity of the situation by having the two people exchange insurance information, as if this were a routine car accident.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, when two cars collide, the drivers usually exchange insurance information. However, in this case, it's a whale that has beached itself on an island, and the island is much smaller than the whale. Thus, the insurance information joke is a way of pointing out the absurdity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to car accidents. When two cars collide, the driver's often exchange insurance information. However, in this case, it's a whale that has beached on an island, so the island would be considered the "driver" of the whale, and thus would be liable for the damages.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="177.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="179.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
