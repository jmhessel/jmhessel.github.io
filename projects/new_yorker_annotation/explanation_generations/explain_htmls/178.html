But it's not statistically significant.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the ability of the rat to build and operate a jet pack is an impressive feat, but the scientific method requires data from multiple rats to be considered statistically significant. In other words, the fact that this one rat was able to do it isn't enough to change the scientific consensus that rats can't build and operate jet packs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The rat is trying to get the cheese, which is a goal, but the scientists are not interested in whether or not the rat gets the cheese. They are only interested in whether or not the rat's use of the jetpack is statistically significant, i.e., whether it is a reliable method that can be used to test their hypothesis. The joke is that the scientists are more interested in the data than the rat's welfare.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two scientists are impressed by the fact that their rat has a jetpack, but they are not impressed enough to acknowledge that it might be statistically significant. This is because, while the rat with a jetpack is a cool gimmick, it's not likely to be representative of the population as a whole.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two scientists are more interested in whether or not the rat's actions are statistically significant, rather than the fact that the rat has built and is operating a jet pack. This is funny because it's a deeply unimpressive use of a jet pack, and yet the scientists are only interested in its potential implications for their data, rather than the sheer spectacle of it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The rat in the maze is trying to get to the cheese, which is a common goal for rats. The fact that the rat has a jet pack is unusual, but the scientists are more interested in whether or not the rat's ability to fly is statistically significant. In other words, they want to know if the rat's success in getting to the cheese is due to chance or if the jet pack is actually making a difference.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the scientific method generally prizes statistical significance above all else. A single rat with a jetpack is an impressive feat, but it's not statistically significant, meaning that it's not a reliable data point on which to make conclusions. The joke is poking fun at the importance that scientists place on statistics.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two scientists are treating the rat's use of a jetpack to bypass the maze as if it's not a big deal. In their minds, the rat is simply taking a shortcut that isn't representative of the population as a whole. This is humorous because it's a play on the phrase "that's not statistically significant," which is often used to dismiss something as being unimportant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rat's use of a jet pack is a clear departure from reality. Jet packs are not something that rats - or any other animals - use in real life. In the context of the lab, the joke is poking fun at the idea of doing something simply because it's cool, without considering if it's actually useful or helpful. The joke suggests that the scientists are more interested in the novelty of the rat's jet pack than its utility.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two scientists are observing a rat making its way through a maze to find cheese, but instead of following the maze, the rat has just built a jetpack and flown straight to the cheese. One of the scientists says that it's cool, but the other says that it's not statistically significant. The joke is funny because it's unexpected that the rat would have the ability to build a jetpack, and it's also unexpected that the second scientist would be more concerned with the statistical significance of the rat's behavior than the fact that the rat can fly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rat is using a jetpack to get to the cheese, which is a very unusual method. The scientists observing the rat are unimpressed, because while it's a unusual method, it's not statistically significant, i.e., it's not a method that could be used to reach a generalizable conclusion.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rat is doing something extraordinary by flying through the maze with a jetpack, but the scientists are unimpressed because it's only one rat, and thus the results are not statistically significant. This is a play on the fact that often, in science, one result is not enough to prove a theory; statistically significant results are needed from a large sample size.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rat has made a significant achievement --- it has learned to build and operate a jet pack --- but the scientist dismisses it as unimportant because it's just one rat. In other words, the fact that this one rat has figured out how to fly doesn't mean that all rats can or will do so.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the scientists are treating the rat like it's a test subject in an experiment, and not like a living creature. The rat is trying to get the cheese, but the scientists are more interested in whether the rat's method of getting the cheese is statistically significant. This is a play on the fact that, in science experiments, test subjects (often rats or mice) are treated as expendable and their welfare is often secondary to the data that can be collected from them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rat is using a jetpack to fly through the maze, which is a very significant achievement. However, the scientists are not impressed because it's only one rat, and thus, the result is not statistically significant. This is a joke about how scientists can sometimes be dismissive of results that are not significant from a statistical standpoint, even if those results are very significant in other ways.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rat has just done something incredibly impressive --- building and operating a jet pack to skip the maze --- but one of the scientists is unimpressed, because it's just one rat and not enough to draw any broad conclusions from.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
