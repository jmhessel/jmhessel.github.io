If the reptile is trying to communicate using hieroglyphs, the cavemen are probably not going to be able to understand it. This is similar to how someone from a different country might not be able to understand someone else's grocery list, because it would be in a different language.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two cavemen are worried that the lizard is trying to communicate with them, but they can't understand what he's trying to say. If the lizard is trying to make a grocery list, it would be difficult for the cavemen to interpret, since they wouldn't know what the items on the list are. This joke pokes fun at the idea that cavemen were not very intelligent.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, if the dinosaur is smart enough to draw crude images of horses and cavemen on the cave wall, then it's likely that he is also smart enough to make a grocery list --- a list which, if found by the cavemen, would be of great use to them. However, the fact that the dinosaur is drawing HS& Cavemen, rather than something more useful, implies that he is not as smart as they thought, and the joke is therefore funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cavemen are worried that if the prehistoric reptile is just making a grocery list, then they are in trouble. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the word "hieroglyph" can mean both a ancient Egyptian symbol and a carved image. So, the cavemen are worried that the reptile is just making a list of things to buy at the grocery store, rather than a hieroglyph, which would be much more significant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because if the lizard is trying to communicate via cave painting, then it's likely that he is trying to tell the cavemen where to find food. This would be difficult to do since lizards don't have opposable thumbs and can't write. The cavemen would be in trouble if the grocery list was the only thing the lizard was trying to communicate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cavemen are worried that the reptile is making a grocery list. The grocery list is a reminder of the things that the cavemen need to hunt and gather in order to survive. If the reptile is making the list, it means that the cavemen are not the only ones who need to worry about food. The reptile is probably not making a grocery list, but the cavemen don't know that.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "list" can mean two things: a grocery list (a list of food items to buy), or a perusal (looking at something). In this case, the caveman is worried that the lizard is making a grocery list, because that would mean that the lizard is planning to eat them. However, it's more likely that the lizard is just looking at them (i.e., making a perusal), and not making a grocery list.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "if it's a grocery list" can mean either that the person is hoping it's not a grocery list (because that would be boring), or that the person ishoping it is a grocery list (because then they would know what the lizard is trying to communicate). In this case, the latter interpretation is funnier because it would mean that the cavemen are in trouble if the lizard is actually trying to communicate a grocery list. The former interpretation is still funny, but in a more confusing way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cavemen are worried that the dinosaur is trying to write a grocery list, which would be very difficult for the dinosaur to do because he is not smart enough to write. This is a play on the fact that cavemen are often depicted as being not very smart, so it would be difficult for them to understand the grocery list even if the dinosaur could write it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the Flintstones cartoon, where the main characters are Cavemen. In that show, the Flintstones live in a town that is a parody of modern society, but with Stone Age technology. If the lizard is making a grocery list, that would mean that he is making a list of things he needs to buy, which would be a modern concept. Thus, the joke is that the two cavemen are worried that the lizard is more advanced than they are.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because if the dinosaurs were smart enough to do cave drawings, they would likely be able to communicate in a more sophisticated way than grunting. This would be a problem for the cavemen, who would then have to compete with the dinosaurs for resources. The joke implies that the cavemen are not worried about the dinosaur's drawings because they are simply horses and cavemen, not a complex grocery list.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dinosaur is creating what appear to be stick figures of cavemen and horses on the cave wall. The cavemen are worried that the dinosaur is drawing a grocery list, because if the dinosaur is that smart, they must be in trouble. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words: the cavemen are worried that the dinosaur is creating a "shopping list", which is another word for a grocery list.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The term "if it's a grocery list" can mean two things: first, that the caveman is hoping the lizard is drawing a grocery list because that would be useful. However, the term can also mean that the caveman is hoping the lizard isn't drawing a grocery list, because if he is, it means he's planning to eat the cavemen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the cavemen is worried that the dinosaur is trying to communicate something to them, but if it's just a grocery list, then it's not as concerning. This is silly because it's unlikely that the dinosaurs would be drawing anything, let alone a grocery list, on the cave wall.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. If the dinosaur is drawing a grocery list, then the cavemen are in trouble because they need food. However, if the dinosaur is drawing a picture of a grocery store, then the cavemen are in trouble because they need to find a way to get to the store. The joke is clever because it's not immediately clear which meaning is intended, but both are funny.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="196.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="198.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
