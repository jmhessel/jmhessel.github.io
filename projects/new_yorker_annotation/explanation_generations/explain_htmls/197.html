The joke is a play on words because "suited" can mean either "dressed for the occasion" or "compatible." In this case, the former meaning is more accurate, as the two are not actually compatible (as evidenced by the fact that one is an astronaut and the other is a diver).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the astronaut and the diver are both wearing their work clothes, which are suits designed for very different environments: space and water. The fact that they are at a party together implies that they have come from different places and have little in common, except for the fact that they are both wearing suits. The drunk woman admiring the astronaut's pack is also funny because it implies that she is more interested in the astronaut's work equipment than the astronaut himself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The astronaut and diver are "oddly suited" because they are both wearing their work clothes, which are not typical party attire. The joke is also a play on the fact that the astronaut and diver have very different jobs: an astronaut works in space, while a diver works in water. The fact that they are both at the same party is strange, and the joke capitalizes on that strangeness.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="196.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="198.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
