You'll be working in bonds.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it uses a play on words. The phrase "in stocks" can refer to a financial term, meaning that a company's shares are being traded on a stock exchange. In this case, the man is literally in stocks, as in the device used to punish people by immobilizing them. The woman's remark about working in bonds is another financial pun: in this case, bonds are a type of investment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in stocks is named Ken, which could be short for Kenneth. The other man says that he will be working in bonds, which is a type of financial security. The joke is clever because it doesn't just substitute one word for the other, but it uses the homophones "Ken" and "Bond" to create a pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The first meaning of "bonds" is financial bonds, which is what the man is telling the woman she will be working with. The second meaning of "bonds" is the physical restraint that the other office worker, Ken, is in. The joke is clever because it is difficult to think of two meanings of the same word that are more opposite from each other.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words.

The man in the stocks is named Ken, and the punster is saying that the people who are not in the stocks (i.e., not being punished) will be working in the bonds department.

The man in stocks is named Ken, which is short for Kennedy. The woman is walking into the Bond Trading Company. The joke is that the woman is going to be working in the bond market, while Ken is going to be in the stocks (i.e., he's going to be a stockbroker).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the stocks is named Ken, and he is restrained in a way that is commonly associated with the medieval era. The joke is that the other man will be working in bonds, which is a type of financial instrument, rather than being restrained in the stocks.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in stocks is named Ken, which could be short for Kenneth. The other man says he will be working in bonds, which is a type of financial investment. The joke is clever because it is both a pun and a warning: the man in stocks is in a bad situation (pun), and the other man is saying that he could be next if he doesn't watch out (warning).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the stocks is named Ken and he is in stocks (as in the financial sense of the word). The other man will be working in bonds (also in the financial sense of the word). This is funny because it is a clever way to use the financial terms to make a joke about someone being punished.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in stocks is named Ken, and he is in stocks because he presumably did something bad at work. The woman assures the other man that he will be working in bonds, which is a different financial instrument. However, the word "bonds" can also mean "handcuffs," which implies that the woman is sending the man off to be handcuffed as well.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in stocks is named Ken, and the woman is going to be working in bonds (which are a type of investment). The joke is also clever because it's a double entendre; not only is it a play on words, but it's also a reference to the fact that people used to be put in stocks as a form of punishment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in stocks is named Ken, and the woman is going to work in the bond department. Ken is in "stocks," while the woman will be working with "bonds." This is a clever way of saying that the woman will have a more stable job than the man, who is in a position of being ridiculed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of the word "stocks": the financial stocks, which are a type of investment, and the physical stocks, which is the punishment device that the workers are joking about. The joke is clever because it's a play on words, and it's also a pun, which is a type of humor that relies on words that have multiple meanings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is reassuring the woman that she will not be punished like the man in stocks by working in bonds, which is a completely different financial instrument. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the fact that the two people are in a modern office, and yet there is a man in stocks, which is a very old-fashioned form of punishment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of office work, the word "bonds" usually refers to financial bonds. However, in this context, the woman is going to be "working in bonds" as in, she will be working with the man who is in stocks, i.e., she will be his assistant. The joke is a play on words, as the two different meanings of "bonds" create a humorous incongruity.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="162.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="164.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
