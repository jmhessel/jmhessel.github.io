Hairy, Harry.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The first man's name is Harry and the second man is covered in hair. The joke relies on the fact that the two things sound alike to be funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is making a pun on the names of the two people he is introducing. The names "Harry" and "Hairy" are both words that describe hairiness, so the man is playing on that similarity for a laugh.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is clearly not human, yet he is at a human social event. The fact that his name is "Harry" makes the joke even funnier, because it is a human name that doesn't suit him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man introduces the two individuals by saying "Harry, hairy. Hairy, Harry." The first Harry is a person's name, while the second Harry is an adjective meaning "covered in hair." The joke is clever because it uses the homophones "hairy" and "Harry" to create a pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The two men's names are similar sounding, so the business man is making a pun by saying "Harry, hairy. Hairy, Harry." In addition, the joke is funny because it's unexpected. It's not common to see a sasquatch at a house party, so the image is surprising.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men are making a formal introduction, yet the subject of the introduction is a sasquatch, which is not a human. The joke is clever because it uses a play on words --- "hairy" and "Harry" --- to make the introduction seem more normal than it is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The business man is introducing his colleague to the sasquatch, and he makes a pun on their names. This is a relatively light-hearted and innocuous joke, compared to some of the other ones.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The hairy man's name is Harry, and the joke is repeating his name and making a pun about his hairiness.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is introducing two individuals, one named Harry and the other named Hairy. However, because Hairy is an animal, the man's introduction is also a description of what Hairy looks like. The joke is clever because it is both a play on words and a visual pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The business man is introducing his colleague to the sasquatch, whose name is Harry. However, because "hairy" is another word for "sasquatch", the business man's introduction is also a way of saying that the sasquatch is hairy. This pun is humorous because it is a play on the words "hairy" and "sasquatch", which are both related to the creature being introduced.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the businessman is treating the sasquatch like a business colleague, even though the sasquatch is a mythical creature. The joke is also a play on words, as the names "Harry" and "Hairy" sound similar.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the foreground is introducing two people, Harry and Hairy. However, Hairy is not a person, he is an animal. The joke is funny because it is a play on the words Harry and Hairy and the fact that one is a person and the other is an animal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the hairy man's name is Harry, so the two words sound the same. This is a pun, which is a type of joke that uses words that sound the same but have different meanings. In this case, the two words are "hairy" and "Harry."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man introducing the two individuals says "Harry, hairy. Hairy, Harry." The first "Harry" is the name of the man, and the second "hairy" is describing the animal. The second "Hairy" is the name of the animal, and the first "hairy" is describing the man. Therefore, the joke is a play on words between the names "Harry" and "Hairy".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man introducing the two people says "Harry, hairy. Hairy, Harry." This is a pun because the two men have the same name, but one is hairy and the other is not. The joke is also clever because it's a play on the phrase "Mary, merry. Merry, Mary."</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
