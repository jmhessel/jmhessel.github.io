They'll just keep bringing in a new judge.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the phrase "a jury of your peers." The joke is that, if the Grim Reaper is on trial, his peers would be other supernatural beings, and not humans. Therefore, even if he is found guilty by a jury of his peers, they can just keep bringing in new judges until they find one that lets him off.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common phrase "you can't fight City Hall." In this case, the lawyer is trying to tell the Grim Reaper that even if he wins his case, he will just be replaced by another judge, because the court system is bigger than any one person.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the Grim Reaper has been appearing in courtrooms for a long time, and has had many lawyers, but they have all failed to get him acquitted. The joke also highlights the irony of the Grim Reaper, who is responsible for death, being on trial.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "to bring in a new judge" often means to have a new person preside over a case, but in this instance, the lawyer is telling Death to stop killing judges because they'll just keep getting replaced.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the grim reaper is trying to get out of his court case by killing the judge. However, since he is death, this isn't an effective strategy, as the judge will just be replaced by a new one.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. A judge is a person who presides over a court, but in this case, the client is the Grim Reaper, who personifies death. The lawyer is telling Death to stop killing people, as they will just keep bringing in a new judge (presumably meaning, a new person to preside over the court).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the client is Death, who is often associated with the Grim Reaper. The Grim Reaper is often pictured as a skeleton with a hood, which can be interpreted to look like a judge. Therefore, the lawyer's statement that "they'll just keep bringing in a new judge" is amusing because it's a play on words --- in reality, the lawyer knows that the judge will eventually die, but the joke is that he's trying to downplay Death's impact by saying that a new judge will simply take the old judge's place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "keep bringing in a new jury." In a criminal trial, if the jury is deadlocked (i.e., can't come to a unanimous decision), the judge can declare a mistrial and bring in a new jury. But, of course, if the client is Death, then jury pool is kind of limited.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the grim reaper, who is normally associated with death, is on trial. The lawyer tells him to stop what he is doing, because even if they kill the judge, there will just be another one. The lawyer is effectively saying that, even though the grim reaper is normally associated with death, in this courtroom, he is powerless.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that the Grim Reaper is usually associated with death, and death is usually permanent. However, in this case, the Grim Reaper is in a courtroom being represented by a lawyer, which suggests that death may not be as final as we think. The joke relies on the premise that if death can be challenged in court, then it must not be permanent.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it play off the idea of death being inevitable. No matter how often death occurs, there will always be more people, and hence more death. The lawyer's client is death personified, so the lawyer is trying to argue that death is unstoppable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the grim reaper, who is exempt from the laws that govern mortals, is being told by his lawyer to stop killing people in court. The joke is ironic because the grim reaper's job is to guide people's souls to the afterlife, so by killing people in court, he is actually doing them a favor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "you can't fight City Hall." The point of the joke is that, even if the Grim Reaper wins his case in court, it's not going to matter because there will always be another judge (and another court case) waiting for him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the grim reaper is trying to get out of his court case by saying that, no matter what happens, he will just keep killing the judge. This is ironic because, in most court cases, the hope is that the judge will rule in your favor; in this case, the Grim Reaper is hoping that the judge will rule against him so that he can kill them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "to keep someone in line" usually means to make sure someone follows the rules, but in this case, the lawyer is telling his client (Death) to stop killing judges because they'll just keep bringing in new ones.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="34.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="36.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
