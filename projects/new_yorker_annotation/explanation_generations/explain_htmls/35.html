The realtor is telling the couple that the neighborhood is "expanding" which has two meanings. First, that more houses are being built and so it's a good time to buy.

But, because they are in space, the neighborhood is literally expanding: as new planets and stars are formed, they are added to the "neighborhood." The couple might not want to live in a neighborhood that is constantly expanding and changing, so the realtor's comment is not as reassuring as he intended it to be.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The realtor is saying that the couple should keep in mind that the neighborhood is expanding, which means that there will be more houses and people in the area. However, because they are in space, the realtor's words can be interpreted to mean that the neighborhood is literally expanding, as in, the physical space around them is getting larger.
