This is a play on words because "going down" can mean both going downstairs to a lower floor, or going down on someone, i.e., performing oral sex. In this case, the person is saying that he would have to go downstairs to be sure that the bartender is not just a hallucination, but is actually a giant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The person in the bar is saying that the bartender's head looks like it could be the head of a giant, but he would have to go down a few floors to be sure, meaning that he would have to go down to the giant's floor to be sure that the bartender is actually a giant. But of course, the person in the bar is just making a joke and is not actually going to go down to the giant's floor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because people often say that someone "has a big head" to mean that they are conceited or have an inflated ego. In this instance, the person literally has a giant head, so the idiom is taken very literally. The person making the joke is saying that he would have to go down three floors (i.e., leave the bar) to confirm whether or not the person he's talking to is the conceited person he thinks he is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is worried that the man sitting next to her at the bar is the giant whose face is behind the counter. The man assures her that he would have to go down three floors to be sure, meaning that he would have to be much taller than he currently is to be the giant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of the words "resemblance" and "uncanny." The first meaning is that the two people look very similar, as if they could be twins. The second meaning is that the Giant is so huge that he would have to go down several floors of the building to get a closer look at the two people, who are very small.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is worried that the giant behind the bar is his doppelganger, or look-alike. He says he would have to go down three floors to be sure, implying that the giant is so tall that he must live or work on one of the lower floors of the building.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is implying that the bartender's head is so big that it might actually be the head of a giant, and he would have to go down to the giant's feet to be sure. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the phrase "I would have to go down on my knees to be sure," which has a different meaning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's statement is ambiguous. It could either mean that he needs to go down to the floor below him to get a closer look, or it could mean that he would have to go down three flights of stairs to get to the patio where the people are sitting. But, given the context, it's more likely that he means he needs to go down three floors to get a closer look at the tiny people, which would be an odd thing to say unless he thought they were hallucinating.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is saying that the two tiny people look like they could be related to him, but he's not certain. The word "resemblance" can mean both a similarity in appearance and a family relationship. But in order to be certain, he would have to go down three floors because the two tiny people are actually on a different floor of the building, i.e., they aren't really related to him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it references the giant head behind the counter, which the speaker thinks looks like somebody they know. The speaker says they would have to go down three floors to be sure, meaning they would have to go down to the person's apartment to see if it is actually them, which is a long way to go to confirm what is probably just a coincidence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is not sure if the giant face behind the bar is real or just a figment of his imagination. He is afraid to go down to the lower floors to check, because he doesn't want to confirm that the giant face is real and he is hallucinating.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is not sure if the man sitting nearby is her husband or not, but she is sure that he resembles her husband. The waiter's 10 times larger face behind the bar counter is a hallucination, which makes it harder for her to judge the man's resemblance to her husband.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is saying that, while the waiter looks like the giant from the fairy tale "Jack and the Beanstalk", he would have to go down to the giant's floor to be sure. This is funny because it's a play on words: the man is saying that he would have to go down to the giant's floor to confirm that the waiter is the giant, but "going down" can also mean drinking alcohol, which is why the man has a drink in his hand.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the person might be joking about the size of the head, they are also making a reference to the floor number in the building where the person with the giant head lives. Uncanny means strange or mysterious, so the person is saying that it's strange that the person with the giant head would be working in a bar, and they would have to go to their apartment to be sure that it's really them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is clearly worried about the man she's with, who seems to be hallucinating and seeing a giant behind the bar. She tries to play along and act like she sees the giant too, but she is clearly uncomfortable with the situation.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
