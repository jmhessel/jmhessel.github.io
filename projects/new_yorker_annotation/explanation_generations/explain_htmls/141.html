The man with the controller is a salesman, and he's telling potential customers that the TV comes with its own remote --- meaning that the customer won't have to get up to change the channel or volume, they can just use the controller. However, the joke is that the controller is so big, it's basically its own remote. Thus, the customer would have to get up to change the channel or volume anyway, negating the purpose of the controller.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the remote is essentially offering it for sale. The joke is a play on words because the "remote" can refer to both the distance the TV is from the person holding the controller, and the controller itself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The remote control that the salesman is showing the father and son is so large that it could easily be used as a remote control for the television. The joke is that the remote is so big, it comes with its own remote control.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The remote control is so large that it comes with its own remote control, which is a smaller version of the big remote. The joke is also clever because it's a play on the idea that many electronic devices today come with a remote control.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The remote control is so large that it comes with its own remote control, which is to say, a smaller remote control that can be used to operate the larger one. This is absurd because it would be much easier to just have one, big remote control.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the literal interpretation of the word "remote." In this case, the remote is so big that it can't be carried around without its own remote. The joke is also a play on words, because the remote control comes with its own remote control, which the father and son may not be able to operate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "remote": first, the remote control is so large that it can be used to control the men in the store; second, the remote is a remote control for the TV, implying that the men in the store are so engrossed in their TV that they need a remote to change the channel.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the remote is clearly trying to sell the huge TV controller to the customers, but the joke is that it comes with its own remote, which is unnecessary. The joke is clever because it's a play on words --- the man is trying to sell the remote, but the joke is that the remote is useless because it comes with its own remote.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the remote control is so big that it comes with its own remote control. This remote control is implied to be normal sized, which makes it even funnier because it would be absurdly impractical to have to use two remote controls to operate one device.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the remote control is so large that it is the size of a person. The implication is that the customer would need another remote control to operate the first one, which is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is asking if the remote control comes with its own remote, meaning a smaller remote that can be used to control the giant remote. But the worker misinterprets this as meaning whether the giant remote comes with a remote control to turn it off and on --- which, of course, it does, because it's a remote control.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is holding a giant remote control, which would obviously be used for a giant TV. The fact that he has to use a remote to control the TV implies that the TV is very large. This is a play on the fact that many electronics come with remote controls these days, even though they might not be necessary.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is so large that he can't fit through the door of the store with the TV remote control. The remote is a necessary part of the TV, yet he can't even bring it into the store. The joke is a play on the fact that people are often surprised by how large the TV remote controls can be.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "remote." The first meaning is that the remote is so large that it requires its own remote to control it; the second meaning is that the remote is remote-controlled, i.e., it can be controlled from a distance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is so excited about the big TV remote that he neglects to mention that the TV set comes with its own remote. The remote is thus superfluous, but the man is either unaware of this or doesn't want to admit it. Either way, it's a funny situation.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
