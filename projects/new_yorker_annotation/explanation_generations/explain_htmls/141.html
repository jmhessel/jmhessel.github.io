This is humorous because it is not a common occurrence to have birds attacking a person, and the reaction of the second man implies that he thinks this is a tame, every day event.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "Shall I keep reading?" and "Shall I keep feeding?" In this case, the man covered in birds is being asked if the other man should continue reading, or if he should continue feeding the birds. The fact that the man is covered in birds makes it clear that he's been doing the latter.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man covered in birds is clearly in a strange and dangerous situation, but the man with the book is acting like it's completely normal. This is a play on the idea that people who are reading are so absorbed in their book that they don't notice what's going on around them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is covered in birds has clearly been there for a while, and the other man is still reading his book. The man covered in birds is likely being used as a feeding station for the birds, which is a common practice, but it's strange that the other man is just sitting there reading while his friend is being used as bird food.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, although the man being attacked by the birds is in a clearly dangerous and uncomfortable situation, the other man calmly asks if he should continue reading his book. The man being attacked by the birds is likely in a state of shock, and the other man's total disregard for his safety is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the man being attacked by birds is in a potentially dangerous situation, the other man is more interested in his book than in helping him. The joke relies on the assumption that the man being attacked by birds is not in any real danger, since birds are typically not dangerous to humans, and so the reader can laugh at the idea of the man being more concerned with his book than with the man's safety.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man reading the book is asking if he should continue reading, but the man covered in birds is also a book, and thus the first man is asking if he should keep reading that book. The second meaning of the question is if the man should continue reading despite the fact that there are birds all over him, which is a strange situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the saying "ignorance is bliss." In this case, the man who is being attacked by birds is probably experiencing a lot of pain, and the other man who is reading is blissfully unaware of what is happening. The joke is clever because it is a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man being attacked by birds is in a predicament where it would be best if someone helped him, but the other man just wants to keep reading and doesn't want to be bothered. The fact that the man is being covered in birds is also humorous because it's an unexpected twist on a normal situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man being attacked by birds is in a situation where it would normally be helpful to have someone else around, but the other man isn't doing anything to help him. He's just sitting there reading, and when asked if he should keep reading, he nonchalantly says yes, as if the man being attacked by birds isn't a big deal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man covered in birds is clearly not in a position to keep reading, given that he is covered in birds. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the fact that many people believe that birds are attracted to people who are reading.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man covered in birds is clearly in a compromising position, and yet the other man asks if he should keep reading. This is ridiculous because, clearly, the man covered in birds needs help, and yet the other man is more concerned with his own reading.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is being attacked by the birds is in a very precarious and dangerous situation, yet his friend seems completely unphased and is more concerned with whether or not he should continue reading his book. This Highlights the absurdity of the situation: that a man is being savagely attacked by birds and his friend is acting like it's no big deal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is being attacked by the birds is not in a normal situation, and the other man is choosing to just keep reading his book instead of helping him. The joke is emphasizing the absurdity of the situation by pointing out how nonchalant the other man is being.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who is not being attacked by the birds seems very nonchalant about the whole situation. He is so nonchalant, in fact, that he doesn't even bother to look up from his book as his friend is being pecked to death. This is unexpected because, in most scenarios, if someone is being attacked, the other person would try to help.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="140.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="142.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
