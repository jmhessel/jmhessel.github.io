The joke is clever because it's a play on words - the first man is asking for help to get a tighter butt, but the second man says he can only show him the way to a tighter butt (i.e. not help him directly).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the old man is sitting on an exercise ball, which is often used for working out one's butt. The old man is telling the backpacker that he can't help him find the way down the mountain, but he can help him find a tight butt, which is a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the hermit is sitting on what looks like an exercise ball, which is often used for workouts that aim to improve one's physical appearance, such as by toning the butt. Thus, the hermit's words imply that, even though he cannot help the explorer find the answer to his question, he can at least help him improve his physical appearance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because when the backpacker asks the hermit if he's been to the top of the mountain, the hermit responds with an offer to show him the path to a "tighter butt." This is a non-sequitur because the two things are unrelated.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the hermit's choice of seat, an exercise ball, is an ironic contrast to the usual stereotype of a hermit living a rustic, simple lifestyle. Furthermore, the joke plays on the double meaning of the word "path": the hermit could be offering to show the explorer the way to go (a physical path), or he could be offering advice on how to improve one's health (a metaphorical path).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man on the mountain is sitting on a green yoga ball, which is an exercise ball. The other man asks if he can sit on the yoga ball, and the man on the yoga ball says that he can't sit on the ball, but he can show the other man the path to a tighter butt. This is a double meaning, as the man on the yoga ball is saying that he can't sit on the ball (because it's being used as an exercise tool), but he can show the other man how to get a tighter butt (by using the exercise ball).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the explorer is looking for the path to the top of the mountain, but the hermit is instead offering to show the explorer a path to a "tighter butt." This is a play on words because "tighten your butt" is a common idiom meaning to focus and pay attention, which is not what the hermit is offering to do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the yoga ball is presumably offering to help the other man with his quest, but instead of helping him, he makes a joke about how the quest will lead to a "tighter butt." This is a play on words, as the man on the yoga ball is telling the other man that the quest will be good for his physical health, but also implying that the other man's quest is pointless.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The explorer is asking the hermit if he has found the secret to happiness, and the hermit replied that he has not found the secret to happiness, but he can show the explorer a path to a tighter butt, meaning a path to physical fitness. This is ironic because usually, it is the explorer who is in better shape, not the hermit.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the exercise ball is often used as a way to get a tight butt, and the hermit is offering the explorer a way to get a tight butt.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the hermit is offering the explorer a weird solution to their inquiry. The answer to the explorer's question is no, but the hermit misunderstood and thought they were asking for a way to get a tighter butt, which the hermit believes the exercise ball will help with.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the hermit is sitting on an exercise ball, which is often used for people who want to get a tighter butt. However, in this case, the hermit is just using it as a chair, and so the explorer's comment is a play on the double meaning of "tighten your butt."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of the word "path": the explorer is asking the hermit for directions, but the hermit mistakes the explorer's question for aPick Up Artist question. The hermit is then trying to give the explorer PUA advice, telling him that the way to a woman's heart is through a tight butt.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the exercise ball is offering to help the backpacker, but the only thing he can offer help with is getting a tighter butt. This is a play on words because "tighten" can mean to physically make something tighter, like the muscles in someone's butt, but it can also mean to make something more secure, like the straps on a backpack. So, the man is offering to help the backpacker in both a literal and figurative sense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the hermit is sitting on an exercise ball, which is often used for working out and getting a tighter butt. So, the explorer is asking if the hermit knows the way out of the cave, and the hermit instead offers to show the explorer the way to a tighter butt, which is not what the explorer was looking for.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
