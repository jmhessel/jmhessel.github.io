In this case, the man and woman are arguing, and the media is covering it, but the couple is dressed in fancy clothes, which is out of proportion to the event. The joke is also funny because the couple is surrounded by burning buildings, which is a metaphor for how their relationship is falling apart.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "blow this out of proportion" is often used to describe how the media can take a small story and make it seem like a much bigger deal than it really is. In this case, the man is saying that the media will take the destruction caused by the bombs and make it seem even worse than it really is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a commentary on how the media often sensationalizes stories. In this case, the media will probably take the couple's casual sitting on a bench in the middle of a wasteland and blow it out of proportion, making it seem like they are doing something much more significant than they actually are.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the media is often blamed for "blowing things out of proportion." In this case, the media is being blamed for the situation the couple is in: they are sitting on a bench in the middle of a wasteland, which has been blown out of proportion. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words: the couple is sitting on a "bench" in the midst of the "bombing."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is saying that the media will "blow" ( meaning to explode) the situation out of proportion, while the woman is likely thinking that he is saying that the media will "blow" (meaning to inflate) the situation out of proportion. In either case, the media's reaction to the situation will be overblown.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "blowing something out of proportion" is often used to describe how the media sensationalizes stories, but in this case, the speaker is warning that the media will "blow" (i.e., literally cause a gust of wind with their coverage) the couple away because they're sitting in the middle of a wasteland. The joke relies on the contrast between the normal idiom and the unusual setting to be funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the media is often accused of having a biased view of events, and this joke playfully uses that to suggest that even a relationship as simple as a man and woman sitting on a bench could be seen as newsworthy and controversial. In this case, the media would be "blowing it out of proportion" by reporting on it as if it were a major story.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people in the foreground are completely unphased by the destruction behind them, and the joke is a comment on how the media often blows things out of proportion. In this case, the media will likely make the destruction of the city seem like a much bigger deal than it actually is to the two people in the foreground.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "the media will blow this out of proportion". In this case, the "this" refers to the apocalypse that the couple is currently living in. The fact that they are casually sitting on a bench in the middle of all the destruction shows that they are not too worried about the current situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the scene is clearly post-apocalyptic, and yet, the man and woman are sitting on a bench having a casual conversation as if nothing has happened. The media is corrupt in the sense that it will likely ignore the devastation wrought by the apocalypse, or downplay it, and instead focus on more sensationalized stories.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to the way that the media often takes stories about relationships and blows them out of proportion. In this situation, the two people are in the middle of a wasteland, and they are clearly having a bad fight. The media is known for taking stories like this and blowing them out of proportion, so the joke is that the media will take this story and make it seem much worse than it actually is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "blow this way out of proportion" is often used to describe how the media will take a small event and make it into a huge story. In this case, the word "blow" is used literally, as in the case of a nuclear explosion. The joke is clever because it's a play on words that also describes the literally disastrous setting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "blow" has two meanings: to cause an explosion, or to exaggerate something. In this case, the media is blowing the situation out of proportion, meaning they are making it seem more important than it actually is. This is a clever way to poking at the media's coverage of sensational news stories.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is sitting in the middle of a city that has been bombed, yet they are nonchalantly discussing how the media will "blow this way out of proportion." This is a play on the phrase "the media will blow this out of proportion," which is often said about less serious news stories. Here, the joke is using the phrase in a more literal way, as the city has been literally blown up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is worried about how the media will spin the story of the destruction, while the man is more worried about the actual destruction. The joke pokes fun at the media's tendency to sensationalize stories.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="70.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="72.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
