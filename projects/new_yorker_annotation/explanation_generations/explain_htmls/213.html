I think it just wants to be squeezed.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The honey bear is attacking the hikers, and the only way to stop it is to "squeeze" it, which is also a slang term for killing someone. The fact that the bear is made of honey is also ironic, because honey is something that is often seen as being calm and peaceful.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays off the stereotype that bears are dangerous animals that will attack humans. However, this bear is not actually a bear, but a jar of honey in the shape of a bear. The fact that the jar of honey is attacking the hikers suggests that it wants to be eaten, i.e., squeezed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it is true that bears like honey and might be attracted to a human if they have honey on them, the fact that this bear is shaped like a container of honey implies that it is not a real bear, but rather, a container of honey that has come to life. This makes the situation less dangerous, but still, the person's comment about the bear just wanting to be squeezed is humorous because it's an absurd thing to say about a bear, whether it's real or not.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The bear is a jar of honey, and so, when the person says "I think it just wants to be squeezed," they are actually saying that the bear wants to be eaten, as honey is often eaten by squeezing it out of a container. However, the fact that the bear is also a real bear makes the joke even funnier, because now, the person is saying that the bear wants to be eaten in a literal sense, which is obviously not what the bear wants.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it's true that bears are often attracted to people because they want food, the idea that the bear in this scene just wants to be hugged and cuddled is absurd. The contrast between the dangerous predator and the innocuous desire makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity between the dangerous situation the people are in --- being accosted by a giant bear --- and the suggestion that the bear is harmless and just wants a hug.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the jar of honey is acting like a real bear, and the person says that it just wants to be squeezed. This is a play on words because when people are attacked by animals, they are usually advised to "play dead." In this case, the person is advising the others to "play alive" by beingSqueezed by the honey bear.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the beekeeper is trying to rationalize the situation and stay calm, but the truth is that the bear-shaped honey container is probably going to hurt them. The beekeeper's comment implies that he doesn't really know what to do, but is trying to keep a level head.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common saying "stay calm, it just wants to be loved." The difference is that, instead of wanting love, the bear just wants to be squeezed (presumably so the honey will come out). The hikers' reaction is also humorous because they are more concerned with the bear than with their own safety.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is trying to remain calm in the face of an impending attack by a bear, but their assessment of the bear's motives is absurd. The bear does not want to be "squeezed" like a honey container, but wants to attack the people. The contrast between the speaker's assessment of the bear's motives and the reality of the situation is what makes this joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is acting like the honey bear is a cute, cuddly animal that just wants to be hugged, when in reality, it is a large, dangerous creature that is attacking the hikers. The contrast between the speaker's tone and the reality of the situation is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Squeezed" can mean two things: (1) to be hugged tightly or (2) to be extract juice or liquid from something. In this context, the bear wants to be "squeezed" in the second sense: it wants the people to extract honey from it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The jar of honey is in the shape of a bear, so when the bear-shaped jar of honey comes to life, the hikers think it's an actual bear. However, the jar of honey is only attacking the hikers because it wants to be squeezed (for the honey), not because it's actually a real, dangerous bear.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it puns on the words "honey" and "bear." The fact that the bear is a jar of honey is already strange and funny, but the joke takes it one step further by implying that the bear might just be trying to give the hikers a "hug" (i.e., beSqueezed). This is a play on the fact that bears are often seen as dangerous animals, even though they are often just trying to be friendly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the jar of honey is acting like a real bear, and bears are known to be aggressive animals. However, the jar of honey is not a real bear, it's just a large container of honey that happens to be in the shape of a bear. The joke is funny because the jar of honey is not actually dangerous, despite its aggressive behavior.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
