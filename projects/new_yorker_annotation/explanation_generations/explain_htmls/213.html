This is a play on words because "circumcision symposium" is a conference for medical professionals who specialize in the circumcision procedure. The joke is clever because it is both a visual play on the image of God giving Moses a blanket/sweater, and a linguistic play on the meaning of "circumcision symposium."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in this version of the story, instead of receiving the ten commandments from God, Moses is receiving a sweater. This is silly because it's getting cold on the mountain and Moses needs a sweater, but in the context of the story, it's unexpected and makes light of a famous religious story.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is holding on to his penis and testicles, which are about to be covered by the sweater brought down by the hand from the clouds. This is a reference to the Biblical story of Moses and the Ten Commandments, where God gave Moses the Ten Commandments on two stone tablets. In this version, the man is holding onto his penis and testicles, which are about to be covered by the sweater, in a similar way that Moses was holding onto the stone tablets.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is holding on to his penis and testicles, which are about to be covered by the sweater that the hand is offering. The chilly reception refers to the fact that he will beCold without them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The physical act of circumcision is often performed in cold temperatures to reduce swelling, so the joke is that the sweater Moses is receiving from God will be helpful for him when he gives a presentation on circumcision at a symposium.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "chilly reception" refers to the fact that the sweater is actually a turtleneck, which would usually be seen as an unwelcome gift because it's not very flattering. However, the joke is also referring to the fact that circumcision is often performed in cold places, so a turtleneck would actually be a welcome gift in that context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. Circumcision is a surgical procedure in which the foreskin of the penis is removed. A symposium is a conference or meeting, usually on a specific topic. So the joke is that, because Moses is wearing a modern sweater, he will be cold at the conference (because he is not used to the cold weather) and because he is wearing a sweater, people will assume he is circumcised.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the picture is worried because he sees a hand coming out of the clouds, which could be interpreted as God's hand. However, the joke is that the hand is actually coming from a cloud, which is a much more innocent and mundane occurrence. The joke is clever because it's a play on words --- "chilly reception" can mean that he will be met with coldness/dislike, or it can literally mean that the temperature will be cold. In this case, it's a pun because both meanings are appropriate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the picture is holding on to his robe, which is a symbol of his faith, and he is worried about a hand coming out of the clouds. The hand is coming out of the clouds to give him a sweater, which is a symbol of God's love. But, the joke is that the hand is going to give him a sweater because he is going to be cold at the circumcision symposium, which is a medical conference about a sensitive topic. The joke is clever because it ties together the idea of God's love and the idea of being cold in a way that is unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "chilly" can refer to both the cold weather and to feeling unfriendly or uninterested. In this case, the joke is saying that because God gave Moses a sweater, he will be unfriendly or uninterested at the circumcision symposium, which is a gathering of people discussing circumcision.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the sweater that God is giving Moses is unexpected and unlike the normative objects given in the story (commandments). The joke is making a pun on "chilly reception", meaning a cold or unwelcoming reception, and the fact that a turtleneck sweater would literally make someone's reception chilly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The original phrase is "expect a warm reception," meaning that you'll be welcomed warmly. But in this case, the reception Moses is going to attend is a circumcision symposium, which is a meeting of medical professionals who discuss circumcisions, and it's going to be chilly because he's wearing a sweater. The joke is clever because it's a double meaning of the phrase "chilly reception."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The hand of God giving Moses a jacket is a pun on the phrase "expect a chilly reception." The fact that the symposium is about circumcision makes the joke even funnier, because Moses is probably the most famous figure in Judaism, andCircumcision is a common practice in Judaism.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's worried look, and the fact that he's holding two objects close to his chest, implies that he's about to be circumcised. This is made funnier by the fact that he's on a mountain top, which is a symbol of sanctity and purity, and thus circumcision would be an even more extreme act. The fact that the hand coming down from the clouds is holding a sweater implies that the man is going to be cold after the circumcision, since he will no longer have a foreskin to protect his penis.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Moses is wearing a sweater, which is a common garment people wear to stay warm. However, the fact that Moses is wearing a sweater is particularly funny because he is about to go down from the mountain top, where it is likely cold, to deliver the Ten Commandments to the Israelites. The fact that he is wearing a sweater suggests that he is more interested in staying warm than in delivering the commandments.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="212.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="214.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
