However, in this case, the angel is making a joke about the politician angel's opponent being dead --- which, of course, would be a very serious issue in a normal election. However, since this is taking place in heaven, the joke is that the opponent angel is already dead, so it's not really a negative smear tactic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in order to get into heaven, one generally needs to die first. However, the fact that the politician is campaigning implies that he somehow got into heaven without actually dying. This joke plays on the common perception that politicians are dishonest and will do whatever it takes to win an election.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in order to be elected to office in the United States, a candidate has to be a natural born citizen. However, because the candidate is an angel, he technically could have forged his death certificate in order to appear to be a natural born citizen.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="212.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="214.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
