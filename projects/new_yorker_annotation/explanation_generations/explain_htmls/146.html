The joke is also a play on words, because the St. Francis in question is not the saint, but rather the St. Francis birdfeeder, which is designed to be covered in birds.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the person on the right is the incarnation of St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals. The contrast between the saintly figure and the reality of being covered in pigeons is what makes the joke humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "The St. Francis": in one sense, it refers to the famous statue of Saint Francis of Assisi in San Francisco ("The City by the Bay"), which is a popular place for birds to congregate. However, in this context, "The St. Francis" is also a pun for "The St. Francis Hotel", a place where people might go to get away from birds. The man being covered in birds is effectively being "attacked" by them, and the other man's reading is disrupted, so he asks if the man would like to go to the hotel to get away from the birds.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker implies that the person on the right, who is covered in pigeons, is the St. Francis of Assisi, a Catholic saint who is often depicted with animals. The joke is a play on words, as the phrase "the St. Francis" can mean either the saint himself, or the act of being covered in animals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the men is surprised that the other man is covered in birds. The man covered in birds is probably not expecting the other man to recognize him, but the fact that he does suggests that the man is famous. The man covered in birds is likely Saint Francis of Assisi, who was known for his love of nature and animals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the men is asking if the other is the legendary Saint Francis of Assisi, who was known for his ability to communicate with animals. The joke is funny because the man is literally covered in birds, which is a clear sign that he has the ability to communicate with them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the two men. One man is being attacked by a bunch of birds, which is not a good situation to be in, while the other man is calmly reading a book. This contrast is even funnier because the man being attacked is named St. Francis, who is the patron saint of animals. Thus, the joke is making fun of the irony of a man who loves animals being attacked by them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man talking to the pigeon-covered person assumes that the pigeons are there because that person is imitating the saint known for his love of animals, rather than the other way around (which would be that the pigeons have imprinted on the person).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man covered in birds is most likely Saint Francis, who was known for his love of animals. The other man is surprised to see Saint Francis because he is not usually depicted as a man covered in birds.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man being covered in birds is Saint Francis of Assisi, who is the patron saint of animals. Thus, the man's situation is not only unusual, but also has a religious meaning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "The St. Francis": in one sense, it is a reference to the Catholic saint who is the patron saint of animals; in another sense, it is a reference to the birdfeeder in San Francisco's Presidio park, which is a very popular place for birds (and birdwatchers). The man being attacked by birds is covered in birdseed, implying that he must have been at the St. Francis birdfeeder, which is why the other man is joking that he is the "patron saint of animals".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the right has been mistaken for the statue of St. Francis of Assisi, who is often associated with birds. The man is covered in pigeons, and so he looks like a statue of St. Francis. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the man is not actually the saint, but he is "the St. Francis" because he looks like the statue.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The person on the right is covered in pigeons, which is usually considered to be a dirty and undesirable thing. However, the man on the left refers to the person on the right as "THE St. Francis", which is a reference to Saint Francis of Assisi, who was known for his love of animals, including birds. Thus, the joke is funny because it is a play on the contrast between the two different meanings of "covered in birds".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man being attacked by birds is presumably being attacked because he smells like food. The other man, upon seeing the scene, exclaims "The St. Francis?", referring to the Catholic saint known for his love of animals, particularly birds. The joke is clever because it is a play on words --- the man on the bench is not a saint, but he is being treated as if he is one by the birds.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the right is covered in pigeons, and is thus resembling the statue of Saint Francis of Assisi, who is the patron saint of animals. The man on the left is surprised, not because there is a man covered in pigeons, but because he looks exactly like a famous statue.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="145.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="147.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
