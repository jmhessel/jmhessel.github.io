This makes the cowboy's statement that he's gone "hayless" false, because he doesn't need hay for his horse.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cowboy is out of hay for his horse. This is a play on words because "hay" is both a type of food for horses and a word meaning "crazy". The cowboy is saying that he is out of food for his horse, but also that he is "crazy".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the phrase "hairless." In this case, the cowboy's horse has no hair, because it is not a real horse, but a machine. The pun makes the joke more clever and funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man says he's "gone hayless" when he really means he's "gone wireless". In other words, he doesn't have hay (which horses eat) because he doesn't have a real horse - he has a mechanical one. The joke is a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "gone hopeless." The cowboy has swapped his horse for a mechanical one, and now he's hopeless because he's lost his horse.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cowboy on the mechanical horse has literally gone without hay, which is the food horses eat. This is a play on words because "hayless" can also mean " feeble-minded."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cowboy on the real horse is pointing out how strange it is that the other cowboy's horse is a machine. Cowboys typically use hay to feed their horses, so the fact that the cowboy's horse doesn't need hay implies that it's not a real horse.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the mechanical horse doesn't need hay to eat, unlike a real horse. The cowboy riding the mechanical horse is saying that he's gone hayless, meaning he doesn't need hay, which is a type of food horses eat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cowboy on the mechanical horse is saying that he's run out of hay. This is a play on words because "hay" is both a type of food for horses and a word meaning "crazy." In this case, the cowboy is saying that he's run out of food for his horse, but also that he's gone crazy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the fact that the horse is mechanical (i.e., it doesn't need hay to eat) and the fact that the cowboy has gone "haywire" (i.e., he's lost his mind).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cowboy is saying that he's run out of hay for his horse to eat. However, the other cowboy's horse is mechanical, so it doesn't need to eat hay. The first cowboy is emphasizing his lack of resources by pointing out that even the other cowboy's horse doesn't need hay.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Hay" is a type of food that horses eat, and "haywire" is when something goes wrong with an electronic device. So, the cowboy is saying that his horse has gone wrong --- it's a mechanical horse, so it's not supposed to be alive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The cowboy has gone "haywire", meaning he's gone crazy, but "hay" is also food that horses eat. So, the cowboy has gone crazy and his horse is hungry.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cowboy on the mechanical horse has no need for hay, which is a food for horses. This cowboy is either very lazy or very technologically advanced,Neither of which is common for a cowboy. The joke could also be interpreted to mean that the cowboy is so horse-like that he doesn't even need to eat hay.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The cowboy has gone "hayless" meaning he has no hay for his horse, but it also sounds like "healess" which would mean he is injured and can't heal. This is a clever way to make a joke about a mechanical horse in the old west.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="145.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="147.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
