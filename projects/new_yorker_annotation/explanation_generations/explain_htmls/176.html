The cone is supposed to prevent the dog from scratching its head, but because it's worn backwards, it's not serving that purpose. The joke is that the dog is wearing its cone "backwards," which means that it's not following the current trend or style.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the difference in how the two dogs are wearing their cones. One dog is wearing it the "normal" way, with the cone pointing outwards to prevent him from scratching himself. The other dog has the cone on backwards, so it's not actually doing anything. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the "normal" way to wear a cone is the "new" way, while the "old" way is the ineffective way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the dogs is wearing a cone and the other dog says that no one wears their cone that way anymore, making a joke about how the fashion has changed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "wearing a cone" can refer to two different things: first, it can refer to the literal act of wearing a cone-shaped object on one's head; second, it can refer to being under the influence of drugs, specifically marijuana (i.e., being "stoned"). The dog who is wearing the cone backwards is thus interpreted as being high, which is why he seems happy. The other dog, who is wearing the cone properly, is confused because he doesn't understand why his friend is happy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in this scene, one of the dogs is wearing a cone in an outdated way. Wearing a cone like that would be analogous to a human wearing their pants backwards: it's possible to do, but it's not the way that it's supposed to be done, and it would be noticeable. The other dog points out this fact to the first dog, who is presumably its father. The fact that the father dog doesn't know that cones are worn differently now implies that he is out of touch with current trends.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the dogs is wearing its cone backwards, which would normally be something a silly/ ignorant person would do. The other dog says that no one wears their cone like that anymore, indicating that the backward cone-wearer is behind the times.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog wearing the cone backwards is not following the current trend. The other dog says that no one wears their cone like that anymore, implying that there is a correct way to wear a cone, and that the dog is not following the trend.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog who is wearing the cone the proper way is telling the other dog, presumably his father, that he is embarrassed by him and that he is not wearing the cone the way that everyone else does. The joke is a play on the fact that children are often embarrassed by their parents when they don't dress or act the way that is considered normal by their peers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. Wearing a cone "like that" could mean two different things: either wearing the cone backwards, or wearing the cone in an outdated way. In this case, the dog on the left is laughing at the dog on the right for both reasons: the cone is backwards, and the cone is an outdated fashion.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Elizabethan collar, also known as the "cone of shame" is meant to keep dogs from biting or licking their stitches after getting surgery. However, the cone is supposed to go around the neck, not the head. So, the dog on the left is making fun of the dog on the right for wearing the cone backwards.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the proper way to wear a cone is around the neck, the dog's cone is backwards, and the other dog points this out. Wearing a cone is often seen as a sign of embarrassment or shame, because it suggests that the dog has done something (likely getting into something they're not supposed to, like trash) and needs to wear the cone to prevent them from doing it again. The fact that the cone is backwards makes it even more comical.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The "cone" the dog is wearing is an Elizabethan collar, which is a type of cone-shaped collar that is worn to prevent animals from scratching themselves. The joke is that the dog is wearing the cone around its neck backwards, which would not prevent it from scratching, i.e., it's not effective. But, the joke could also be interpreted to mean that the cone is old-fashioned and no one wears them like that anymore, which would be why the dog's dad is not wearing one.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog with the cone on backwards is likely older, and thus the other dog is making a joke about how old-fashioned he is. This is a play on the idea that people who are "out of touch" with current trends are often older.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog wearing the cone backwards is outdated and not following the current trends. The other dog is saying that no one wears their cone like that anymore, implying that it is no longer fashionable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The dog on the right is wearing their cone "like that" meaning backwards, and the dog on the left is implying that this is no longer fashionable. This is a silly joke because cones are practical items meant to keep dogs from licking their wounds, and so fashionability is not really a concern.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="175.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="177.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
