The joke is also funny because it's a play on words -- the man is literally climbing a mountain, but he's also "virtually" there, meaning he's close to the top.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is continuing to climb even though he's nearly at the top and he's technically not even climbing a real mountain. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words - the man is virtually at the top, meaning he's close to the top, but virtually also means that he's not actually at the top.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, despite the man's protests, he is not actually making any progress in his "climb" and is in fact just standing in place. The joke is a play on the word "virtually", which can mean either "nearly, but not quite" or "in essence, though not in actual fact". In this case, the man is virtually (in essence, though not in actual fact) there, but he is not actually there.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it puns on the word "virtually." Virtual can mean "not physically existing as such but made by software to appear to do so" --- in other words, the man is climbing an invisible wall. But "virtual" can also mean "nearly or practically," so the man is also saying that he's nearly at the top of the wall (i.e., he's "virtually there").</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is midair, doing something impossible, yet he is soclose to the top of the "mountain" that he can't stop now. The man's usage of the word "virtually" is also humorous because it's a way of saying "almost" but in this case, it's literally true: he is almost to the top of the virtual mountain.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is scaling an invisible mountain, so he's not actually accomplishing anything. However, he's so close to the top that he can't stop now, even though there's nothing to stop him from falling. The joke is a play on the phrase "I'm almost there" which is often used to encourage someone to keep going even when they are tired.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is doing something that is impossible: climbing onto nothing. The fact that he is "virtually there" implies that he is close to finishing, but because he is climbing onto nothing, he will never actually reach the top.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man climbing is doing so without any support, meaning that he will eventually fall. The joke is also funny because "virtually" can mean "almost" or "close to", but in this case it means "in a virtual reality". The man is close to the top of the virtual reality wall, but in the real world he's just climbing thin air.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is climbing is pretending that he is about to reach the top of the wall, even though there is no wall. The joke is a play on words, because "virtually" can mean "almost" but it also can mean "in essence, even though not actually physically present." So the man is saying that he is "almost there" but also that he is "not actually there."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man climbing is invisible, and so he is technically climbing "nothing." The man watching him is unimpressed, because to the onlooker, it just looks like the climber is flailing around in the air.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man climbing the mountain is so close to the summit that he can't turn back, even though the mountain is invisible and therefore, doesn't exist. The joke is clever because it play off the fact that the man is virtually at the summit, meaning he is close, but also because virtual can mean fake or not real. So the joke is cleverly making a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man climbing is depending on an invisible wall to keep him from falling, and he is very close to the top. The man below him is encouraging him to keep going, even though there is nothing there to catch him if he falls. The joke is clever because "virtually" can mean either "almost" or "in a sense that is not physical or concrete".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is climbing an invisible wall, and thus he's "virtually" there, meaning he's close to finishing. The joke also play on the double meaning of "virtually", meaning both "almost" and "in a virtual reality".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is "virtually there" because he is invisible, and thus, not really present. This is a clever way of saying that he is not really making any progress, because he is not really there.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is scaling an invisible mountain, which is a feat that is physically impossible. The man is also using a pun, as he is virtually at the top of the mountain (meaning he is close to the top) but also he is only virtually there, as in he is not actually there at all.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="175.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="177.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
