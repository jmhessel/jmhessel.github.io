The word "life preserver" can mean either a literal preserver of life (like a floatation device) or figuratively, something that someone does to save another person's life (like performing CPR). In this context, the man is making a floatation device for the woman's mother, which is a literal life preserver. However, the fact that he is staring at the wheel suggests that he is also deep in thought about how to save the woman's mother's life in a figurative sense, making the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The stone wheel the man is working on looks like it would be too big to use as a life preserver, but the woman says he is making it for her mother, not for herself. So, it's a play on the phrase "a life preserver" --- something that would actually help someone in a dangerous situation --- and the much less useful stone wheel.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the scene is chiseling a stone wheel, which could be used as a life preserver, but the woman says he is making a life preserver "for my Mother." In this case, the life preserver is figurative, not literal --- it's a slang term meaning someone who is supportive and helpful, especially in difficult times.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The giant donut can be interpreted as a life preserver, which would be used to keep someone safe if they were in danger of drowning. However, the man is actually intending to eat the donut, not use it as a life preserver. The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "a life saver."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because why would someone need a life preserver in their living room? The joke suggests that the man is chiseling a stone wheel to be used as a life preserver, which is an absurd idea. The joke is also clever because it's a play on words: a "life preserver" is usually made of wood or cork, not stone, so it's a pun on the word "preserver."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is making a life preserver, which is a round, donut-shaped floatation device, out of a large stone wheel. The joke is a play on words because the life preserver is for the woman's mother, not for the stone wheel.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is considering a large donut, which is traditionally shaped like a life preserver. The comment implies that the man's mother is obese, and he is making a life preserver for her in case she falls into water and needs it to float. The joke is clever because it plays on the double meaning of the word "preserver."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is an unlikely story. It is much more likely that someone would be making a life preserver for a baby or child, since they are more likely to need one and they are less able to swim. The fact that the man is making a life preserver for an adult woman is funny because it's not something that would usually be necessary.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is carving a life preserver, which is usually a round, inflatable ring meant to help someone stay afloat, out of a huge wheel. The wheel is much too big to be a life preserver, and would actually be more harmful than helpful if someone were to try to use it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the wheel is an unexpected object to find in a living room, and the man's actions don't make sense in light of it. The joke is that the man is making a life preserver, which is a circular object, out of the wheel, which is also a circular object. The joke is a play on the fact that the two objects are similar in shape, but have different functions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because donuts are often circular, like life preservers, and because the man is making a donut that is so big, it could actually be used as a life preserver. The joke is clever because it plays on the two different meanings of the word "life."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the carving of the wheel is so out of place that it must have some sort of specific purpose. The man is presumably carving it because his mother is a sailor, and he wants to make her a life preserver. This is a specific enough use for the wheel that it makes sense, despite the fact that it's an unusual thing to find in a living room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the wheel doesn't have any obvious purpose, so the man must be making it into something. The life preserver is a functional item, albeit one that wouldn't ordinarily be made out of a wheel, so the joke is that the man is putting the wheel to a use that is more practical than decorative.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Making a life preserver" can mean two things: first, it can mean physically creating a flotation device out of materials at hand, which is why the man is staring at the wheel. But, it can also mean "saving someone's life", which is why the women are talking in the other room: the man is likely their husband/son, and they are discussing how he is trying to save his mother's life.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "life-sized sculpture" --- the man in the other room is making a sculpture that is literally the size of a life preserver, and it's for the woman's mother. The woman's mother is presumably elderly, and so the life preserver is likely for her safety in case she falls in water.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="235.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="237.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
