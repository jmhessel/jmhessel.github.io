When you see your reflection in the mirror, it's a reflection of yourself, so the fact that the man's reflection is of Abraham Lincoln is unexpected. Furthermore, the man's tired appearance and the fact that it's morning suggests that he doesn't want to go see a play, which is also a play on the word "reflection."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's tiredness is juxtaposed with the energy and excitement that would be expected from seeing a play starring Abraham Lincoln. However, the fact that the man's tiredness is due to seeing his own reflection in the mirror, which is that of Abraham Lincoln, makes it clear that he is not actually seeing the president, but is instead seeing a tired version of himself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's reflection is of Abraham Lincoln, who was famously assassinated while attending a play at Ford's Theater. The man's comment, that they should "skip the play", is a pun on the fact that Lincoln was assassinated: by "skipping" the play, they would avoid going to Ford's Theater and thus, the man would not be assassinated.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="235.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="237.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
