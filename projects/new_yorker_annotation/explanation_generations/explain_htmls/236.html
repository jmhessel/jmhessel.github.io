A "bouncer" is someone who throws people out of a bar, and a "ballerina" is a type of dancer. So, the man in the trenchcoat is telling the bartender that the dancer is a great bouncer because she is very good at throwing people out of the bar.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the usual understanding of a bouncer is a large, burly man who throws people out of bars who are causing trouble. In this instance, the bouncer is a ballerina, who is not at all who you would expect to be fulfilling that role. The fact that the man in the trenchcoat is hiring her adds to the humor because it implies that he is in the business of hiring bouncers, and he thinks she's the best he's ever seen, even though she doesn't fit the stereotype.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "bouncer" can refer to two different things: (1) a person who tosses people out of a bar for causing trouble and (2) a type of move in ballet. In this case, the man in the trenchcoat is telling the bartender that the dancer is a great "bouncer" (i.e., she's good at tossing people out), but the dancer is actually a ballerina.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the ballerina dancer looks very out of place in the bar, and the man in the trenchcoat is talking to the bartender about how great of a bouncer she is. Bouncers are usually large and muscular men, so the idea of a small and delicate-looking ballerina being a bouncer is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: a "bouncer" is someone who throws out people who are not welcome at a bar, and a "ballerina" is a type of dancer. So, the man in the trenchcoat is telling the bartender that the dancer is doing a good job of throwing out people who are not welcome. This is funny because it's unexpected and because it's a pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the ballerina is not what one would expect to find working as a bouncer at a bar. Bouncers are usually big, burly men, not delicate women in tutus. The joke suggests that the ballerina is so good at her job, keeping unwanted people out of the bar, that she's become the best bouncer that the man has ever hired.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is play on words. In this case, the word "bouncer" can refer to two different things: (1) someone who throws people out of a bar and (2) someone who dances on stage (a "belly dancer," for example). The fact that the ballerina dancer is behind the man in the trenchcoat suggests that she is a bouncer (of the first kind), but the fact that she is a ballerina dancer suggests that she is a bouncer (of the second kind).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the trenchcoat is telling the bartender that the dancer behind him is actually a very good bouncer. The reason this is funny is because bouncers are usually big, burly men, and dancers are usually small and delicately-built women. So, the fact that the dancer is actually a very good bouncer is unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it conflates two very different professions: ballerinas and bouncers. Ballerinas are generally elegant and graceful, while bouncers are big and burly and known for being tough. The idea of a ballerina being a bouncer is incongruous, and thus funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the definition of "bouncer" is being stretched in this context. A bouncer is usually a large, burly man who throws out people who are causing trouble in a bar. However, in this case, the ballerina is the bouncer, which is funny because she is the opposite of what one typically imagines when they think of a bouncer.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the contrast between a dainty ballerina and a big, burly bouncer is incongruous. The idea that the ballerina is so good at her job that she is actually better than a traditional bouncer is even more amusing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. A "bouncer" is someone who is hired to remove people who are not welcome in a bar, and a "ballerina" is a type of dancer. In this context, the word "bouncer" is used to mean "dancer" because the ballerina is not welcome in the bar. The man in the trenchcoat is telling the bartender that she is a good dancer, and the bartender is probably thinking that she is a good bouncer.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "bouncer" is someone who throws people out of a bar or club, but a "ballerina" is a type of dancer. So in this context, the ballerina is acting as a bouncer, throwing people out of the bar with her dancing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the trenchcoat is not actually talking about the ballerina dancer, he's talking about the bartender. The word "bouncer" can refer to someone who throws people out of a bar (which is what the bartender is doing to the dancer), or it can refer to someone who is hired to dance at a club (which is what the ballerina is). So, the man in the trenchcoat is telling the bartender that he's doing a good job, but he's using the wrong word, which is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the woman who is actually a ballerina dancer is working as a bouncer at the bar, even though she is not dressed or built like a bouncer. The joke is even funnier because, in addition to being a ballerina, the woman is also very short. So not only is she not dressed or built like a bouncer, she is also not tall enough to be an effective bouncer.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
