The scientist is saying that the more important thing he learned from the experiment is not what he learned about the rats, but what he learned about himself. This is a way of saying that the experiment was a personal failure, but he learned something from it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a self-deprecating joke about how the person in the rat costume probably got made fun of by the other scientist. He's trying to act like he's above it and has learned something valuable from the experience, but the joke is that he's actually just embarrassed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the scientist in the rat costume is saying that he learned something more important than the scientific research they were conducting. This is funny because it's a play on words: the word "rat" can mean both a rodent that is often used in scientific experiments, and a person who betrays others or is otherwise disloyal. Therefore, the scientist in the rat costume is saying that he learned he is a betrayer, which is more important than the research they were conducting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the rat costume is probably a janitor or some other low-level worker in the lab. However, the way he talks suggests that he sees himself as above his station: he is deep in thought, and he speaks as if he has gained some great insight from his work with the mice. The joke is a play on the idea that even the most humble of jobs can teach us something about ourselves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it subverts the expectations of what a scientist would learn from testing on rats. In this case, the joke is that the scientist learned more about themselves from the process, which is unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The scientist in the rat costume says that he has learned something important, but what he really means is that he has learned something about rats, not about himself. This is a play on words because the word "rat" can mean both the actual animal, and a person who is considered to be unpleasant or sneaky. So, the joke is funny because the scientist isboth talking about himself and the rats in the cage.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is unexpected. The mouse-costumed scientist has just finished telling a story about something that happened to him while he was in the rat costume, and his colleague responds with a very serious statement. This is unexpected because it is a completely non-sequitur response to the story, and it is also unexpected because it shows that the colleague takes the mouse-costumed scientist seriously, despite his ridiculous outfit.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected that the scientist would be wearing a rat costume. The costume is likely very hot and uncomfortable, which would make it difficult to concentrate on the research. Additionally, the fact that he's wearing a rat costume in a room full of actual rats is a bit ironic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rat-dressed scientist is talking about his latest experiment, which was presumably done on the mice in the cage. The fact that he's wearing a rat costume implies that he conducted the experiment on himself, which is humorous because it's usually not ethical to experiment on oneself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a self-deprecating humor. The man in the rat costume is probably a janitor or lab assistant, and is making a joke about how his job is not as important as the scientist's job. However, the joke is also clever because it's true: the man in the rat costume has probably learned a lot about himself from his job, such as patience, diligence, and attention to detail.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "what I learned about myself" can mean either that the person has gathered more information to know about themselves, or that they have come to a greater understanding or realization about themselves. However, in this context, the scientist has literally just found out that he is a laboratory rat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the rat costume is saying that he has learned something important, but what he actually means is that he has learned something important about rats. This is a play on words because the word "rat" can refer to both the animal and a person who is considered untrustworthy or disliked.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The scientist is talking about a study he did where he dressed up as a rat, and how he learned about the behavior of rats. But, at the same time, he's also saying that he learned about himself from the study. This is clever because it's true --- he did learn about himself from the study, but he also now knows how rats behave, which is likely more important information than anything he learned about himself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the scientist's self-reflection is out of place given the context of the situation. Wearing a rat costume in a lab full of mice is strange enough, but the fact that he's reflecting on what he's learned about himself suggests that he's made some sort of realization that goes beyond just the superficial level of wearing a rat costume. This joke plays with the idea that people in fursuits are often people who are comfortable with their own identity and are able to see beyond the surface level.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the scientist dressed as a rat is saying that, even though the experiment was about the rats, he/she learned more about themselves. This is humorous because it's a reversal of the expected roles: usually, scientists learn about the rats they are testing, not the other way around. Furthermore, it's unlikely that the scientist would learn anything significant about themselves from an experiment involving rats.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="122.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="124.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
