This is a pun on the phrase "to kill time," which means to do something to pass the time. In this case, the woman is offering Satan a drink so that he can "kill time" before he has to go and do his job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "to kill" can mean to murder someone, or to spend time doing something. In this context, the phrase means the latter, but Satan's presence suggests the former. This joke is clever because it's a pun that also manages to be a play on a common saying.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The lady is offering a drink to Satan, and Satan says that he has a few minutes to kill, which could mean that he has time to drink the beer or that he plans to kill the lady. The ambiguity is funny because it's not clear which meaning Satan intends.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the grim reaper is personification of death, so the man's statement that the grim reaper has a few minutes to kill is pun on the fact that the grim reaper is going to kill the man.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In the context of the scene, "to kill" means to murder, or cause the death of someone. However, in this case, the man is offering a beer to Death, who is actually a personification of death itself. So the man is actually offering a beer to death, which is a ironic because death is usually associated with endings, not beginnings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lady is offering a beer to Satan, the personification of death. Of course, Satan doesn't need to drink alcohol to get intoxicated, because he's already dead. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: "to kill" can mean both to murder someone and to consume alcohol. In this case, the lady is offering Satan a beer so that he can (figuratively) kill time while he's waiting for his next victim.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman offering Satan a beer is technically offering him a way to kill time, since beer often makes people drowsy and less productive. However, "kill" also has the more literal meaning of to end someone's life, which is what Satan does. Therefore, the woman's offer is amusingly ironic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lady is offering Satan a beer, even though Satan is the personification of death. So the joke is playing on the idea that death is inevitable, and even taking a break to have a beer won't make a difference. The lady is in a good mood because she's enjoying her beer, despite the fact that Satan is there.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "I've got a few minutes to kill" is often used to mean that someone has some time to kill, or some time to spare. However, in this context, the phrase takes on a more literal meaning, since the Grim Reaper is the personification of death. So, when the man at the bar offers him a beer, the Grim Reaper says that he has a few minutes to kill, meaning that he literally has a few minutes before he needs to go and claim another soul.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "a few minutes to kill" can mean either that the person has a few minutes to spare, or that the person needs to kill someone. In this case, the man is offering to buy a beer for Death, who is personified as a man in a hooded robe. The fact that the man is casually offering to buy a beer for Death is ironic, given that Death is usually seen as a Grim Reaper who comes to claim people's lives.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Satan, as the personification of death, doesn't have time to kill. The lady offering him a beer is in a happy mood, even though Satan is there, which is also strange. The joke is clever because it playfully subverts our expectations: we expect Satan to be busy killing people, and we expect the lady to be scared or surprised to see Satan.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it puns on the phrase "I've got a few minutes to kill." Usually, this phrase means that someone has some free time and they are looking for something to do. In this case, the lady is offering Satan a drink, and he says he has a few minutes to kill, meaning that he is going to kill her. The joke is clever because it is a reversal of the usual phrase.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "to kill" can mean to murder someone, or to spend time doing something. In this context, the man is offering to spend time with Death, even though "to kill" is usually associated with Death. The joke is clever because it is both a pun and a reflection on the fact that death is inevitable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The grim reaper is death personified, so when the man offers him a beer, the grim reaper says that he's got a few minutes to kill. In other words, the grim reaper is saying that he's got time to kill because that's his job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is offering a drink to Satan, who is personification of death. So, the woman is effectively offering a drink to death, which is a way of killing time. The irony is that, by taking a drink from the woman, Satan would be killing time, rather than the other way around.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="122.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="124.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
