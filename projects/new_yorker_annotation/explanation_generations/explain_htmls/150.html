The joke is that the man is so focused on the lapel pin he was expecting to receive (for registering for something) that he is ignoring the elephant, which is a much more important matter.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually when someone says they "registered," they are talking about registering for something like an event or a class. In contrast, the person in the room is registered to have an elephant in the room, which is why there is an elephant in the room. The person is surprised that they didn't just get a lapel pin to signify their registration, which is ironic because usually, getting a lapel pin would be less significant than having an elephant in the room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person is making a small talk comment about how they didn't expect the company they registered for to do something so big and significant. The fact that there is an elephant in the room goes unnoticed by the person, perhaps because they are used to ignoring the big, significant problems in their life.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "the elephant in the room" is often used to describe a situation where there is an obvious problem that no one wants to talk about. In this case, the joke is that the couple didn't realize that, when they registered the elephant as a member of the family, they would actually have to have the elephant in their living room. The woman is surprised that they didn't just get a lapel pin or some other small token to indicate that they are registered, not the actual elephant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non sequitur. The person speaking is completely ignoring the elephant in the room, which is a very strange thing to do, and instead, is commenting on something else entirely. This joke would only be funny if the elephant in the room was a metaphor for something else, such as an awkward topic of conversation that is being ignored.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's response to his wife's conversation points towards a complete lack of understanding or acknowledgement of the elephant in the room: the fact that there is a huge elephant taking up space in their living room. His sentence could be interpreted two ways: either he thought the registration fee for the campaign he signed up for would simply get him a small token like a lapel pin, or he thought that the company would just acknowledge his registration without sending him anything. In either case, he is completely ignoring the elephant in the room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "elephant in the room." The phrase is often used to describe an issue that is evident but not being talked about, which is symbolized by an elephant in the room. In this case, the issue is that the person thought they would receive a lapel pin, but instead got an elephant. The joke is funny because it's a unexpected and absurd solution to the problem.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the phrase "the elephant in the room" is often used to describe a situation where there is an obvious problem that everyone is choosing to ignore. In this joke, the elephant is an actual elephant, and the man is surprised that the organization he registered with to help with conservation efforts has gone so far as to send him an elephant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the banal conversation the two people are having, and the fact that there is a massive elephant in the room with them. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the common idiom, "there's an elephant in the room," which is often used to describe a situation where there is an obvious problem that everyone is ignoring.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person is saying they were expecting a lapel pin, which is a small and inexpensive item, instead of the much larger and more expensive animal. They are making light of the fact that they are ignoring the large elephant in the room, which is an expensive and inconvenient reality.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The elephant in the room is a metaphor for something that's being avoided, and the joke is that the person thought they would just get a small lapel pin when they registered for the event, instead of the large elephant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a very dry, matter-of-fact way to deal with the extremely unusual situation of an elephant in the room. Most people would be much more flustered or would make more of an effort to avoid the elephant, but this man is just content to keep reading his paper as if the elephant isn't even there.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person is making a joke about the elephant in the room, which is the fact that they registered as a member of the Republican party. The elephant in the room is that the person is now a member of a political party which is often associated with large animals like elephants.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to the idiom "the elephant in the room," which refers to a big issue that everyone is aware of but no one wants to talk about. In this case, the big issue is that there is an elephant in the room, which is a very strange and surreal situation. The man's comment about a lapel pin is thus a way of downplaying the severity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the elephant in the room is a metaphor for an issue that is so large and obvious that it cannot be ignored, but people often try to avoid talking about it. In this case, the issue is that the man expected to get a lapel pin when he registered, but instead he got an elephant. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: a "lapel pin" is a small item that is often given out as a token or souvenir, while an "elephant" is a large animal.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="149.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="151.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
