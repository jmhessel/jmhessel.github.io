The joke is a play on words because the word "blend" can mean both to mix in (as one would with a crowd), or to hide in plain sight by becoming less noticeable. In this case, the king is trying to blend in (the first meaning) but is being thwarted by the photographer, who is trying to blend the king into the background (the second meaning).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man wearing the crown is not blending in, as he is very clearly standing out. The woman is telling him this, implying that she is exasperated with him for not being more aware of his surroundings and for not understanding the concept of blending in.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "blend" can mean to mix together or to be inconspicuous. In this case, the woman is telling the man that he is not being inconspicuous because he is wearing a crown and a cape, which are both very noticeable. The man, who is presumably Harry, is not blending in because he is wearing clothes that make him stand out.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man dressed as a king is named Harry, which is also a common English name. So, the joke is that he is dressed as a king, but he is trying to blend in with the commoners, which is difficult to do when you're wearing a crown and ermine cape.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the fact that, when royalty tries to blend in with normal people in public, they often stand out more because of their clothing and mannerisms. In this case, the king is wearing his crown and carrying his scepter, which makes him very noticeable. The woman accompanying him is telling him that he's not blending in very well.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man wearing the crown is not blending in. He is standing out because he is wearing a crown, which is associated with being a king. The woman is telling him that the whole point of leaving England was to blend in, but he is not doing that.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The crown is a symbol of royalty, and the joke is that the man wearing it is not blending in because he stands out due to his status. However, the woman he is with is not royalty, and is thus able to blend in, making the man's decision to wear a crown seem foolish.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The guy wearing the crown is named Harry, which is short for Henry. Henry VIII was a famous king of England who caused a lot of drama by breaking away from the Catholic Church. The fact that this guy is named Harry and is wearing a crown in a city is a play on the fact that he is causing drama by standing out and not blending in.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman, who is presumably the king's wife, is scolding him for not being more low-key and for standing out. In other words, she wants him to blend in with the common people, but he is still behaving like a king. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words; the word "blend" can mean both to mix together or to camouflage.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that, while a crown is often a symbol of royalty, in this case, the crown is so gaudy and out-of-place that it functions more like a neon sign that screams "I am a tourist!" The joke is also funny because it is a play on the fact that, while England is most often associated with royalty and archaic traditions, in reality, it is a very modern and cosmopolitan country; thus, the idea of a tourist from England trying to blend in is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman walking with the king is telling him that he's not blending in, which is the opposite of what he's supposed to be doing. The woman is presumably his wife, and she's telling him that he stands out too much because he's dressed as a king.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "blend" can mean to mix in with your surroundings, but it can also mean to drink something. In this case, the man who is dressed as a king is clearly not blending in, because he's wearing a crown and is carrying a scepter. The joke is that the woman with him is telling him that he needs to drink something, probably alcohol, in order to help him relax and fit in better.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is wearing a very conspicuous outfit (a yellow crown and red cape), which is the opposite of what one would do to try to blend in. The woman reprimanding him is likely his wife, who is exasperated by his inability to understand something so simple.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The person wearing the crown is named Harry, which is a common name in England. The joke is that, while he is not trying to stand out by wearing a crown, he is doing the exact opposite by wearing such a distinctive piece of clothing. The fact that he is in a different country is also ironic, since he is supposedly trying to "blend in" by leaving England, but is instead wearing clothing that would make him stand out anywhere.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's true: if you're trying to blend in somewhere, wearing a crown and a cape is probably not the best way to do it. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the man's name is Harry, as in Prince Harry, which makes the joke even more clever.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="149.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="151.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
