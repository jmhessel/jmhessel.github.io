In this setting, it would be blasphemous to order an alcoholic drink in a church, since drinking is discouraged in most organized religions. The joke implies that the bartenders in this church are used to serving drinks that are sinful, so a Bloody Mary wouldn't phases them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a Bloody Mary is a mixed drink that contains vodka and tomato juice, which makes it red in color. In contrast, a traditional Bloody Mary would be made with red wine, which would make it more appropriate for drinking in a church.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "Bloody Mary" is a mixed drink that contains vodka and tomato juice. In this context, the joke is warning the people not to order the drink, because it would be blasphemous to have alcohol in a church.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because ordering a "Bloody Mary" would be sacrilegious in a church; a Bloody Mary is traditionally made with vodka, which is considered alcoholic, and thus, inappropriate for a church setting. Moreover, the fact that the church is also a bar suggests that drinking alcohol is more commonplace here than in a traditional church, making the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a Bloody Mary is a cocktail traditionally made with vodka, tomato juice, and Worcestershire sauce, among other things. In this scenario, it would be inappropriate to order a cocktail containing alcohol in a church, which is why it's funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of the word "bloody": in this context, "bloody" can refer to the Virgin Mary, who is often associated with churches, or it can refer to the Bloody Mary cocktail, which is made with vodka and tomato juice. If someone ordered a Bloody Mary cocktail in a church bar, it would be seen as blasphemous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a Bloody Mary is a cocktail made with vodka and tomato juice, and is traditionally served in a tall glass. In this context, the man is saying not to order the cocktail because it would be disrespectful to have an alcoholic drink in a church.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The speaker is telling the person to not order a "Bloody Mary" drink, which is a cocktail containing vodka and tomato juice, because it would be inappropriate to order an alcoholic drink in a church. However, the word "bloody" can also be used as an intensifier, as in "That's a bloody good idea!" In this case, the speaker is saying that it's a good idea to not order a Bloody Mary drink in church because it would be inappropriate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "Bloody Mary" is both a type of alcoholic cocktail containing tomato juice, and it is also a reference to the Catholic concept of the "Blood of Christ." In the context of a bar in a church, it would be seen as inappropriate to order a drink named after the Blood of Christ.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while a Bloody Mary is a popular drink to order at a bar, it would be considered inappropriate to order one in a church, since it contains alcohol. In this context, the joke is funny because it is a play on words: the person ordering the drink would be asking for a "bloody" Mary, which is a reference to the Virgin Mary, who is typically associated with churches.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. A "Bloody Mary" is both a cocktail made with vodka, tomato juice, and other spices, and also a popular nickname for the Virgin Mary. In this context, the joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "just don't stain the altar", which would be said in a church setting. The altar is a holy object, and so it would be inappropriate to spill a drink on it. However, in this context, the altar is also a bar, so the joke is that it would be inappropriate to order a Bloody Mary cocktail at a church bar.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a normal bar, ordering a Bloody Mary would be unremarkable. But in a church, it would be considered sacrilegious to order an alcoholic drink that is named after a religious figure. The joke is a play on words, using the double meaning of "bloody" (as in "blood-red" and "containing blood") to make the joke more clever.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a Bloody Mary is a mixed drink containing vodka and tomato juice, and is thus an alcoholic beverage. In most churches, alcohol is not allowed, so it would be inappropriate to order a Bloody Mary in this church-bar.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a Bloody Mary is a drink containing alcohol, and thus would not be appropriate to order in a church. The fact that the church is also a bar makes it even more likely that someone would order a Bloody Mary, and the joke is thus a play on the expectations of what one would find in a church.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. A "bloody mary" is both a type of alcoholic drink, and a traditional prayer said in church. Here, because the church is also a bar, it would be possible to order a bloody mary drink, which would be inappropriate in a church setting.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="153.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="155.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
