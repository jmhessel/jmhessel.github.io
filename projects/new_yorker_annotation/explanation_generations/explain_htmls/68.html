"I'm only in it for the bread" means that they are only motivated by the food they will get, not by any higher goals or intellectual pursuits. This is funny because it's a contrast to the stereotype of scientists being in it for the love of knowledge.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the saying "I'm only in it for the money." The ducks in this scene are working on laptops, which typically requires bread (a food that ducks eat) to fuel them. So, in this case, the ducks are literally in it for the bread.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the word "duck": a "duck" can refer to a bird, but it can also refer to a bad investment. In this context, the ducks on the computers are a bad investment, and the scientists are only in it (studying them) for the money (bread).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In this context, "bread" is a metaphor for money. However, the fact that there are ducks in the lecture hall instead of people changes the meaning of "bread": in this context, "bread" refers to the actual food that ducks eat. So, the joke is funny because the scientist is saying that he's only in his field of study for the food, which is a less than noble reason.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: "bread" can mean money, so the bird is saying that the only reason it's attending the lecture is to get paid. But "bread" can also mean food, so the bird is also saying that it's only there for the free food that's being provided. The joke is clever because it works on two levels.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at the educational system, in particular the research grant application process. The joke is that the bird researchers are only in it for the money (the "bread"), not because they are actually interested in the research. This is a common critique of academia: that many researchers are only in it for the money, not for the sake of knowledge.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "I'm only in it for the money." The situation is already strange because ducks are on computers, which is not something that ducks normally do. The joke takes this idea one step further by suggesting that the ducks are only doing this because they are being paid, which is not something that ducks would normally care about.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is a duck, and ducks eat bread, so the speaker is saying that the only reason they're attending the lecture is for the free food. This contrasts with the normal reasons humans would attend a lecture, like to gain knowledge or earn a degree.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the speaker is only a scientist for the money, or "bread." This is a play on the phrase "I'm in it for the long haul," meaning that the speaker is in a situation for the long term commitment. The joke is clever because it takes the concept of "the long haul" and applies it to ducks, which are known for their bread, or eggs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the stereotype that scientists are in it for the money (or "bread"). The fact that the scientists are surrounded by ducks alludes to the fact that ducks are often used in experiments (perhaps because they are easy to obtain and are not covered by animal protection laws). By saying that he's only in it for the bread, the scientist is saying that he's only in it for the money, i.e., he's not interested in the scientific research itself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it uses the common idiom "I'm only in it for the money" to contrast with the ducks being in the scene for the bread, which is what ducks usually eat. The joke is clever because it takes a common saying and applies it to a surprising and unexpected context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "I'm only in it for the bread" could mean two things: 1. I'm only in this (class, job, project, etc.) for the money/payment, or 2. I'm only eating this (food, etc.) because it's carbs/bread. In this context, the speaker is a duck eating bread in front of a computer, so the joke is that the speaker is only in the class to eat the bread (i.e. they're not actually there to learn).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is a duck, and ducks are often associated with bread, so the duck is saying that the only reason it is attending the lecture is for the food. This is a play on the idea that some students only go to lecture to get the free food that is often given out.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common saying "I'm only in it for the money." The ducks in this scene are not motivated by money, but by bread, which they are eating. This joke is clever because it makes a pun on the word "bread" which can mean both money and the food.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "I'm only in it for the money." The birds in this scene are presumably there to learn how to use computers, but the bird in the lab coat says he's only there for the bread, meaning he's not really interested in learning. This is a clever way of saying that the bird doesn't really care about the subject matter, he just wants the easy "A" that comes with passing the class.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="67.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="69.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
