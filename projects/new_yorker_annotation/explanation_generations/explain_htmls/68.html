This is a play on the phrase "culture of denial," which is often used to describe a group of people who refuses to acknowledge a problem or truth.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of the word "culture": in this context, culture refers to the customs and beliefs of a group of people, as represented by the statues. But the word "culture" can also refer to bacteria growing in a Petri dish, which is what the explorers are actually looking at. The joke is clever because it is both a play on words and a pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the statues are from a different culture that did not have the same view of the world as the famous statue. In this situation, the famous statue is from a Culture of Denial, which means a group of people who deny that certain things exist or are true. The fact that the statue is not smiling suggests that this culture does not believe in happiness, which is why the joke is funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "culture of denial." In one sense, a "culture of denial" refers to a society or group of people who refuse to acknowledge a problem or accept reality. In this case, the explorers are looking at the statues and remarking on how they look like they're in denial, i.e., they have blank expressions. However, the statues are actually in denial of their own reality, since they are not the real Easter Island heads.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the archeologists have found statues that are smiling, which is unusual because the real-life counterparts to these statues do not smile. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the "culture" of the statues is one of "denial," meaning that they are in denial of the reality that they do not smile. This is a clever way of saying that the statues are lying.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the archeologists have found a small, isolated group of people who deny that the famous statue exists. This is hard to believe, given that the statue is a well-known and famous work of art. The statue also has a very distinctive smile, which makes it even more implausible that these people would deny its existence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the archeologists have discovered a culture that is refusing to face reality. The statues are carved to look like they are smiling, but in actuality, they represent a time period or event that was probably not happy. The smile is a way of denial; by pretending to be happy, the culture is able to avoid acknowledging the truth.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the archeologists are finding statues that are smiling, which is the universal expression for happiness, but also denial. The contradiction between the two emotions makes the joke humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the statues are smiling despite the fact that they come from a culture that is known for its statues that have solemn, stoic expressions. The expressions on the statues are in contrast to the actual culture they come from, which gives the jokes its punchline.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Culture of denial" is a phrase often used to describe situations where people refuse to face reality or facts. In this case, the archeologists are facing objects that are in denial of the fact that they aren't actually happy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the archeologists are looking at statues that are smiling, which is strange because the statues are from Easter Island and the famous statues on Easter Island have solemn, serious faces. The smiles on the statues suggest that the culture was in denial about something, which is why they are smiling.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the archeologists are finding statues that are smiling, which is in contrast to the real-life statue which does not smile. This could be interpreted as a comment on how some cultures try to ignore or deny uncomfortable truths.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the statues on Easter Island have blank, expressionless faces. The joke is commentary on the explorer's culture: they are in denial about the fact that their culture is represented by these emotionless statues.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the denial refers both to the fact that the statues don't look like they're in pain, despite the hardships of their lives on Easter Island, as well as the archeologists' possible denial that these are different from the other, more famous statues.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the archeologists' discovery of the smiling statues on Easter Island is a parody of the famous Moai statues. The Moai are monolithic human figures carved by the Rapa Nui people on Easter Island in Polynesia; they are typically depicted with solemn, stoic expressions and are considered to be representatives of ancestor veneration. In contrast, the smiling statues found by the archeologists are a clear indication that the Rapa Nui people were in denial about the seriousness of their ancestor's expressions.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
