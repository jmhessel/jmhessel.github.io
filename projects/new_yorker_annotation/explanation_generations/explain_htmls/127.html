The mammoth is saying that the cavemen didn't bother him until they discovered fire, meaning that the cavemen's use of fire as a weapon was what made them a threat. However, the joke also suggests that the mammoth is bothered by the cavemen because they are literally on fire, as they are burning the mammoth alive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "fire": in the context of the cave, fire refers to the fact that the cavemen have discovered how to make fire, and are now using it to attack the mammoths. But, the word "fire" can also be used as a metaphor, in this case meaning that the cavemen are attacking the mammoths with such ferocity that it's as if they're on fire.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "it didn't really bother me until" is often used to describe how someone didn't realize how bad a situation was until a specific event happened. In this case, the event is the cavemen discovering fire, which would normally be considered a good thing. However, the fact that the fire is being used to roast the woolly mammoths alive makes it a bad thing, hence the joke.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="126.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="128.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
