I'm just here to kill time.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "to kill time" means to waste time, but in this context, it takes on a literal meaning as well. The grim reaper is, of course, the personification of death, and so by saying that he is just there to kill time, he is saying that he is there to do his job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The grim reaper is, of course, a personification of death, and so, when he says "No thanks, I'm just here to kill time," it's a double meaning: he's both saying that he doesn't want a beer, and also that he is literally there to kill time. The fact that he's at a bar is also significant because it's a place where people often drink to kill time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "killing time" is an idiom meaning to waste time. The man at the bar is talking to Death, who personifies time, and so is offering to help him kill time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the grim reaper is, by definition, death personified. So, when the man offers him a drink, the grim reaper deadpans that he's just there to kill time. It's a play on words because, while most people go to bars to socialize and have fun, the grim reaper's purpose is to, well, end time for people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while "killing time" is a common idiom meaning to waste time doing something unimportant, in this context, it takes on a more literal meaning. It's also funny because the grim reaper is often depicted as being actively involved in seeking out and causing death, but in this scenario, they are being offered a drink by someone who doesn't know who they are.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The Grim Reaper is, of course, a personification of death, and so the man's offer of a drink is actually an offer of death. However, the Reaper refuses, saying that he is just there to kill time. In other words, he is there to do the exact opposite of what the man wants him to do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "to kill time" is a common idiom meaning to spend time doing something that isn't productive because one is bored. However, in this context, the phrase takes on a new and more literal meaning: the grim reaper is at the bar to actually kill time, as in, to end its existence. The fact that the person offering the beer is unaware of this is what makes the joke humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "kill time": in this context, "kill time" could mean either to spend time in a leisurely way, or to literally kill someone. The grim reaper, being the personification of death, is of course referring to the latter meaning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "killing time." In this case, the man is talking to Death, who literally kills people. So, the man's statement that he's just there to kill time is both a pun and a warning to Death.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lady is offering Satan a drink, but he declined because he's "just here to kill time." This is a play on words because, in most cases, people go to bars to drink and have a good time, but Satan is literal about wanting to kill time. Additionally, it's ironic that the lady is happy to see Satan, even though he's, well, Satan.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the grim reaper is often associated with death, in this situation, he is just waiting around and killing time, rather than killing people. The contrast between the typically deadly connotations of the Grim Reaper with the more mundane reality of him just sitting in a bar is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the grim reaper's dual occupation: not only is he responsible for ushering souls into the afterlife, but he is also a personification of death itself. In this case, the man offering him a drink is unaware of the grim reaper's true identity and simply sees him as a customer at the bar who is killing time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the play on words with the phrase "to kill time". In this context, the phrase means to waste time doing something pointless or unproductive. However, the fact that Satan is present gives a whole new meaning to the phrase: instead of wasting time, Satan is there to literally kill time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "To kill time" means to occupy oneself so as to make time pass more slowly, but in this case, the lady is offering a drink to Satan, who is personification of death. So, the literal meaning of "to kill time" in this context would be to take an action that would cause time to pass more quickly, which is the opposite of what the lady is trying to do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The person in the bar is talking to Death, who is often seen as responsible for "killing" people. But in this case, Death is just sitting in the bar, killing time.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="126.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="128.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
