The word "spear" can refer to both the weapon and to a type of clothing worn by cavemen (and women). The caveman who is spear-wearing is saying that he is lucky he didn't accidentally wear the same spear that pierced the other caveman.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "wore": in the context of the cave paintings, "wore" would mean "depicted", as in "the cave painting depicts a man wearing a loincloth". However, the other meaning of "wore" is "had stuck through one's body", which is how the man in the scene actually has a spear.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who is impaled with the spear is wearing the same clothes as the person in the cave painting. The joke is a play on words, because "wore" can mean either "clothing" or "to have carried something," in this case, the spear. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the phrase "to wear the same shoes."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who just got impaled by the spear is making a joke about how it could have easily been avoided. He is saying that if he had just worn a different spear, one that wasn't already in the ground, he wouldn't have been impaled. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words --- "wore" can mean to carrying something, as in "I wore the spear on my back," but it can also mean to have an article of clothing on, as in "I wore the same shirt yesterday."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is talking seems to think that the fashion choice of wearing a spear through your chest is a close call, and that it's a shame the other man didn't make the same choice. The joke is a play on words because "wearing" can mean either to have something on your body or to bear the weight of something.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The person who almost wore the spear is talking about how they almost had the same accident as the person who did wear the spear (i.e. they almost got hit by a spear through their chest). The fact that they are both wearing the same spear in the painting is just a coincidence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it breaks the fourth wall. The caveman with the spear through his chest is aware that he is in a painting and that he looks like the caveman in the painting. The joke is a play on words, as well, because "wore" can mean to carry/have on one's person, as in "I wore the same spear," or "wore" can mean to be injured by, as in "I almost wore the same spear."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The caveman says he "almost wore the same spear", meaning he almost had the same accident, i.e., he almost got hit by a spear through the chest. This is a clever way of saying "I could have easily been in the same situation", or "that could have been me".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The caveman is saying that he almost wore the same spear, meaning that he almost had the same accident happen to him. This is ironic because the spear is actually through his chest.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is spear-wounded is wearing the exact same loincloth as the man in the painting. The fact that they are wearing the same clothes suggests that the painting is of the recent past, which would explain why the man in the painting is still alive to witness his own death. The spear injury is funny because it's a play on words --- the man was almost wearing the same spear, i.e., he was almost impaled in the same way as the man in the painting, but fortunately he was only hit with the spear, not impaled by it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man with the spear through his chest is saying that he almost wore the same spear, meaning that he almost had the spear go through his chest like the man in the painting. The other people in the cave find this amusing, likely because they've never heard such a clever play on words before.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The caveman says "I almost wore the same spear", meaning he almost had the same accident, but the audience hears "I almost wore the same clothes", which is a much less serious statement. The joke is clever because it's a double meaning that is only funny if you know about the cave paintings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The person who almost wore the same spear is referring to the cave painting, where the person who was hit by the spear is wearing a loincloth. The person who almost wore the same spear is saying that they, too, were about to wear a loincloth, but presumably decided not to at the last minute. The joke is clever because it's a double entendre: the person who almost wore the same spear is also referring to the fact that they almost got hit by the spear in real life, but dodged it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The caveman says that he "almost wore the same spear", meaning that if he had been wearing the same spear that was depicted in the cave painting, he would have been the one who got accidentally impaled. The joke is clever because it's a palindrome; "wore" and "rewo" are spelled the same backwards and forwards.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is describing how he almost wore the same spear that is currently going through his chest. This would be impossible, of course, because the spear is currently going through his chest. The joke is a play on words, with the phrase "I almost wore the same clothes" often used to describe how someone avoided an embarrassing fashion mishap.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
