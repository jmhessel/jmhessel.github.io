The shark is not actually going to be grilled, because he is a shark and needs to be in water to survive. The joke is a play on words, because the detective is asking the shark a question (grilling him) and the shark is looking at pictures (which can also be called grilling).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The police are investigating the shark, and one of the officers says that he plans to grill the shark. This could mean that he plans to question the shark harshly, or that he plans to cook the shark. Given that the shark is on land and thus out of its element, the latter interpretation is more likely, and thus, more humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The police are literally trying to grill the shark (by interrogating him), but the shark is also making a joke about how he could be grilled (as in, cooked on a grill) if he were taken out of the water. This is a play on the fact that sharks must stay in water or they will die.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because sharks are often grilled as food, but in this case, the shark is the one being grilled, as in interrogated. The detective is punning on the fact that they are in a room with a grill, and also that sharks are often grilled as food.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the idea of grilling a shark is absurd. Grilling is a method of cooking food over an open flame, and it would be impossible to do that to a shark since they need to be in water to live. The cop's comment also implies that he thinks the shark is guilty of something, and he plans to interrogate him (i.e., grill him) until he confesses.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is holding a picture of a shark being grilled on a barbecue. This is a play on words because the cop is also asking the shark questions about a crime, and "grilling" can also mean to interrogate someone. The joke is also funny because it's impossible for the shark to be grilled, since it would die out of water.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the word "grill" can mean two things: to interrogate someone harshly, or to cook food on a grill. Given the setting of the interrogation room, with the bright light shining down on the shark, it's clear that the cops are trying to grill the shark in both senses of the word.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while in most cases, "to grill someone" means to interrogate them, in this case, the word "grill" also has a literal meaning, as in, to cook meat on a grill. The fact that the person being interrogated is a shark, and that sharks are typically grilled, makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is punning on the fact that both interrogation and grilling involve asking questions. However, the cop is also playing on the fact that sharks need water to survive, and so grilling him would literal kill the shark.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The police are interrogating the shark, and one cop makes a pun about grilling, which is a type of cooking. The joke is also funny because it's a situation where the shark is out of its element (literally), and is thus at a disadvantage.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The detective is asking the shark questions in an attempt to get information from him, but the shark is punningly replying that he expects to be grilled, as in, cooked on a barbecue. The detective, not understanding the pun, might interpret the shark's words literally and try to grill him, which of course would be counterproductive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The detective is asking the shark about his plans, and the shark replied with a pun about being grilled, as in spices being put on a barbecue, versus the more literal meaning of being interrogated under hot lights. The play on words is humorous because it is unexpected in the context of a serious interrogation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is threatening to grill the shark, which is a thinly-veiled reference to the fact that the shark will die if it is not in water. The cop is using this as a way to intimidate the shark into talking, but the joke is that the cop doesn't realize that the shark is literally going to die if he does this.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The cop is asking the shark questions (interrogating him), and the shark knows that he will eventually be killed (grilled).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The cop is holding a photo of the shark, which is likely to be used as evidence in a trial. However, the cop could also be planning to grill the shark (i.e. cook it) as part of their interrogation, rather than simply grill him with questions. The Shark is making a joke about the cop's plans, which could go either way.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="88.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="90.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
