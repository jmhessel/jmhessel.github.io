He didn't say how.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays with the fact that the dog's owner put the cone on the dog's head to keep him from scratching a wound, but the dog has found a way to still scratch his wound by wearing the cone backwards.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is not wearing the cone properly. This could be interpreted in two ways: first, that the dog is simply wearing the cone backwards, which is funny because it's a silly mistake. Second, it could be interpreted as the dog not following the instructions properly, which is funny because it's a dog and it's not expected to be able to follow complex instructions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cone is worn to protect the animal from scratching itself, but it's not effective if it's worn backwards. The dog is saying that the other dog, the one with the cone on correctly, was told to wear it, but wasn't given instructions on how to wear it. The implication is that the first dog doesn't understand why the cone is worn in the first place and thinks it's some sort of silly game.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is wearing the cone in the wrong way. The cone is meant to prevent the dog from scratching its head, but by wearing it backwards, the dog can still scratch its head. The dog is technically following the rules, but in a way that defeats the purpose.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is not wearing the cone properly. The cone is meant to prevent the dog from scratching its head, but the dog has simply turned it around so that it is not effective. The dog is implying that it does not care about following the rules and that it will do things its own way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is wearing the cone in a way that is not how it is supposed to be warn. The cone is supposed to go around the neck and the dog has it around its head. This is humorous because it is a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is not following the vet's orders on how to wear the cone. The dog is wearing the cone to protect its neck/head area, but by wearing it backwards, it's not being effective. The joke is clever because it's playing on the fact that the dog is not intelligent enough to understand the cone's purpose and is instead just following the letter of the vet's instruction without understanding the spirit.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The dog is saying that the other dog is not wearing the cone correctly, but the other dog does not care. This is because the other dog was told to wear the cone, but not how to wear it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog implies that he doesn't care about following the rules for wearing the cone, he just wanted to be sure followed the rule of wearing it. This is silly because the only reason to wear the cone is to follow the rule, and so the dog has misunderstood the purpose of the cone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog has been put in an Elizabethan collar, which is a cone-shaped piece of plastic or fabric that is placed around an animal's neck to prevent them from licking or scratching a wound. The dog's owner likely put the collar on correctly, with the pointy end facing away from the dog's head, but the dog has managed to put it on backwards, so the pointy end is facing towards its head. The dog is probably still trying to lick or scratch its wound, which is why the owner put the cone on in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is not wearing the cone properly. The cone is supposed to go around the dog's neck, but instead, it is placed on backwards. This situation is funny because it is a reversal of the expected use of the cone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is wearing the cone properly while the other dog is wearing it backwards. The cone is meant to keep the dog from licking its wounds, but by wearing it backwards, the dog can still lick its wounds. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the dog is following the "letter" of the instruction (to wear the cone), but not the "spirit" (to not lick its wounds).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the dog wearing the cone backwards is defying the orders of the veterinarian who put the cone on him in the first place. The joke is clever because it is a play on words --- the question is not "how" the cone is supposed to be worn, but rather "how" the dog is supposed to wear the cone (i.e. in what position).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog wearing the cone backwards is technically following the order to wear the cone, but not following the proper way to wear it. This suggests that the dog is not very bright or obedient, and is perhaps taking the letter of the rule rather than the spirit.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is wearing the cone backwards, which presumably means that the owner told him to wear it, but didn't say how. This punchline implies that the dog doesn't really understand why he has to wear the cone, but is just following the instructions he was given.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="172.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="174.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
