The joke is clever because it is a play on words --- when you hear a heartbeat, it usually sounds like "lub-dub, lub-dub." However, in this case, the heartbeat sounds like something else entirely: "thump-thump." This is a clever way to make a joke about Superman's weakness without actually mentioning Kryptonite.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between how Superman is usually portrayed (as a powerful superhero) and how he is being portrayed in this scene (as a patient in a doctor's office). The joke is a play on words because when someone says "sounds like a bird," they are usually saying it to describe the sound of someone coughing, but in this case, the doctor is actually hearing the sound of Superman's X-ray vision.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is using a stethoscope to listen to Superman's heartbeat and says that it sounds like a bird, which is the sound that a normal person's heartbeat would make. However, Superman's heartbeat is so fast that it actually sounds like a plane, which is much faster than a bird.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Superman is so strong that he doesn't need to go to the doctor. The fact that he is there anyway, and that the doctor is making a joke about how he thought Superman was a bird or a plane, suggests that the doctor is not used to treating such an unusual patient.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor's dialogue is a play on Superman's catchphrase, "It's a bird, it's a plane." In this context, the doctor is using a stethoscope to listen to Superman's heartbeat, and he mistakes the sound of Superman's heartbeat for the sound of a bird or a plane. This is funny because it's a very small, unimportant detail that the doctor could have easily missed, but it's also a detail that Superman himself would be familiar with.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Superman is a superhero who is famous for his ability to fly. The doctor's joke is a play on words because when he listens to Superman's heartbeat, he says it sounds like a bird, which is homophone for the word "heard". This joke is also a play on Superman's persona as a superhero who disguises himself as a mild-mannered reporter, Clark Kent.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Superman is known for his invincible status and his ability to fly. The fact that he is at the doctor's office and the doctor is listening to his heartbeat through a stethoscope is a bit odd, because Superman is usually not depicted as being sick or having any sort of physical ailment. The joke uses Superman's catchphrase, "It's a bird, it's a plane", to poke fun at the fact that he is in a doctor's office.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Superman's heartbeat should sound normal, like a human's heartbeat. However, because he is superpowered, his heartbeat actually sounds like a bird or a plane. This is surprising because it's not what one would expect from a doctor's office visit.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor's line is a play on Superman's famous catchphrase, "Look, up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane!", which is used when he's about to save people from some sort of danger. In this case, the danger is Superman's own health, which is ironic given his super-human abilities.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is making a joke about how Superman is so strong that he doesn't need a check-up. Instead of diagnosing Superman with something, the doctor says that he sounds like a bird or a plane, which is amusing because it's what people often say when they see Superman flying.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Superman's heartbeat should theoretically be inaudible to the human ear, but the doctor's use of a stethoscope implies that it is in fact audible. The joke then imagines what Superman's heartbeat might sound like, borrowing from the common pop culture phrase "it's a bird, it's a plane," which is used to describe Superman's arrival.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The doctor is trying to diagnose Superman's problem, but he can't figure it out. Superman then says that his problem is that he can't see without his glasses, and the doctor realizes that he's been trying to diagnose Superman the whole time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is trying to listen to Superman's heartbeat, but instead hears the sound of a bird or a plane. This is because Superman is so fast that his heartbeat is inaudible to humans. The joke plays on the idea that Superman is so super that he is beyond the normal human experience.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on Superman's catchphrase, "Look! Up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Superman!" In this case, the doctor is trying to listen to Superman's heart with a stethoscope, but he can't hear it because Superman is so strong. The irony is that Superman is usually so strong that he can hear things that other people can't, but in this case, his strength is working against him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The doctor is trying to guess what is causing the noise that Superman is hearing, and he first says it sounds like a bird. However, Superman is actually hearing a plane, which is what the doctor then says. The joke is clever because it is a play on the well-known phrase "it's a bird, it's a plane," which is used to describe Superman.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="172.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="174.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
