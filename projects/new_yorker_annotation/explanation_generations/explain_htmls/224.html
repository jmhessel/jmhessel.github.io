"There's always room for cello" is a pun on the phrase "there's always room for Jell-O", which is a dessert. The addition of the word "cello" changes the meaning of the phrase to be about music instead of food, which is ironic because there is no room for a cello in the kitchen where the chefs are fighting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the phrase "there's always room for dessert/jello". In this case, the phrase is modified to be "there's always room for cello", meaning that even though there is a lot of violence going on in the kitchen, the female chef playing the cello is still managing to create a beautiful and serene moment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the saying "there's always room for dessert". In the context of the scene, the joke is funnier because the viola playing chef is interrupting the fight, potentially saving the life of the chef being chased, by playing acello, which is a calmer and more peaceful instrument.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "there's always room for dessert" is a common way of saying that one can always make space for something sweet. In this case, the woman playing the cello is doing so in the middle of a knife-fight, which adds a level of danger and excitement to the music. The joke also works on the double meaning of the word "chef": in addition to being a cook, a chef can also be the head of a kitchen. In this case, the woman playing the cello is the head of the kitchen, and she is using her position of power to stay out of the fight.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "there's always room for" ____ is typically used to mean that there's always space or time for ____, but in this case, it's used to mean that there's always space in a room for a cello. The cello is oversized, so it's taking up a lot of space in the room, which is why the waiter says it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is so absurd: two people having a casual conversation while a chef chases another chef with a knife. The joke is a play on words, as the word "cello" can refer to both the musical instrument and a type of food. In the context of the joke, the word "cello" is a pun for "jello," which is a type of food that is often served in restaurants.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "there's always room for ____" is usually used to mean that there is always space or room for more of something, like love or dessert. However, in this context, the phrase means that there is always room for cello, even in a murder scene where there is a giant fish on the floor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the saying "there's always room for dessert." The joke substitutes the word "cello" for "dessert" to make it more sophomoric. This also makes the joke a pun, as the cello is a type of string instrument. The joke is also made funnier by the fact that the woman chef is actually playing a viola, which is a type of string instrument that is similar to the cello.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Room for cello" could mean that there is space for someone to play the cello in the restaurant, or it could mean that the waiters are talking about leaving room for a dessert (i.e., something sweet) after the meal. The second meaning is funnier because it is a more unexpected interpretation in the context of a fight happening with knives.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of the word "cello". In the context of the kitchen, a "cello" is another name for a violation, which is an act of aggression. However, the word can also refer to a musical instrument, which is what the female chef is playing. The joke is clever because it uses the two meanings of the word to make a pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the phrase "there's always room for Jell-O". In this context, the phrase is used to mean that even though there is a fight happening, there is still room for another musician (cello) to join in. The joke is also funny because it implies that the person playing the viola is not very good at fighting, and is more interested in playing music than in protecting herself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man playing the cello is nonchalantly playing music while a chef is trying to murder another chef with knives in the kitchen. The cello playing distracts from the fact that there is a murder taking place, making it seem like a normal occurrence. Furthermore, the fact that the waiters are more concerned with the fish on the floor than the murder happening in front of them reinforces the idea that this is a normal occurrence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the viola is a less common and less popular musical instrument compared to the cello. The fact that someone is playing the viola in the middle of a fight is unexpected and humorous. Additionally, the joke is a play on words because "cello" can also refer to a cell or prison, implying that the person playing the viola will eventually be put in jail for their involvement in the fight.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "there's always room for Jell-O" --- in this case, the cello is a type of musical instrument, not a dessert. The fact that the joke is made in the middle of a fight between two chefs adds to the humor, because it's unexpected.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="223.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="225.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
