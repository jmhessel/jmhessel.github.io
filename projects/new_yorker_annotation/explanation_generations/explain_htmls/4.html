In this scene, the people are inside of bubbles, and they are happy about it because it means they have their freedom and fresh air. The bubble represents a sort of "new normal" for these people, and the joke pokes fun at how people can adapt to strange situations.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people are talking as if being surrounded by a large bubble is the new normal, when in reality, it would be a very weird and stressful thing to happen to anyone. The joke is even funnier if you imagine that the people used to be even more isolated, e.g., inside of a house or a hospital, and now they are at least out on the street corner talking to each other.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman says "to think" as if the current situation, people walking around in large bubbles, is better than the previous situation, people being stuck inside. Most people would view being stuck inside as preferable to having to walk around in a large bubble, so the woman's comment is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people are inside of bubbles, which is a metaphor for isolation. The irony is that a year ago, people were actually stuck inside because of the pandemic, but now they are outside and isolated in bubbles.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the current COVID-19 pandemic and the social distancing measures that have been put in place to prevent the spread of the disease. In the past year, many people have been stuck inside due to lockdowns and quarantine measures, but the person in this scene is joking that, compared to now, being stuck inside wasn't so bad. The joke is clever because it's true; a year ago, people didn't know about COVID-19 and so weren't taking the precautions that are now necessary.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is poking fun at the people who have become mysophobic, or afraid of germs, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. These people have become so afraid of germs that they are living their lives inside bubbles, completely cut off from the outside world. The joke is that, even though they are living in complete isolation, they are still better off than they were a year ago when they were stuck inside with all the other people in the world.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The people are inside of the bubbles, but they are also inside in the sense that they are safe from the virus. A year ago, we were all stuck inside because we were afraid to go outside and get sick. Now, we are inside because we want to stay healthy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The people are inside of bubbles, but they are also inside of their homes, since they are on the sidewalk. A year ago, we were all stuck inside of our homes because of the pandemic, but now we are stuck inside of our bubbles. The joke is a way of pointing out how absurd the current situation is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The people in the bubbles are inside, but they are also outside, which is the opposite of what a year ago would have been. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the current situation, where many people are stuck inside because of the pandemic and social distancing measures, while others are outside enjoying the good weather.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the current 2020 global pandemic of Covid-19. In the outbreak, social distancing measure have been employed to help prevent the spread of the disease, which often means maintaining a distance of six feet or more from other people. The bubble around each person is a visual representation of that social distancing, and the joke is that, compared to a year ago, when people were "stuck inside" (likely referring to being stuck indoors due to quarantines), the current situation of being able to go outside and be surrounded by a bubble isn't so bad.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is talking about how a year ago everyone was "stuck inside" because of the pandemic, but the man mishears her and thinks she says "stuck in side," as in, a person's individual bubble. The irony is that even though people are physically distancing themselves from others by being in their own bubbles, they are still figuratively "stuck inside" because they can't interact with others in the same way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people in the bubble are talking as if they have just come out of the bubble, when in reality they have been living in the bubble for a year. It's a play on the fact that people often say "to think, a year ago we were all in this situation" to describe how much things have changed in a short period of time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people are talking while they are socially distancing themselves from each other. The bubbles are a barrier that would normally prevent people from talking to each other, but in this case they are using it as an opportunity to talk. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the phrase "to think", as in "to think about how things were a year ago". In this case, the woman is saying that it's amazing to think about how a year ago they were all stuck inside, i.e., not able to go outside and talk to people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The people in the bubbles are "stuck inside," but they are inside the bubbles by choice, not because they are trapped. The joke is clever because it's true that a year ago, these people were probably stuck inside, either because of the pandemic or because of their fear of germs (mysophobia).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to the global pandemic of 2020, in which many people were forced to stay inside due to the spread of the disease. Thebubbles around the people walking down the sidewalk represents the social distancing that was necessary during the pandemic. The fact that the woman is talking to the man suggests that they are old friends or acquaintances, and the woman is making a joke about how things have changed in the past year.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="3.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="5.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
