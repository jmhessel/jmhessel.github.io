In this case, the boss is telling the employee that they will have "one more try" to do something, but the catch is that the try will be when the music starts, which suggests that the try will be a dance or some other performance that is not related to work. The joke is funny because it's a clever way to tell the employee that they're Fired in a roundabout way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's boss is telling him that he will only have "one more try," which could mean either one more chance to do something or one more try at a musical chairs-type game. The fact that the boss is sitting in a chair far away from the man, and there are many chairs between them, implies that the game being referred to is musical chairs. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: in musical chairs, when the music stops, people "try" to find a seat, and in this situation, the man will have "one more try" when the music starts.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that there are too many chairs, which suggests that there are too many people in the room. The joke uses this surplus of chairs to create a sense of anticipation and suspense, as if the extra people are waiting for something to happen, like a musical performance to start. The fact that there are too many chairs also makes the joke more difficult to understand, as it's not clear why there would be so many chairs in the room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man behind the desk is saying that the other man will have another chance to try (i.e., to attempt something), but the man in the foreground is sitting in a row of chairs, so it could also be interpreted that he will have another chance to try (i.e., to sit in a chair). The joke is also clever because it is a play on the phrase "you will have to wait your turn," which is often said to children.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is telling his coworker that he will have another chance to complete his task, but the task is sitting in a line of chairs. The man is saying that his coworker will have to wait until the "music starts" (i.e., the line of chairs moves) before he can try again.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's boss is telling him that he will have to wait his turn, just like the other children, when the music starts. This is a reference to the children's game musical chairs, where there are not enough chairs for everyone, and the music starts and stops, and people have to scramble to find a seat. When the music stops, the person without a seat is out of the game. In this case, the person without a seat is the man who is trying to talk to his boss.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is sitting in the back of the line is presumably waiting to talk to the CEO, but the CEO is telling him that he will have to wait until the music starts again. This is a play on words because the man is sitting in the "backseat" of the line, and the CEO is telling him that he will have to "wait his turn."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the game show "The Price is Right," where contestants are called up to come down an aisle to play a game. The game show host often tells the contestant that they will have one more try when the music starts. In this case, the boss is telling their employee that they will have one more try, but it's not clear what they are trying to accomplish.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is telling the employee that they will have another chance to improve, or else they will be fired, when the music starts. The music is probably a reference to the chair equivalent of musical chairs, where there is one less chair than the number of people playing and someone gets eliminated when the music stops. In this case, theboss is telling the employee that they will be eliminated if they don't improve.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the game "Musical Chairs." In that game, there are typically fewer chairs than there are people playing, so when the music starts, everyone runs to find a seat. The person left standing is out of the game. However, in this scene, there are more chairs than people, so the person in the back will have plenty of chances to find a seat. The boss telling them they will have "one more try" is a humorous way of telling them they don't need to hurry.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in the back is sitting in a "time-out" chair, usually meant for children. The fact that there is a time-out chair in an office implies that the boss is used to dealing with disorderly employees; the joke is that the person in the back is being treated like a child.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man behind the desk is the CEO, and the man in the foreground is an author who is waiting to have his book proposal heard. The CEO is telling the author that he will only have one more chance to make his case when "the music starts," meaning when the author's time is up and he needs to leave the office. However, the author is sitting in a chair, which could also be called a "seat," as in a "seat at the table." Thus, the author will only have one more chance to make his case when he's given a "seat at the table," or when he's published.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is an example of a non-sequitur. The boss says that the person will have one more try when the music starts, but there is no music playing and no reason to believe that there is any music that will start playing. The joke is humorous because it is unexpected and does not make sense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is telling the employee that they will have "one more try" at their job, as if it's a game or a challenge. This is a surprising way to hear about someone's job, and it's made even more surreal by the fact that the boss says it will happen "when the music starts." This could mean that the boss is going to play music to signal when the employee's final chance will start, or it could be a metaphor for the employee needing to be in the right place at the right time. In any case, it's a strange way to find out that someone is about to lose their job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the game "Musical Chairs"; in that game, there are usually more people than chairs, and when the music starts, the people walk around the chairs until the music stops, at which point everyone rushes to sit in a chair. The person who doesn't get a chair is eliminated. In this joke, the person who doesn't get a chair is the person who will be fired.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="3.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="5.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
