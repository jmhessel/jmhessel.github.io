The metaphor is that the gingerbread man is a "confection" that has "spread" (i.e. gotten larger or taken over) the body. This is amusing because it's a very technical way to describe something that is, essentially, a cookie.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is telling the gingerbread man that he's afraid the gingerbread man's condition has worsened, and the gingerbread man is literally made of gingerbread.
