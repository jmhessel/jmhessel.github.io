The joke is based on the fact that when lobsters are served in restaurants, they are often served with their claws bound by rubber bands to prevent them from causes injury. Thus, the man is saying that he will bind her hands with rubber bands if she continues to behave in a way that he doesn't like.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's lobster hands are a metaphor for his penis, which is also red and has claws/fingers. The woman is saying that if he touches her with his lobster hands again, she'll put a rubber band on his penis to make it smaller. This is a reference to a common practice among men with larger-than-average penises, who will put a rubber band around the base of their penis to make it appear smaller.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a threat disguised as a benign statement. The man with lobster claws is saying that if the woman continues to upset him, he will put rubber bands on his claws, which is what is done when preparing lobster for cooking. The woman is presumably upset because she doesn't want to be eaten.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "put the rubber bands back on" is a reference to how lobster claws are often kept together with a rubber band so that they don't snap at people. However, in this context, it means that the woman will put a rubber band on the man's lobster claws if he does something she doesn't like again. The fact that the man has lobster claws is strange and unusual, so the joke is even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a threat made by the man with lobster claws. The joke is funnier if you imagine that the woman had just done something that annoyed the man, and he's threatening her with the lobster claws. The joke is also funny because it's a non-standard use of rubber bands --- usually, rubber bands are used to keep lobster claws from opening, but in this case, the man is threatening to put them back on his own claws to make them more dangerous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's reaction is appropriate if her partner has just done something painful to her with his lobster claws, but is incongruous with the reality that they are simply walking down the street. The joke is clever because it playfully subverts the stereotype of a man with big muscles being rough with his partner, by instead suggesting that he is capable of gentle restraint (with rubber bands).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that usually when a person threatens to put "rubber bands" on something, they are saying that they will throw it away or dispose of it. In this case, the man is saying that he will put the rubber bands back on the lobster claws, implying that he will eat them again, which is a much more severe (and dangerous) punishment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's lobster claws are a metaphor for his wife's "ball and chain." The joke is making a play on words, implying that if the man doesn't stop whatever he's doing, his wife will put a figurative "rubber band" around his metaphorical "lobster claw" to restrict his movements.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a threat that is not possible to follow through on; the man cannot put the rubber bands back on his lobster claws because he does not have opposable thumbs. The woman is mad because the man is doing something that is bothersome or annoying, but the threat is not effective because the man cannot actually do what she is asking.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the threat of the lobster hands. The woman looks unhappy because she's probably been dealing with the lobster hands all day, and the man is bemused because he's probably never seen anything like it before. The rubber bands are probably used to keep the lobster hands from snapping at people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it uses the contrast between the dangerous-looking claws and the banal object of rubber bands to create a humorous effect. The joke makes light of the fact that the man's claws could be considered dangerous weapons, but they are easily controlled with simple rubber bands.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a threat made in response to a light-hearted request. The woman's upset expression and the man's lobster claws imply that he has just finished eating seafood, and she's asking him not to lick his fingers (perhaps because she doesn't want him to get food on her). The fact that he's warning her that he'll put the rubber bands back on his lobster claws suggests that he's done this before, and she's either seen it and found it disgusting, or he's done it in response to her request in the past and she's found it humorous. Either way, the juxtaposition of the request (which is innocent or even silly) with the threat (which is much more serious) is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's lobster hands are a threat to the woman, who does not want to be constrained by rubber bands again. The joke is also funny because it is an example of anthropomorphism --- attributing human characteristics to animals or objects --- in this case, attributing lobster hands to a human.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's reaction to the lobster claws is out of proportion to the situation. Thejoke is making fun of the woman's reaction, not the man's lobster claws. The joke is also funny because rubber bands are typically used to keep lobster claws from moving.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In the context of the scene, the man has lobster claws for hands, and so the woman's threat is to put rubber bands on his claws to prevent him from doing whatever it is that he did. However, the phrase "put the rubber bands back on" can also mean to reversing something or undoing something. So, the woman is also saying that she will reverse the man's transformation into a lobster.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="117.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="119.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
