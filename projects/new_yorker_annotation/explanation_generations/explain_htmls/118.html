The joke is playing on the common phrase "I blame X," where X is the cause of some problem. In this case, the cause of the problem is inflation, or the beach ball expanding to an unexpectedly large size.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is attributing the cause of the abnormally large beach ball to inflation, which is usually used to describe the higher prices of goods over time. In this case, the joke is that the beach ball has become so expensive that it's the size of a swimming pool.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually when someone says they "blame inflation," they mean that the rising cost of living is causing prices to go up. In this case, the person is saying that inflation is to blame for the beach ball taking up so much space in the pool.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the beach ball is so big that it's taking up the entire pool. The person who made the joke is presumably blaming the economy for the high cost of beach balls, which has led to such large beach balls.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The beach ball is "inflated," meaning that it is filled with air, but "inflation" also refers to a rise in prices. Thus, the joke is that the beach ball is so large because prices have gone up, or "inflated." This is a clever way to make a joke about inflation, which is often considered a dry topic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a common cause of inflation is when the money supply grows faster than the economy, and in this case, the beach ball has taken over the pool, growing to an unprecedented size. The joke is that the beach ball's size is due to inflation, in a similar way to how money can grow in value due to inflation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person blames the rising cost of living, or inflation, for the increasingly absurd size of the beach ball in the pool. This is absurd because inflation doesn't directly increase the size of objects, but rather the price of them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the balloon in the pool is so big that it could be seen as a metaphor for inflation. In other words, the balloon is so big that it's taking up all the space in the pool, just like how inflation can cause prices to "rise" or "inflate."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the pool is so full of the beach ball that there is no room for water, which is the substance pools are typically filled with. The fact that the pool is completely filled with the beach ball is a visual representation of inflation, which is when prices go up due to increases in the money supply.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the beach ball is so large that it is taking up the entire pool. This is a play on the economic concept of inflation, where the value of money decreases over time, i.e., things cost more. In this case, the beach ball is costing the pool-goers the use of the pool, as they can't swim in it because the ball is taking up the entire space.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is suggesting that the beach ball is so big because of inflation, the increase in the general level of prices and fall in the purchasing value of money. The joke is funny because it's a non-sensical application of a real-world phenomena to a silly object.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the pool is so full of the beach ball that there is no room for water, which is usually what goes in pools. The man's statement is a play on words, as the word "inflation" can refer to both the over-abundance of the beach ball in the pool, and the economic concept of inflation, which is when prices rise due to an increase in the money supply.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. Inflation, when applied to economics, is an increase in prices and decrease in the purchasing power of money. However, in this context, the person is saying that the inflation of the beach ball is to blame for the fact that the pool is full. This is a play on words because, technically, inflation does cause things to become fuller, but in this case, it's the beach ball that is being inflated, not the pool.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The beach ball is large because of inflation (i.e. it's been inflated with air), but inflation can also refer to the economic phenomenon. Thus, the speaker is saying that the large beach ball is due to the current state of the economy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the beach ball is so large that it is taking up the entire pool. The person is joking that the cause of the beach ball's size is inflation, which is an economic term that refers to the increase in the price of goods and services over time. In this case, the person is saying that the beach ball has gotten so expensive that it has taken over the entire pool.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="117.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="119.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
