The man with the briefcase is clearly a politician, and the man on the island is welcoming him to "paradise". But, the man on the island is also implying that the politician is a "paradise" because he has won another term. The joke is clever because it is both a pun and a play on the politician's character.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the island is clearly happy and enjoying himself, while the man with the briefcase looks like he has just been through a major hardship, e.g., he was shipwrecked. The joke is clever because it plays on the double meaning of "term": a term can refer to the length of a political leader's time in office (which the man on the island assumes), but it can also refer to a difficult period of time, which is what the man with the briefcase has just been through.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the island is tanning himself and holding a drink, which is a symbol of relaxation and vacation. The other man, who is disheveled and has a briefcase, is a symbol of work. The joke is that the man on the island is enjoying his paradise, while the other man is stuck working, even though he is on an island.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="117.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="119.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
