Its over.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the story of Noah's Ark. In the Bible story, Noah was instructed by God to build an ark and fill it with animals to save them from the great flood. In this joke, the man in the boat is named Noah, and he is being told by the other man that the flood is over and he can stop rowing. This is funny because it's a reversal of the traditional story.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the boat is clearly delusional, and is refusing to accept that there is no water for him to row in. The man crawling on the ground is trying to be supportive, but is also trying to be realistic. This joke plays off the trope of a man refusing to accept reality, even when it is staring him in the face.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the biblical story of Noah's Ark. In the story, Noah is instructed by God to build an Ark and to fill it with two of every animal to escape a flood. In this joke, the man in the boat is Noah, and the man crawling through the sand is telling him that it's time to give up because the flood is long over. This is funny because it's a reversal of the original story.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="86.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="88.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
