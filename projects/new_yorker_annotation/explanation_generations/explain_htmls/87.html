What if your sister-in-law is also right about God?</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it presupposes two things that are patently false: first, that the man's sister-in-law is always right, and second, that the yeti is real. The yeti, of course, is a mythical creature, and therefore, the man's worry that his sister-in-law is right about god, another mythical being, is unfounded.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "oh, shit!" is typically used as a swear word when someone is surprised or worried. In this case, the hikers are surprised because they see a yeti, which is a creature that is often described as being like a cross between a ape and a man. The fact that they are worried about their sister-in-law being right about God suggests that they may hold religious beliefs that conflict with the idea of Bigfoot's existence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it subverts the trope of one person not believing in something (in this case, the existence of the yeti, or bigfoot) despite evidence to the contrary being right in front of them. In this joke, the person who doesn't believe in the yeti is instead worried about their sister-in-law being right about God, which is a much more abstract and difficult to believe concept. This reversal is humorous because it is unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it turns out that the man's wife was right about the yeti after all, and he is now worried that if his wife was right about the yeti, then she might also be right about God. This is a play on the common anxiety that people have about whether or not they believe in God, and how that can be a source of tension in relationships.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it hypothetical situation of the yeti's existence is so absurd that it causes the person to question their other beliefs. If yetis exist, then anything is possible, no matter how outlandish, so the person's other beliefs, like the existence of God, might also be true.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it takes the situation, which is already strange because of the possibility of seeing a yeti, and makes it even stranger by introducing the religious element of God. The speaker is effectively saying, "this situation is so bizarre and unlikely that even other unlikely things could also be true." The joke is doubly funny because, of course, there is no evidence that yetis exist, let alone that they are related to God in any way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non sequitur. The two people are worried about the yeti, which is an unreal creature, and then one person says something that has nothing to do with the yeti: that if his sister-in-law is right about God, then that would be bad. The joke is funny because it's a sudden change in topic and it's unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "oh, shit" is often used when someone realizes they are in a bad or dangerous situation. In this case, the hikers are in a bad situation because they are about to be attacked by a yeti. But the phrase can also be read as "oh, shit! What if your sister-in-law is also right about God?" This would be a surprising realization for the hikers to have, as it would suggest that they had been doubting the existence of God despite being in the presence of a yeti, which is a creature that is often associated with legend and myth.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the saying "oh, shit," which is often used as an exclamation of surprise or fear. In this case, the hikers are surprised at the prospect of their sister-in-law being right about God, i.e., that God exists, which would mean that the yeti behind them is also real.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it posits a ridiculous hypothetical: what if, not only is the speaker's sister-in-law correct that a mythical creature is real, but also that a god exists? The joke pokes fun at the idea that someone could believe in two things that are so unlikely.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman hikers is worried that if her husband's sister is right about the Yeti, then she might also be right about God. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the phrase "Oh, shit!" is usually used as an expression of surprise or fear, but in this context, it takes on a new meaning of feeling upset or worried about something.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common phrase "oh, shit." The phrase is usually used when someone realizes they've made a mistake or are in a difficult situation. In this case, the situation is finding out that a yeti exists, which is far from ideal. However, the speaker is more concerned with the implications of this yeti's existence on his sister-in-law's religious beliefs being correct. This second, more absurd concern, is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "oh, shit!" which is often used as an expletive when someone is surprised or worried. In this case, the man is surprised and worried because he sees a yeti, which is a creature that is often associated with myths and legends. Seeing a yeti would be proof that yetis exist, and if yetis exist, than that means that other creatures associated with myths and legends, like God, might also exist. This would be a very bad thing for the man, as it would challenge his disbelief in such things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "oh, shit!" is often used to express surprise or fear, but in this case the person who said it is surprised at the idea that their sister-in-law could be right. The phrase "right about God" could mean that the person's sister-in-law is religious and believes in God, or it could mean that the person's sister-in-law is correct in some other way. The joke is funny because it's unexpected and because it makes you think about the different ways the phrase could be interpreted.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. If Bigfoot, or the Yeti, is real then that would mean that your sister-in-law is also right about God, which is a topic that people often argue about. The joke is clever because it uses the Yeti as a way to make a point about how people argue about God, and how there is often no real evidence to support either side.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="86.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="88.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
