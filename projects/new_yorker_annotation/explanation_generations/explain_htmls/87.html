The cop is essentially asking the shark if it can remember something from a week ago, which is a lot to ask of anyone, let alone a shark. What's especially funny is that the cop is asking this question while trying to act tough, but it's a ridiculous question to ask in this situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's impossible for the shark to remember what he had for lunch last Thursday because he can't survive out of water for more than a few minutes. The joke is playing on the fact that sharks have very poor eyesight and rely heavily on their sense of smell to find food.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is interrogating the shark in a way that is not going to be productive. He's asking the shark questions about what he did last week, even though the shark has no way of remembering because sharks have very poor long-term memory. The cop is wasting his time, which is why the joke is funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common police interrogation technique of asking a person questions that they should know the answer to, in order to trip them up if they are lying. In this case, the police are interrogating a shark, who of course would not be able to remember what he had for lunch last Thursday, because he's a fish and can't survive out of water for that long.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the interrogation technique of asking someone to remember something from a specific day/time is used in order to trip them up, and it's especially difficult if that day was a week ago. However, this particular shark being interrogated probably can't remember what he had for lunch last Thursday because he has no short-term memory: he's a shark. Thus, the police are using a technique that is specifically designed to not work on their suspect.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police are interrogating the shark as if he's a human criminal. They are asking him a very specific question about his whereabouts on a certain day and what he ate for lunch. They are doing this despite the fact that sharks die when they're out of water, so the question is moot.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police are trying to catch the shark in a lie by asking him a question that they know he would have no way of knowing the answer to. While sharks have a bad reputation, they aren't known for being particularly intelligent, so this interrogation tactic is unlikely to succeed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is interrogation the shark about a crime, but the only way he knows how to do it is by asking questions that sharks can't answer, like what it ate for lunch last Thursday. This is silly because, while the cop is trying to be serious, he's not using the proper methods to interrogation a shark, which would be asking it questions about the water, its habitat, etc.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the interrogating cop is asking a loaded question: the shark, of course, does not remember what it had for lunch last Thursday because it does not have the capacity for long-term memory (as far as we know). This is similar to how humans often can't remember what they had for lunch two days ago, let alone a week ago. The cop's question implicitly acknowledges this fact, but is still putting pressure on the shark to answer.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the detectives are interrogating the shark as if it were a human suspect. One of the classic interrogation tactics is to try and trip the suspect up by asking them a specific question about something that they would not be able to answer, in order to get them to confess. However, in this case, the detectives are using this tactic on a shark, which of course cannot answer the question because it does not have the capacity for human thought. This makes the interrogation ridiculous, and thus, funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is asking the shark a question that is impossible for it to answer. It's impossible for the shark to remember what it had for lunch last Thursday because, as a fish, it doesn't have a memory like humans do. The cop is using a common interrogation tactic (asking a question that can't be answered in order to get information) on an creature that can't answer the question, which is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because interrogating a shark about a crime is absurd. The shark will almost certainly not remember what he had for lunch last Thursday, because he has no concept of time, but even if he did, it's unlikely that he would be able to communicate that to the police officers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "do you remember what you did last night?", which is often used as an accusation in police interrogations. In this case, the joke is that the shark can't remember what he did last Thursday because he was probably out of water and thus died.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in order to remember what he had for lunch last Thursday, the shark would have to be able to survive out of water for that amount of time, which, as we know, is not possible. The cop is using a line of questioning that is meant to trip up the shark and show that he is not the one who killed the person in the photo, because the shark couldn't have done it if he can't even survive out of water for a day.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is questioning the shark about a crime, and his line of questioning is absurd. He's trying to get the shark to remember what it ate for lunch last Thursday, as if that would have any bearing on the case. This is silly because, not only is it unlikely that the shark would remember what it ate that long ago, but even if it did, it's not clear how that would be relevant to the case.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="86.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="88.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
