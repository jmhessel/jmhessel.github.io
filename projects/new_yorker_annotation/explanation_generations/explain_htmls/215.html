In that story, Moses is given the Ten Commandments by God, who comes down from the clouds. In this scene, the man is presumably Moses, and he is being given a sweater by the hand of God. The joke is clever because it is a pun on the phrase "act of God," which is often used to describe natural disasters that are beyond human control.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the story of Moses receiving the Ten Commandments from God. In that story, God appears to Moses in the form of a burning bush; in this situation, God appears in the form of a huge hand coming out of the clouds. The man in the picture is surprised, but not scared, by the hand. The joke is clever because it takes a well-known story and updates it with a modern twist.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The hand of God is giving Moses a jacket, which is an act of God. But "it gets chilly at night in the desert" is also a way of saying that things happen for a reason, or that there is a natural order to things. So, the joke is that the hand of God giving Moses a jacket makes sense because it's cold in the desert, but also because Things Happen for a Reason.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the picture is Moses, and the hand coming out of the clouds is God giving him the Ten Commandments. The man is worried because he's about to receive a huge responsibility, and he's also cold because he's in the desert. The joke pokes fun at how dry and uninteresting the story of the Ten Commandments can be.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it's understandable that God would give Moses a jacket to keep him warm in the desert, the fact that the jacket is very modern (and probably not available in Moses' time period) is unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "it gets chilly at night" can mean that the person is cold, or it can mean that the person is nervous/worried. In this case, the phrase is used in the latter sense, as Moses is worried about receiving the sweater from God. The joke is clever because it's a pun that uses two different meanings of the phrase.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of the Bible story, it is strange to see God giving Moses a sweater instead of the ten commandments. The joke is funnier if you imagine that God is actually trying to be helpful in giving Moses a sweater to keep him warm, but the contrast between the grandeur of the story and the mundane object being given makes it amusing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "it gets chilly" can mean that the temperature is becoming colder, or that the atmosphere is becoming more formal/unfriendly. In this case, the phrase is used in the latter sense, as it's implying that God is scolding Moses for being unprepared for the cold night. The joke is clever because it's a clever way to depict God as a caring, but also fussy, father-figure.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "it gets chilly at night in the desert" is commonly used to describe how one can prepare for cold weather. However, in this context, the phrase takes on a double meaning because the "chilly" weather is actually caused by the giant hand of God reaching down from the sky and giving Moses a sweater.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "chilly at night" can mean that the temperature is cold, or it can mean that someone is feeling nervous or anxious. In this case, both meanings are true: the temperature is cold at night in the desert, and Moses is feeling anxious about receiving the Commandments from God. The joke is clever because it uses the double meaning of the phrase to make a pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The hand of God giving Moses a jacket is an example of irony because Jackets are often associated with being cold, when in reality, they are worn to keep warm. The fact that it is God giving Moses the jacket makes the joke even funnier, because God is usually associated with being all-knowing and powerful, so He would know that jackets are worn to keep warm and not because it is cold outside.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the hand of God is giving Moses a jacket, implying that God is chilly. But, since God is omnipotent, he wouldn't actually need a jacket to keep warm. The joke is poking fun at the fact that even God can get cold sometimes.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the hand of God is giving Moses a modern-day jacket. The modern-day jacket is out of its time, and it's funny to think about Moses wearing a contemporary piece of clothing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it's true that it can get cold at night in the desert, it's unexpected that God would give Moses a sweater to wear. The joke could also be interpreted as God trying to be more relatable to Moses, by giving him a gift that a normal person would appreciate, rather than something grandiose like the ten commandments.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The turtleneck sweater that God is giving Moses is a way of saying that God is covering up/protecting Moses from the cold. But the joke is also funny because it's a very literal interpretation of the story: usually, when people say that God is giving someone a "turtleneck sweater", they mean that God is giving them protection or guidance, but in this case, God actually is giving Moses a sweater to keep him warm.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="214.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="216.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
