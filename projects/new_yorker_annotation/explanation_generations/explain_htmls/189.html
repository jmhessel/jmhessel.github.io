The joke plays on the fact that "bites" can be both literal (i.e., food) and figurative (i.e., criticism or comments).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is so far above the employee on the totem pole that the employee has to literally look up at him from the bottom of a staircase. The boss is so high up that he is impractical to approach, and the employee is suggesting that instead of coming up to the boss, the boss come down to their level to have a quick bite to eat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss's office is so over-the-top that it seems like he is a king or queen, rather than a CEO or manager. The suggestion that they go out for a "quick bite" is humorous because it is a very mundane suggestion, in contrast to the setting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the CEO is offering the man a chance to go get food, as if this is something that is available to everyone in the office. However, the man is so low down in the hierarchy in the office that he is practically invisible, and it's doubtful that the CEO knows who he is or would want to spend time with him outside of work.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is sitting on a throne and the employee is inviting him to go out and get something to eat. The boss is so far above the employee that it would be impossible for him to go with them, even if he wanted to.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a normal thing to say to a co-worker, but the fact that the boss is sitting on a throne makes it funny because it implies that the boss sees themselves as a king or queen who doesn't have time for a quick bite because they are too busy ruling.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is so far above the employee that the only way for the employee to speak to the boss is to shout up to them. The boss is so high up that they are effectively unreachable, and the employee is suggesting that they go out for food, implying that the boss is too high up to come down and eat with them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the size of the office and the casual way the boss invites the man to join him for lunch. It's as if the boss is so far above him, both literally and figuratively, that he doesn't even need to be formal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in most offices, the boss is usually the one who invites people to go out to lunch with them, not the other way around. However, in this case, the boss is so far above the employee on the stairs that it would be impossible for the employee to go to lunch with them without first climbing up the stairs. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: instead of going out for a "quick bite" of food, the employee is suggesting going out for a "quick bite" at the boss (i.e., to attack or harm the boss).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "quick bite" can mean either a meal that is eaten quickly, or a vampire bite. Since the office is so big and the man on the dais is talking down to the other man, it's implied that he is the CEO or some other high-ranking authority figure. The joke is that he might be a vampire, and he's inviting the other man to join him for a meal of blood.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in most cases, when an employer invites an employee to join them for a meal, it's a way to build rapport or show appreciation. However, in this case, the employer is so far above the employee, both in terms of physical height and in terms of power, that the invitation feels more like a command than a friendly offer.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the dais is the CEO of the company, and he's offering the other man, who is probably an employee, to join him and some other people for a meal. The joke is clever because it's a play on words; "quick bite" can mean both a meal that is eaten quickly, and also a small amount of money. In this case, the CEO is offering the employee a meal, but is also implying that he will only be able to afford a small or inexpensive meal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The boss is sitting on a throne-like chair at the top of a large staircase and the employee is at the bottom of the stairs. The boss is offering the employee the chance to come with them to get a quick bite to eat, but the employee is probably not going to want to walk all the way up the stairs just to eat a quick bite.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is sitting on a throne-like chair and the employee is inviting him to come eat with them. The contrast between the casual activity of going out to eat and the formal setting of the throne room makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the scene: the man is so small in comparison to his office, and the other man is so far away on a raised platform, that the idea of them going out to lunch together is absurd.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
