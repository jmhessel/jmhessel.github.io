If she dropped some weight, she would be thinner and would thus have a smaller chance of being able to stop the cement block from hitting her. However, if she remained the same weight, she would be more likely to be able to stop the block.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's ex-wife is about to be hit by a cement block, and instead of being worried about her safety, he is joking about her weight. The situation is made even funnier by the fact that the man's current wife is sitting right next to him and is completely unaware of the impending danger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's reaction to the cinderblock about to hit his head is to nonchalantly say something that would usually not be considered an appropriate thing to say in that situation. Instead of showing concern for his safety or yelling out a warning, he makes a joke about his ex-girlfriend's weight. It's unexpected and inappropriate, which makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non-sequitur: the speaker is talking about his ex-wife, and how he would take her back if she lost some weight, but the situation is that a cement block is falling from the ceiling. The joke works because the two things, the ex-wife and the cement block, are both heavy, and dropping some weight is a way of making something lighter.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of the situation, the speaker is saying that he would take his ex-girlfriend back if she dropped some weight, but what he really means is that he would take her back if she dropped the cinder block that is about to fall on his head. The joke is a play on words, where the phrase "dropping some weight" is used to mean both "losing some weight" and "letting go of something heavy."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's nonchalant reaction to the impending danger contrasts with the gravity of the situation. Instead of paying attention to the potential threat, he makes a joke about his ex-wife, indicating that he doesn't view the current situation as serious.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is implying that he'll only take his ex-girlfriend back if she drops something (i.e., the cinder block that's about to fall on her head), but the other meaning of "drop" is to lose weight, which is what the man is really saying.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity between the situation (a man about to be crushed by a falling cinder block) and the nonchalant comment made by his friend. Instead of being worried about his friend's safety, the man is more concerned with his friend's appearance, and making a joke about it. This dark humor contrasts sharply with the danger of the situation, making it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of the situation, the man's ex-wife would be in danger if she attempted to catch the cement block that was falling towards her. The man's comment about his ex needing to "drop some weight" is a pun on the fact that, if she dropped some weight, she would be able to catch the block and save herself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's nonchalant response to the impending danger he's in is unexpected. Most people would be panicking if they were about to be hit by a falling object, but this man is more concerned with his ex-girlfriend's weight. This indifference to danger is unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is willing to take his ex-girlfriend back if she drops some weight, but he's oblivious to the fact that a cinder block is about to drop on her head, which could kill her. This showcases how superficial the man's reasons for taking her back are, and how he's more concerned with her appearance than her safety.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man says he'll take his ex back "if she drops some weight," but in this situation, his ex is the cinderblock that is about to fall on him. So, he literally needs her to "drop some weight" in order to save him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is an example of a non-sequitur: the two men are having a conversation about one thing (a cement block falling from the ceiling) when the subject suddenly changes to another thing (a man's ex-girlfriend) without any logical connection between the two. This can be funny because it is unexpected and creates a disorienting effect for the listener.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it is common for people to joke about their significant other needing to drop some weight, the man in this situation is actually in danger of being killed by a cinder block dropping on his head. The contrast between the casual way he talks about his ex and the dangerous situation he's in is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non sequitur: the two topics, breakfast and falling masonry, are completely unrelated. The man's ex-girlfriend losing weight is probably something that he's been wanting for a long time, and his use of the falling masonry as a way to get her to do it is absurd.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="188.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="190.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
