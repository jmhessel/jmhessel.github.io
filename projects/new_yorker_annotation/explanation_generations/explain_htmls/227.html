I just enforce them.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The police officer is telling the driver that he is not responsible for the laws of physics, which state that a police car cannot catch a rocket. The officer is only responsible for enforcing the law, not making them. This joke is a clever way of saying that the driver should have known better than to try and outrun the police in a rocket.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The policeman is explaining to the driver that he is not responsible for the fact that the rocket he was driving caught fire, but is merely enforcing the law that says the driver must pay a fine for the infraction. This is a play on the fact that the police enforce the laws of the land, not the laws of physics.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the policeman is telling the rocket driver that he isn't the one who makes the laws of physics, which is why the rocket driver is getting a ticket. The joke is clever because it's true: the policeman isn't the one who makes the laws, but he is the one who enforces them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The policeman is giving the driver a ticket for breaking the law, but the driver has also broken the laws of physics. The joke is clever because it's true: the policeman is not responsible for the laws of physics, he just enforces the law.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The police officer is saying that he can't help that the laws of physics (i.e., that things like jets can't stop on a dime) are being violated, he's just doing his job by enforcing them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the policeman is ticketing the driver for breaking the law of physics, specifically the law of conservation of momentum. The joke makes light of the fact that the driver is breaking the law, by suggesting that the policeman is equally powerless to do anything about it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, of course, the cop is not actually responsible for the laws of physics --- he is just enforcing the rules of the road. The fact that he is ticketing a rocket for breaking the rules of the road is absurd, but the cop is just doing his job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the policeman is telling the driver that he didn't make the laws of physics, which is the reason why the driver got a ticket. He's just enforcing them. This is a clever way of saying that the driver should have known better, and is thus responsible for his own ticket.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The cop is saying that he doesn't make the laws (of physics), he just enforces them. This is a clever way of saying that he's just doing his job, and he can't help that the driver is breaking the law.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "I don't make the laws of physics, sir," can be interpreted two ways: 1) the police officer is telling the pilot that he did not make the law that says you cannot land a jet in the middle of the street and 2) the police officer is telling the pilot that he does not make the laws of physics, he just enforces them. The latter interpretation is funnier because it implies that the police officer has the power to enforce the laws of physics, which is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The policeman is saying that he isn't responsible for the fact that the driver was breaking the law by flying a rocket; he's just doing his job by enforcing the law. Of course, the driver is breaking the law of physics by flying a rocket, but the policeman is pretending not to know that.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, of course, the police officer isn't pulling the jet over because he is violating the law of physics --- that would be impossible. The joke is playfully mocking the authority that police officers often have, suggesting that they are above the laws that they are meant to uphold.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police officer is just doing his job in ticketing the rocket, even though it's clear that the rocket is breaking the law of physics by driving on the road. The joke is clever because it's a play on the common phrase "I don't make the rules, I just enforce them."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun. The phrase "laws of physics" typically refers to the scientific laws that govern the behavior of matter and energy. However, in this context, the phrase "laws of physics" can also refer to the physical laws that govern the behavior of objects in the world, such as the law of gravity. The joke is clever because it is a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because police officers often give people tickets for breaking the law, even if they don't agree with the law. In this case, the officer is giving a rocket a ticket for breaking the law of physics --- that is, for flying instead of staying on the ground.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="226.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="228.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
