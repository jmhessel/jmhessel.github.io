The alligator is so big that it would be impossible to put it back in the receiver, so the man is using it as a speakerphone. The joke is also funny because the man is ordering a six-foot baguette, which is an absurdly large sandwich.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person's reaction to finding a dead alligator on their desk is surprisingly calm. They are more concerned about their lunch plans than the fact that there is a dead alligator in their office. The joke is also funny because of the contrast between the dead alligator (something large and dangerous) and the six-foot baguette (something small and innocuous).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The person sees the alligator on the desk and says that their lunch date (with a crocodile) needs to be canceled, and they would instead like a six-foot baguette. The alligator/crocodile is a play on the word "cancel," as in to cancel a plans, and the baguette is a play on the word "date," as in a romantic lunch date.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the reaction to finding a dead alligator in one's office is usually shock/disgust, but in this case, the person is more concerned with cancelling their lunch date and getting a six-foot baguette. The nonchalance with which the person handles the alligator emphasizes the absurdity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is surprised to see a dead alligator on the desk, and the man's response is to ask her to get him a six-foot baguette. The contrast between the dead alligator (something that is potentially dangerous/scary) and the baguette (something that is mundane/everyday) is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the alligator on the desk is so unexpected that the man's reaction is to simply ignore it and carry on with his day as if nothing is wrong. He wants a baguette because it is a long, thin bread, which could possibly be used to lure the alligator away.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that alligators and crocodiles are often seen as dangerous predators. In contrast, the man in the office is nonchalantly using the alligator as a place to rest his lunch, as if it's no big deal. The joke is also a play on the fact that alligators are often associated with Louisiana, which is known for its French influence and cuisine, including baguettes.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non-sequitur. The person who walked in is surprised to see the alligator, and the joke-teller is telling the person to forget about their lunch date and instead get them a six-foot baguette. The joke is funny because it is unexpected and unrelated to the alligator.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the alligator on the desk is so large that it would take a very long time to eat, and the speaker would rather have a six-foot baguette, which is a lot of bread, to eat instead. This suggests that the alligator is not only a nuisance, but also a hindrance to the speaker's work day.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the man's casual attitude towards the alligator on his desk and the reality of the situation, which is that there is a dangerous animal in close proximity to him. The joke is also funny because it playfully exaggerates the size of the alligator, making it six-feet long, when in reality, alligators only grow to be about 15 feet long.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's reaction to the alligator is more concerned with her lunch than with the fact that there is a dead alligator on the table. This is unexpected because usually, finding a dead alligator would be shocking and would warrant a more extreme reaction than simply cancelling a lunch date.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's reaction to the alligator is to ask the man to get her a six-foot long baguette, as if the alligator is not even there. The joke is clever because it is a play on the phrase "Crocodile Dundee", in which the protagonist is unphased by most things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is telling his coworker to cancel his lunch date, implying that he has something more important to do: namely, order a large baguette to feed the alligator on his desk. The alligator is likely to be very hungry, and so the man needs to get a lot of food to satisfy its appetite.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who walks in and sees the alligator is more concerned with getting food than with the dead alligator on the desk. This is a play on the phrase "crocodile tears," which refers to false or insincere displays of emotion, usually sadness. In this case, the person is not legitimately upset about the alligator, but is more upset about the fact that they won't have lunch.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the scene: someone has a dead alligator on their desk, which is a very strange and unexpected thing to see. The person's response is to make a joke about wanting a sandwich, which is a very normal thing to want. The contrast between the two elements is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
