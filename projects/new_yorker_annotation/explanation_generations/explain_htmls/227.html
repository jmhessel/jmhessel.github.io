The first part of the joke implies that the lifeguard tower is so tall because God needed a part-time job and this is the result of his work. The second part of the joke is a pun on the phrase "God-forsaken," meaning an abandoned place that is remote or unpleasant, often used to describe beaches. The joke is clever because the beach is not actually God-forsaken, but rather the opposite, since God apparently worked there.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it suggests that the lifeguard tower is so tall because it was built by God. This is absurd because, while God is often associated with being very powerful, he is not usually associated with needing a part-time job, let alone one that would involve building a lifeguard tower. The joke is also funny because it suggests that even God needs a job to make ends meet, which is contrary to the common conception of him as all-powerful and all-knowing.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="226.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="228.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
