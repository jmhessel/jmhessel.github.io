The word "deployed" can mean two things: to deploy a parachute, or to unroll a ring of fabric around someone's neck to protect their clothes from getting dirty. In this case, the woman's collar deployed, or unrolled, when her carriage rear-ended an ox cart. This would be an unusual situation because carriages typically don't rear-end ox carts, and if they did, the collision would not be hard enough to deploy a parachute.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's ridiculously large collar (known as a ruff) deployed, or popped up, when her carriage rear-ended an ox cart. The joke is poking fun at the formality of the Victorian era, where even a small accident could lead to your clothes being ruined.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman's "ruff" (a kind of frill on a dress) deployed when her carriage "rear-ended" an ox cart. This situation is unlikely because usually carriages don't rear-end ox carts; it's more likely that the ox cart would rear-end the carriage. The joke is funny because it's a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "deployed" can mean to unfurl or to release, like a parachute. In this case, the woman's ruff (a neck frill on a dress) deployed, or unfurled, when her carriage rear-ended an ox cart. The image of the frill deployed is comical.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman's "frill" is actually a neck brace, which is a medical device used to support the neck. The joke is clever because it sounds like the frill is a part of her dress, but is actually something else entirely.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity between the formality of the Victorian clothing and the ridiculousness of the situation: a woman's ruff, a type of collar worn during the time period for formal occasions, deployed, or opened up, when her carriage hit an ox cart. The joke is clever because it uses the homophone "rear-ended" in a literal sense, which creates the humorous effect.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it assumes that the only reason the woman would have such an absurdly large dress ruffle is because it deployed in an accident. The joke is clever because it plays off the double meaning of "deploy": one meaning is to open up, as in the frill deploys when it is put on; the other meaning is to deploy something in a military sense, as in deploying a parachute.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the frill is so large and out of proportion to the woman's body that it's comical. The explaination for how the frill got to be that size is also funny because it's a play on the phrase "rear-ended," which usually refers to a car accident, but in this case is a literal description of what happened.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "frill" is actually a neck brace, which is a medical device that is worn to support and stabilize the neck. The joke is that the woman's neck brace deployed (opened up) when her carriage rear-ended an ox cart.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "frill" around the woman's neck is actually a ruff, which is a type of collar worn in the 16th and 17th centuries. The joke is that the woman's ruff deployed, like an emergency airbag, when her carriage collided with an ox cart. This is funny because it's a imagine a situation in which a woman from a different era would need an emergency airbag.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's ridiculously large collar deploys (opens up) in the event of a car accident, which would be unexpected and humorous. The joke is also clever because it uses a play on words: the woman's "carriage" (i.e. mode of transportation) rear-ended an "ox cart" (i.e. another mode of transportation), which is how the joke relates the two seemingly disparate objects.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman's "collar" deployed when her carriage rear-ended an ox cart. The word "collar" can mean a piece of clothing that goes around the neck, or it can mean a device that is used to arrest someone. So, the joke is that the woman's arrest device deployed when her carriage had an accident.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "deployed" here is a homonym for the verb meaning to unfurl or to release, as in "to deploy a parachute." However, in this case, the joke is referring to the physical deployment of the lady's ruff, which happened when her carriage hit an ox cart. The double meaning of "deployed" is what makes this joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "huge collar" around the woman's neck is called a ruff. A ruff is a type of clothing worn in the Victorian Era. The joke is that the woman's ruff deployed, or opened up, when her carriage rear-ended an ox cart. This is pun because the word "deploy" can also mean to unfold or open up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "deployed when" could mean either that the frill was part of a disguise that deployed when she was in an accident, or that the frill deployed as an inflatable device to protect her neck in the accident. However, given that the frill is so large and unwieldy, it's more likely that it was just a normal fashion accessory that deployed and became tangled in the accident.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="164.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="166.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
