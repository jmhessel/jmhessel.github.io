The Parthenon is an iconic ancient Greek temple that is significantly more grand and expensive than Stonehenge, which is a prehistoric monument made of large rocks.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Parthenon is a very famous, large, and complex Greek temple, whereas Stonehenge is a much smaller and simpler prehistoric monument. The joke is clever because it not only pokes fun at the client's unrealistic expectations, but also at the architects for trying to build something as complicated as the Parthenon on such a small budget.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the difference in budget between the two structures is so vast that it's impossible to build one on the budget of the other. The joke playfully exaggerates this impossibility by having the client want a much more elaborate structure than what they're willing to pay for.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the client wants an ambitious project to be completed, but doesn't want to spend very much money on it. This is a common complaint that architects have about their clients. The joke is also funny because the client wants a Parthenon, which is an ancient Greek temple, to be built on the budget of Stonehenge, which is an ancient British monument.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the saying "you get what you pay for." In this case, the people who commissioned the building got what they paid for, but it wasn't what they wanted. Instead of a Parthenon, they got a Stonehenge, which is (arguably) a less impressive structure. The joke is also funny because it's unexpected; one would not expect the Italians to try and build a Stonehenge.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Stonehenge is often thought of as being a very simple structure, when compared to the Parthenon, which is a much more complex and detailed building. The joke is clever because it playfully pokes at the client's unrealistic expectations while also being a very accurate description of Stonehenge.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man implies that the client (the person who hired them to build the Colosseum) wants an unrealistic and expensive project completed on a tight budget. The joke works because Stonehenge is a prehistoric monument in England that is much cheaper to visit than the Parthenon, which is a temple in Greece.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Parthenon is a much grander, more expensive structure than Stonehenge. The joke is also a play on words, because the word "parthenon" can also mean a "temple dedicated to the Virgin Mary." So, the joke could also be interpreted to mean that the client wants a grand temple, but is only willing to pay for a much cheaper, less impressive structure.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Parthenon is a famous ancient Greek temple that is in ruins, while Stonehenge is a more famous ancient British structure that is also in ruins. However, the Parthenon is generally considered to be a much more impressive structure, so the joke is that the client wants something as impressive as the Parthenon, but is only willing to pay the budget of Stonehenge, which is much less.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is true to life; often, clients or customers want something that is much more grand or complex than what they are willing to pay for. In this case, the joke is that the client wants a Colosseum, which is a very complicated structure, but they only want to pay the price of Stonehenge, which is a much simpler structure.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The term "Parthenon" is a type of Greek temple, which is famous for being very ornate and expensive. Meanwhile, "Stonehenge" is a prehistoric monument that is much more humble in appearance. The joke is clever because it takes two things that are seemingly unrelated (ancient Greek temples and Stonehenge) and makes a pun out of them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The client wants a Parthenon, which is a grand and expensive structure, but they only want to pay for Stonehenge, which is much cheaper. The joke is also funny because it's a common complaint that clients always want more than they are willing to pay for.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The architects were given a Stonehenge budget, but they built a Parthenon instead. The Parthenon is a very famous and iconic ancient Greek temple, while Stonehenge is a much more modest stone structure. The joke is clever because it is a play on words that is also a commentary on the unrealistic expectations of some clients.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Parthenon is an ancient Greek temple that is considered one of the most impressive feats of architecture, while Stonehenge is a more modest prehistoric structure. The joke is clever because it uses the word "parthenon" as a stand-in for "parthenon budget," which is a more expensive budget.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the architects are talking about how their client wants a grandiose structure like the Parthenon, but only wants to pay the budget of Stonehenge. The joke is a play on words because Parthenon is a much more famous (and thus, expensive) structure than Stonehenge.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
