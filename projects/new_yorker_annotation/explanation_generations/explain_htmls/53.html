It's as if the woman playing the organ is trying to heat up the church with the radiator. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the word "screen" can mean to test or to protect, and in this context, the organ is being screened (or tested) to see if it's good enough to be donated.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The organ in the church is a pipe organ, which is a type of musical instrument that uses air to produce sound. The joke is that the organ donor is not a person who has given their organs to be used in the church, but rather, a person who has given their organs to be used in the pipe organ. The joke is clever because it's a subtle play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a double entendre. An organ donor is someone who donates an organ, typically after they die, so that someone else can have a transplant. In this case, the woman is playing the organ, which is also a type of organ, just not the kind that can be transplanted. The joke is that the radiator is so big that it must have come from a very large person, and thus, the church should be more selective in who they allow to donate organs to them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "screen" can mean to select carefully (as in, to screen potential organ donors) or to shield from view (as in, to put a screen in front of the organ to protect the player from the heat coming off the radiator). In this case, the joke is that the organ player has been selected so poorly that he's been put in danger by being placed in front of the radiator.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the radiator is so big that it is clearly not meant to be there, and must have been brought in by the organ donor. This is a play on words because "screen" can mean either to protect or to vet someone or something beforehand.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The organ in the church is a musical instrument, but the priest is referring to the radiator, which is an object that produces heat. The joke is clever because it is a subtle way to make fun of the church and its donors.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "screen" can mean to test for compatibility, as in blood type compatibility for organ donation, but it can also mean a protective barrier. In this case, the joke is suggesting that the organ donor was not properly screened and as a result, the organ is too big for the church.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the radiator is far too large to be an organ, making it clear that the woman playing the organ is not a professional musician. The joke is a play on words, as the word "organ" can refer to both a musical instrument and a body part.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the object on top of the organ is a radiator, which is an object that is typically found indoors, attached to a heating system. It's out of place in the church, and it's much too big. The joke is clever because it makes a pun on the word "organ": the woman is playing an organ (a musical instrument) and there is an organ (a radiator) on top of it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the word " screen" can have multiple meanings. In this case, the word "screen" is being used in two different ways: the first meaning is that the priest wants the woman playing the organ to be screened for disease before being allowed to donate her organs to the church. The second meaning is that the priest wants the radiator to be screened (covered) so that it doesn't distract from the woman playing the organ. The double meaning of the word "screen" is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "organ" that the man is playing is a pipe organ, which is a type of musical instrument. The "organ" that the radiator fins are for is a human organ, specifically, the lungs. So, the joke is that the priest is saying that the pipe organ donor (the man playing the organ) is not suitable because he has radiator fins instead of lungs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The organ in the church is needs donors to give it money or resources, but the organ in the human body needs donors to give it blood or tissue. By saying that they need to screen their organ donors more closely, the speaker is implying that the people who have donated to the church are not up to par.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The organ the woman is playing is a musical instrument, whereas the radiator is a device for heating a room. The priest is saying that the person who donated the radiator must have been very large, given its size.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the radiator is so big that it dwarfs the organ, and it's not clear how it got there. The organ is a musical instrument that is typically played in churches, so the joke is implying that the radiator was donated by someone who thought it would be a good idea to put it in the church. However, the radiator is much too big and out of place, so the joke is that the person who donated it was not thinking clearly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "screen" can mean to test or check for something (like when you "screen" blood donors) or it can mean a physical barrier (like when you "screen" a window). In this case, the word "screen" is being used in both senses: the church needs to check their organ donors more closely to make sure they aren't criminals, and they also need to put a physical screen in front of the organ pipes to keep the radiator fins from being blown around.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="52.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="54.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
