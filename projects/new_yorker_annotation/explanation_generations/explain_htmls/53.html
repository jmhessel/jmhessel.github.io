In this case, instead of a pulse, the doctor is referring to the patient's cholesterol. The joke is clever because it's a play on words, and it's also a bit of a jab at how serious a high cholesterol level is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is making a pun about the large hand that has come into his office.

The doctor is talking to the hand, which is a common idiom meaning to talk to someone who is not present.
