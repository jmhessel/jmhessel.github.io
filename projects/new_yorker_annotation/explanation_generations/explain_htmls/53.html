The "Fantastic Four" are a group of superheroes with superpowers, one of which is Stretch, who has the ability to stretch his body. The waiter in the scene has an unusually long arm, similar to how Stretch would have an unusually long body. The joke is that the waiter's long arm is a result of the recession, which has caused even superpowered beings like Stretch to lose their jobs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in the comics, the Fantastic Four are a team of superheroes with superpowers. One of the members, Mr. Fantastic, has the ability to stretch his body to great lengths. In this scenario, the waiter is using his Mr. Fantastic-like abilities to reach the food to the couple, likely because he is the only one working and the restaurant is short-staffed due to the recession.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter in this scene seems to have the superpower of being able to reach extremely far with his arm. This is a reference to the superhero team the Fantastic Four, who have different superpowers. In particular, one member of the team, Mr. Fantastic, has the power to stretch his body to extreme lengths. The joke is that even a superhero team can't escape the economic recession.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter's extremely long arm is a play on the superhero character Mr. Fantastic from the Fantastic Four, who has the ability to stretch his body. In this case, the waiter's long arm is a result of the need for social distancing, and the joke makes light of the fact that even superheros are not immune to the economic recession.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a reference to the Marvel Comics superhero team known as the Fantastic Four. One of the members of the team, Mister Fantastic, has the ability to stretch his body to extreme lengths. The joke is clever because it uses this superpower in the context of a recession: the waiter's elongated arm is a way to save money on food, by stretching one plate of food to feed multiple people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter's extremely long arm is a reference to the Marvel Comics character Mr. Fantastic, who is a member of the Fantastic Four. The joke is implying that even super-powered beings like Mr. Fantastic are not immune to the economic downturn, as he is now working as a waiter.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The Fantastic Four is a superhero group who have superpowers, one of which is a very long arm (like the waiter in this scene). However, even though they have superpowers, they are still feeling the negative effects of the recession, just like everyone else.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the comic book character Mr. Fantastic, who has the ability to stretch his body. In this joke, the chef is stretching his body to an extreme to bring the food to the customers, possibly because the restaurant is understaffed due to the recession.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the superhero team Fantastic Four, who are known for their superpowers. In this case, the waiter's very long arm is a result of his stretching power, which he is using to deliver the food to the customers while maintaining social distancing. However, the fact that he is doing this suggests that even superpowered beings are not immune to the economic downturn, as they are being forced to take on jobs that they wouldn't normally do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "long arm of the law." The phrase usually means that the law will catch up to you eventually, but in this case, the long arm is that of the waiter, who is able to serve the customers from a distance. This is a clever way to comply with social distancing guidelines while still being able to serve customers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple at the restaurant is being served by Mr. Fantastic from the Fantastic Four, who is known for his ability to stretch his body. In this case, he is using his stretchy powers to save on labor costs by serving the food himself. However, even heroes like Mr. Fantastic are not immune to the negative effects of the recession.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Fantastic Four are a super-hero team whose members have super-powers. One of the members, Mr. Fantastic, has the ability to stretch his body to extreme lengths. In this situation, the recession has hit the restaurant industry so hard that even a superhero like Mr. Fantastic has to take on a job as a waiter. The joke is a play on the fact that even super-powered individuals can be affected by real-world problems.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to the character Mr. Fantastic from the Fantastic Four, who has the power to stretch his body. In the current economic recession, even he is feeling the financial pinch, as evidenced by the fact that he is now working as a waiter with an impossibly long arm.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to the comic book characters known as the Fantastic Four. One of the characters, Mr. Fantastic, has the ability to stretch his body to great lengths. The waiter in the scene is depicted with an extremely long arm, which is similar to Mr. Fantastic's ability. The joke is clever because it not only references the comic book character, but it also makes a joke about the current economic recession.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Fantastic Four are a superhero team whose powers include, among others, stretching their bodies to great lengths. The chef in this situation has a similar power, but is using it to save money by not hiring a waiter to bring the food to the customers.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="52.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="54.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
