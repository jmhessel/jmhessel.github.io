The word "copy" can mean to make an exact replica, or it can mean to make a duplicate of a document. In this case, the men are replicas of one another, so the woman on the phone is saying that there may be a problem in the room where they were made.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "copy room" is a room where you make copies, but it is also a room full of people who are clones. The woman on the phone is saying that there may be a problem in the copy room because there are so many clones there. This is a play on words because it is both a literal and figurative problem.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The copy room is where people make copies of documents, and it is also a room where there are now a dozen copy human beings. The woman on the phone is presumably calling someone to tell them about the problem, and the joke is that it is a problem that is both confusing and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The "copy room" is usually where people make copies of documents, but in this case, the copy room is where the clones are coming from. The woman on the phone is saying that there may be a problem with the clones, implying that there are too many of them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "copy" can mean to make an exact replica of something, as in copying a file on a computer, or it can refer to a room in an office where photocopiers and printers are kept. In this case, the copy room is where the men are being cloned, and the woman on the phone is shocked because there are now dozens of clones running around the office.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman on the phone is reacting as if there is a problem with the copy room, when in reality, the copy room is fine - it's the group of men that are clones of one another that is the problem. The joke is pun on the word "copy" where in one sense, it refers to the act of making an identical replica, and in another sense, it refers to a place where photocopies are made.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The copy room is where photocopies are made, but in this case, it is also where the clones are coming from. The woman's shocked reaction is also humorous, as it is a over-the-top reaction to what is happening.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman on the phone is saying that there may be a problem in the copy room because there are a bunch of clones coming in. This play on words is funny because it's a pun --- the copy room is usually where people make copies of documents, but in this case, the people in the copy room are making copies of people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman has just seen a large group of clones, which implies that something has gone wrong in the copy room. This is a play on words because the copy room is where people make copies of things, and it's also implied that the clones were made in the copy room. The joke is clever because it's a double meaning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's shocked reaction implies that she's never seen so many clones in one place before, and the fact that they're coming out of the copy room implies that they're all photocopies of the same person.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because there are too many copies of the same person. The woman is on the phone, probably calling someone to tell them about the situation, and says that they have a problem in the copy room. The copy room is where you make copies of documents, so the joke is that there are too many copies of the same person and they are flooding out of the room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "copy" can mean to make an exact duplicate, or it can mean to make a photocopy. In this case, the men are exact duplicates, so the woman is saying that there may be a problem in the room where they were made.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The copy room is where copies are made, and in this case, it is also where clones are made. The woman's reaction of shock implies that she does not know about the cloning program, and the joke is that she is surprised by the clones.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The room the men are walking into is called the "copy room," and the woman on the phone is saying that there may be a problem because they are all copies of each other. This is a pun because normally when something is copied, there is only one original and multiple copies. However, in this case, all the men are copies, which means there is no original.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "copy room": in an office, the copy room is often where people make copies of documents using a copy machine. However, in this case, the copy room is actually where the clones are being made. The woman on the phone is shocked because she's realized that there are dozens of clones running around the office, which is probably a problem.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="115.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="117.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
