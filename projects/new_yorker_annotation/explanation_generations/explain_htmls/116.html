The joke is clever because it could be interpreted in two ways: first, that the scientists are looking at the skeletons and trying to determine why they went extinct by looking at their skeletons, and second, that the scientists are looking at the skeletons and trying to determine why they went extinct by looking at their skeletons. In other words, the joke is clever because it isambiguous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's comment is implying that the dinosaurs became extinct because they were foolish enough to dress themselves up in silly costumes. The joke is a play on words, because the word "theory" can mean either a hunch or a scientific conjecture that has been supported by evidence. In this case, the man's "theory" is more of a hunch, and is not supported by evidence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is implied that the dinosaurs became extinct because they were too goofy, and the scientists' new theories support that idea. In reality, of course, dinosaurs became extinct because of a variety of reasons, including a meteor impact, but the idea that they might have just been too silly is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is based on the pun of "extinct." "Extinct" can mean two things: first, no longer existing, and second, a type of dance move popular in the early 20th century. In this case, the latter meaning is intended, as the dinosaur is dressed in a top hat and cane, which are accessories often used in extinct dances. The joke is that the dinosaur is no longer existent because it went extinct, i.e., the dance is no longer popular.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because often when scientists are discussing extinction, they are referring to natural causes like climate change or disease. However, in this case, the extinction is due to the dinosaurs dressing up in silly costumes, which is a much more human cause of extinction.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the scientists are standing near the dinosaurs in a museum, which means that the dinosaurs are extinct. The joke is poking fun at the idea that scientists don't really know everything, and that sometimes, their theories about why things happened are just theories. The fact that the dinosaurs are posed in a humorous way makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "theories" can refer to two different things: scientific theories about why something happened, or wild guesses. In this case, the person joking is making a wild guess (the dino's extinction is due to the fact that they are poor dressers) dressed up as a scientific theory.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The dinosaurs became extinct because they were unable to mate and produce offspring, but the joke suggests that the scientists have discovered a new theory that the dinosaurs became extinct because they were terrible at dancing. This theory is, of course, absurd, but it highlights the fact that the scientists still don't really know why the dinosaurs went extinct, despite all their research.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dancing dinosaurs suggest that they might have gone extinct due to their poor decision making. The scientists are saying that they have theories about why the dinosaurs went extinct, which are presumably better than the theory that they went extinct because they were bad dancers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the scientists are looking at the dinosaurs in a way that implies they are trying to determine how they could have possibly gone extinct. The joke is humorous because, even though we don't know definitively why dinosaurs went extinct, there are many theories, and the scientists might be way off in their thinking.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The scientists are talking about the dinosaurs' extinction, but the word "extinct" can also mean "no longer existing." The joke is that the scientists have new theories about why the dinosaurs are no longer existing, which is a clever way of saying that they don't know why the dinosaurs became extinct.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dinosaur is dressed up in a top hat and cane, which are typically associated with formal wear or dancing. This is unusual because it's not typically something one would expect to see on a dinosaur, let alone a fossilized one. The joke could be interpreted to mean that the researchers who found this dinosaur believe that the dinosaurs became extinct because they couldn't mate, due to their silly costumes.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is suggested that the dinosaurs became extinct due to their comical and out-of-place top hats and canes. The joke is a play on the fact that the dinosaurs actually became extinct due to a meteor hitting the earth, causing a global apocalypse. The top hats and canes are not likely to have had anything to do with their extinction.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dinosaurs are clearly not moving, so the scientists' comment about them having "promising new theories" about the dinosaurs' movements is ironic. It's also funny because it's a play on the common saying "we have some very promising new theories about why they became extinct," which refers to the dinosaurs' actual extinction 65 million years ago. In this case, the theories are about the more recent event of the dinosaurs' skeletons being put into a dancing pose.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the scientists are looking at the fossils of dinosaurs in a dancing pose. This could be interpreted as meaning that the scientists are looking at the fossils and trying to figure out why the dinosaurs became extinct. The joke is funny because it is unlikely that the dinosaurs became extinct because they were bad at dancing.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
