The matter-of-fact way he states this makes it funnier, as if it's a perfectly normal thing to do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that people usually wake up from a dream before they die in the dream. But in this case, the reverse is true --- the man wakes up after he's digested, implying that he was asleep the whole time he was in the whale. This is a silly and ironic way to die.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non sequitur. The man says that he usually wakes up at the point, which is when he and the other chef are inside the whale. The fact that he wakes up at that point implies that this situation is not usual, which is why it's funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the movie "Sleepy Hollow", in which a character is regularly beheaded in his sleep. In this situation, the chefs are being cooked inside the whale, and one of them jokes that he usually wakes up before this happens.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is impossible for chefs to be inside a whale. This is a play on the common dream/nightmare scenarios in which someone is falling or otherwise in danger, but wakes up before they are harmed. In this case, the chef cooks inside the whale regularly, but always wakes up before he is eaten.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the "I usually wake up at this point" line from the movie "Alien", which is about a creature that bursts out of a human's chest. In the movie, the character says this line after being alien has already burst out of his chest; in this context, the character says the line before the creature has had a chance to wake up, showing that he's not aware of the danger he's in.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "I usually wake up around this time," which is something people say when they want to signal that they are about to leave or need to go soon. In this case, the man wake up at the point in the whale's digestive process where it would be regurgitating them back up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to the common saying "I usually wake up at this point," which people often say right before they doze off. The joke is made funnier by the situation in which it is said: the speaker and his fellow chef are deep within the whale's digestive system, and it's unlikely that they will be able to escape or be rescued. The phrase takes on a new meaning in this context, as the speaker is saying that he usually wakes up (from being digested) at this point.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is saying that the current situation, being inside a whale, is not real and is just a dream. This is a play on the common saying "I usually wake up at this point," which is used to describe when someone becomes aware that they are in a dream.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "I usually wake up around this time." The normal meaning of this phrase is that someone wakes up at a certain time because that is when they usually wake up. In this case, the speaker woke up inside a whale, which is obviously not normal. The fact that the speaker is unphased by this and is just making a casual observation is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the speaker has been eaten by the whale before, and thus is familiar with the experience of waking up inside the whale's digestive system. This is a play on the common dream/fear of being eaten by a large creature.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is in a very surreal and dangerous situation: he's inside the whale, and would normally be digested and turned into whale food. The fact that he's a chef and is holding cooking supplies is also strange and funny. The joke is funny because it's a play on how people usually say they wake up "at the wrong point" in a dream, which is usually when they're in danger. In this case, the speaker is in danger, but he's joking that he's used to waking up at this point in his dream.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is impossible for chefs to be inside a whale, and they are clearly aware of this fact. The joke is also a play on the common cooking phrase "I usually wake up at this point," meaning that the chef has been cooking for so long that they are only now just waking up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is impossible for chefs to be inside a whale, and the fact that they are still alive implies that they are in some sort of dream or nightmare. The joke suggests that the dream is not a pleasant one, as the protagonist wakes up at the point when things usually get bad in a dream.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the speaker is inside a whale, and they are cooking, so they are making "wake-up calls" to the people who are sleeping. The fact that they are inside a whale is what makes it funny, because it's unexpected and absurd.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
