Then we discovered people really preferred brunch.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a play on the common idea that people who go on hikes or climb mountains are doing so in order to "find themselves" or achieve some sort of enlightenment. However, the people in this scene have given up on that idea and instead set up a brunch buffet because they realized that people just want to eat when they reach the top of the mountain.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it subverts the expectations of what one would find at the top of a mountain. Instead of a peaceful scene with a beautiful view, there is a busy restaurant serving brunch. This is a play on the idea that people often go to restaurants for the social scene and good food, rather than for enlightenment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common saying "enlighten me". In this case, the wise man at the top of the mountain is saying that they used to offer enlightenment to people who made the trek up, but they found that people preferred the more mundane offerings of a restaurant, like brunch. This is a clever way of satirizing the materialism of society.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Enlightenment" is often used to describe a spiritual or religious epiphany, while "brunch" is a meal typically eaten on weekends. The joke is that the people at the top of the mountain have realized that people would rather have a good meal than a religious experience.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Enlightenment" is a spiritual term meaning a state of spiritual knowledge or understanding. "Brunch" is a meal typically eaten around midday consisting of both breakfast and lunch items. So, the joke is that the people at the top of the mountain used to offer enlightenment to hikers, but then they realized that people would rather just have a good meal. This is clever because it highlights how some people seek spiritual knowledge for its own sake, while others are more interested in tangible rewards.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because people often go to restaurants on Sundays for brunch instead of going to church. The fact that there is a restaurant on top of a mountain is even funnier, because it's such an inaccessible location. The joke is also funny because it suggests that the people who run the restaurant are more interested in making money than in providing a spiritual service.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Enlightenment" is a spiritual term often associated with mountains (e.g., the common image of a guru meditating on top of a mountain). However, the joke replaces this with the more earthly/mundane concept of "brunch," i.e., a meal typically eaten on weekends. This reflects the view that people often seek out spiritual experiences for superficial reasons, rather than for any real inner change.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "enlightenment" the wise man is referring to is the spiritual kind, whereas the "brunch" is a type of meal. The joke is clever because it's pointing out how people often prefer material things (like food) over spiritual things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because enlightenment is a state of understanding or knowledge that is usually hard to achieve, and it's strange that the old man on the mountain top would be offering it as a menu item like it's a type of food. However, what's even stranger is that people would prefer the easier to obtain item of brunch, which is a type of meal, over enlightenment. The joke is clever because it's poking fun at the fact that people often prefer things that are easy to obtain or consume, even if they aren't as good for them, instead of things that are difficult to obtain or consume but are better for them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Enlightenment" is a state of greater understanding or knowledge, and it's also a common type of ceilings found in restaurants. "Brunch" is a combination of breakfast and lunch, and it's also a meal often served at restaurants. The old man sitting on the mountain top is saying that people used to come to them for enlightenment, but they stopped because people would rather have brunch instead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at the fact that people often go on hikes or climb mountains in order to find some sort of inner peace or higher understanding, but in reality, people are more likely to just be interested in getting a good meal at the end of it. The joke is also funny because it's unexpected: you would never expect to find a restaurant at the top of a mountain.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Enlightenment" can mean gaining a spiritual understanding or knowledge, but it can also mean becoming well-informed about something. In this case, the people at the top of the mountain decided that what people really wanted was a good meal (brunch) instead of enlightenment, and so they changed their offerings. The joke is clever because it's true that many people prefer a good meal over gaining knowledge.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because enlightenment, which is a great thing to achieve, is being brushed off in favor of something as mundane as brunch. This is funny because it's a reversal of what people typically value; here, instead of valuing peace of mind and self-improvement, the people value a leisurely meal. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words; "enlightenment" and "brunch" both start with the letter "e".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Enlightenment" refers to the state of being free from ignorance, but also can refer to a cross between light andenment, which is "brunch". The fact that the people at the top of the mountain are selling brunch instead of enlightenment is a clever play on the dual meaning of the word.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because enlightenment is a serious, intense, and often ethereal concept, while brunch is a casual, lighthearted meal. The joke is poking fun at the idea that people would rather have something that is easy and enjoyable, like brunch, over something that is difficult and requires work, like enlightenment.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="59.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="61.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
