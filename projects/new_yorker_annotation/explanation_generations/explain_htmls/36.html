No, I haven't read it yet.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of someone who has just been stabbed, the note is most likely a suicide note from the person who stabbed him. The fact that he is calmly talking on the phone and has yet to read it implies that he is more worried about etiquette than the potentially life-threatening injury he has just sustained.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who has been stabbed is more concerned with whether or not he has read the note left by his attacker than he is with the fact that he has been stabbed. This is silly because, in most cases, being stabbed would be considered a more pressing matter than reading a note.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who has been stabbed is more concerned with the note that his attacker left, than the actual stab wound. This is a play on the famous quote attributed to Martin Luther, "Here I stand, I can do no other," in response to being asked to recant his religious beliefs. In this case, the man stabbed in the back is similarly unwilling to read the note, presumably because it would implicate him in some way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has been stabbed in the back with a knife, but he is calm and cool about it. The fact that his wife stabbed him is humorous, because it's usually the other way around. The fact that he hasn't read the note yet is also funny, because it's an unusual thing to say in this situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who has been stabbed is more concerned with the etiquette of reading a note that was left for him by his attacker than he is with the fact that he has been stabbed. This is absurd because, in most cases, being stabbed would be considered a more dire situation than reading a note.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the cliché of a person being stabbed in the back. In this case, the person literally has a note stabbed into their back, which they haven't read yet. This suggests that the person who stabbed them wanted to leave a message, but the recipient of the message hasn't bothered to read it yet, which is a clever twist on the cliché.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has been stabbed in the back with a piece of paper, presumably by his wife. He is calmly talking on the phone and says that he hasn't read the note yet, even though it is right there. The joke is poking fun at the fact that people often don't take the time to read things that are right in front of them, even when those things are important.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The note stuck in the man's back with a knife is both a physical note and a pun on the word "note," as in a musical note. The stabbed man hasn't read the note yet because he's too busy talking on the phone, and so he doesn't know that his wife has left him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has just been stabbed in the back with a note attached, and yet, he casually says that he hasn't read it yet. The note presumably contains information about why his wife stabbed him, but he is more interested in talking on the phone than finding out why.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the situation the man is in. He is on the phone with someone and has a knife stabbed in his back. The person he is talking to is probably his wife or girlfriend. The fact that he hasn't read the note yet implies that he doesn't want to know what it says. The situation is made funnier by the fact that he is on the phone and the person he is talking to can't see what is going on.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has just been stabbed in the back and is still on the phone with the person who did it. He nonchalantly mentions that there's a note, presumably from his attacker, but has yet to read it. This is humorous because it's a play on the phrase "a knife in the back," which is often used figuratively to mean betrayal. In this case, the man has literal knife in his back, and yet, he is still talking to the person who did it as if nothing has happened.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is talking on the phone about his wife leaving him, but he has a knife stabbed in his back and he hasn't read the note she left him yet. The joke is implying that he is going to find out some bad news when he reads the note, and the contrast between his casual attitude on the phone and the potential severity of the situation is what makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who has been stabbed is more concerned with the note that his attacker left, than he is with the fact that he's been stabbed. He's so calm about the situation that he doesn't even realize that he's been stabbed until the other person on the phone mentions it. The fact that he's more concerned with the note than his own wellbeing is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has a knife in his back, yet he is still trying to act casual on the phone. The note presumably explains why the woman stabbed him, but he hasn't read it yet, adding to the comedic effect.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "note" can mean two things: a musical note, or a written message. In this situation, the man has been stabbed in the back with a knife, and there is a note written on the paper that is attached to the knife. The man says he hasn't read it yet, but the implication is that he will soon find out why his wife stabbed him in the back.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="35.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="37.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
