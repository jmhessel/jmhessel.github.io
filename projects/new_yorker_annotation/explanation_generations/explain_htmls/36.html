The joke is also a play on the TV show "Shark Tank", where entrepreneurs pitch their business ideas to a panel of wealthy investors. The joke is clever because it suggests that the counselor's "therapy" is actually a scheme to get money from his clients.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the large fish tank in the counselor's office is likely a reference to the popular TV show "Shark Tank". In the show, entrepreneurs make pitches to a panel of investors, who decide whether or not to invest in their business. The show is often tense and emotional, with participants trying to save their business ventures. In the context of marriage counseling, the joke suggests that the counselor is suggesting that the couple put their marriage up for inspection in a similarly tense and emotional way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "shark tank" is usually used to describe a place where startup companies pitch their business ideas to a panel of wealthy investors in order to get funding. In this case, the counselor is suggesting that the couple get in the tank with sharks as a way to work out their marital issues. This is obviously a terrible and dangerous idea, which is why it's funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist's solution to the couple's problem is to put a shark in the tank. This is a play on the popular television show "Shark Tank," in which entrepreneurs pitch their business ideas to a panel of wealthy investors, or "sharks." In the show, the sharks often tear apart the business ideas, and the therapist is suggesting that putting a shark in the tank will similarly force the couple to confront their issues.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man and woman's marriage is in trouble and the counselor has proposed a "shark tank" therapy, which is a play on the television show "Shark Tank" where people pitch their business ideas to a panel of wealthy investors. In this case, the panel of wealthy investors are sharks, and the man and woman are pitching their marriage idea to the sharks in the hopes that they will invest in their relationship.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "shark" is a homophone of "chekov," which is a type of theater where the playwright wrote plays that often had unexpected plot twists or solutions. In this case, the counselor's solution to the couple's marital problems is to have them sit in front of an empty fish tank, which is a play on the phrase "chekov's gun."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the popular television show, "Shark Tank," in which entrepreneurs present their business ideas to a panel of wealthy investors in the hopes of securing funding. In this case, the marriage counselor's "therapy" involves putting his clients in an empty fish tank, which is both dangerous and ineffective. The joke suggests that the counselor is more interested in being entertaining than actually helping his clients.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully implies that the counselor's proposed solution to the couple's marital problems is to put them in the tank with sharks. Sharks are predators that can be dangerous, and so being put in a tank with sharks would be a very extreme way to try to fix a relationship. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the name of the popular TV show, "Shark Tank," where entrepreneurs try to get investors to fund their business ventures.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while Shark Tank is a popular television show in which entrepreneurs pitch their business ideas to a panel of wealthy investors in the hopes of getting funding, it is an unusual solution to marriage counseling. The joke suggests that the counselor is suggesting that the couple put their marriage to the test by seeing if they can survive in a literal Shark Tank, with the sharks representing the challenges in their relationship.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the counselor's proposed solution to the couple's marital problems is to put them in a large fish tank with no fish, which is a dangerous and potentially deadly situation. This is a play on the TV show Shark Tank, where entrepreneurs pitches their business ideas to a panel of investors, who then decide whether or not to invest in the businesses. In this case, the counselor is pitching the idea of shark tank therapy to the couple, who are the investors, and it's up to them to decide whether or not to go through with it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the counseled couple's problem is that they are considering getting a divorce, and the counselor's solution is to put them in a room with a shark. The joke is linking the concept of "divorce" with the dangerous situation of being in a tank with a shark, suggesting that divorce is just as dangerous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The counselor is suggesting that the couple put their marriage "in the tank" by attending counseling, but the fact that the tank is empty of sharks suggests that the counselor's plan may not be as helpful as he thinks.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the show "Shark Tank" is a reality TV show where entrepreneurs pitch their business ideas to a panel of wealthy investors in the hopes of getting funding. However, in this case, the counselor is suggesting that the couple put their marriage on the line in a similar way, by putting it up for investment by strangers. The joke is clever because it playfully reverses the usual roles in "Shark Tank" by making the couple the entrepreneurs and the strangers the sharks.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it suggests that the counselor's barbaric solution to the couple's marital problems is to put them in the shark tank, with real sharks. The sharks would presumably eat one or both of them, which would effectively end their marriage. However, it's also possible that the counselor is simply suggesting that the couple's problems are so big that they seem insurmountable, like being in a shark tank.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the reality television show "Shark Tank" is a show where entrepreneurs pitch their business ideas to a panel of wealthy investors in the hopes of getting funding. However, the idea of using sharks as a form of marital therapy is absurd, and the fact that the counselor is suggesting it shows how desperate he is to help the couple.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="35.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="37.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
