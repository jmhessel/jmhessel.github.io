The implication is that the man is being punished for not wanting to work at his desk all day, which is a relatable sentiment for many office workers. The fact that he is being punished in such an archaic way is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is literally chained to his desk, which is an unusual sight in an office setting. The fact that he didn't want to be chained to his desk is a play on the common phrase "I didn't want to be chained to my desk," which is often used to describe the feeling of being stuck in a job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is locked up in a stockade, which is a type of punishment that involves confining someone in a public place. The fact that he is in a office building, and was presumably chained to his desk, makes the joke even funnier because it's a play on the common phrase " chained to his desk," which is used to describe someone who is stuck in a boring or tedious job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in stocks is being punished in an unusual way --- he's not being chained to his desk, but he's in stocks, which is more often associated with public humiliation and physical pain (being hit with rocks or vegetables, for example). The man probably didn't want to be chained to his desk, which is a more common punishment in the modern workplace, but he ended up in stocks anyway.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is literally chained to his desk, in a way that is much more extreme than the standard meaning of the phrase "chained to one's desk," which usually means working long hours with no break. The visual of the man in a stockade also makes the joke funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in stocks is literally chained to his desk, but the phrase "chained to his desk" is often used to describe someone who is stuck in a boring or tedious job. The man in this scene is literally stuck in a boring or tedious job, hence the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is literally chained to his desk in a way that is usually associated with prisoners. The fact that he is an office worker who is presumably chained to his desk because he didn't want to do his work is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in stocks is not actually being punished - he just doesn't want to be chained to his desk like everyone else in the office. The joke implies that the man in stocks is actually enjoying his situation because it means he doesn't have to work.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is literally chained to his desk, but the phrase "chained to his desk" is also a common way to describe someone who works long hours at a desk job with no opportunity for breaks or days off. The fact that the man is actually chained to his desk makes the joke even funnier, because it emphasizes how literal the phrase can be.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the stocks is literally chained to his desk, but the phrase "chained to his desk" is often used idiomatically to mean that someone is stuck in a job they don't like. The joke is clever because it takes the literal meaning of the phrase and applies it to the man in the stocks.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is saying that the reason the other office worker is in the stockade is because he didn't want to be chained to his desk.

So the office worker is literally chained to his desk, in addition to the figurative meaning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in stocks is literally chained to his desk, which is a severe punishment. However, the woman is casually walking into the building as if this is a normal occurrence, which suggests that maybe the man in stocks is there voluntarily because he doesn't want to be chained to his desk. This is a funny idea because it's usually the opposite: people are chained to their desks because they don't want to be free.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in stocks is usually there as a form of punishment, yet in this case, he chose to be there.
