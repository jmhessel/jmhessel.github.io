Additionally, the joke is a play on the common phrase "turn out the lights when you leave," which has a similar meaning to "get the lights on your way out." In this case, the justices telling the man to get the lights on his way out would mean for him to leave the courtroom.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is speaking to the Supreme Court, which is the highest court in the United States, and is thus expected to be a very serious and formal occasion. However, the justices are all in bed, which is not only unexpected but also unprofessional. The joke is made funnier by the fact that the man is telling the justices to turn the lights off on their way out, implying that they are not only unprofessional but also lazy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is speaking to the Supreme Court, which is supposed to be a very serious and dignified institution. But the justices are lying in bed, which makes them look unprofessional and comedic. The joke is also a play on the phrase "on your way out," meaning "when you leave." In this case, the man is telling the justices to literally turn the lights off on their way out.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of the word "lights": in a normal scenario, when someone leaves a room, they might turn off the lights; however, in this context, the word "lights" is a reference to the naked people in the beds, i.e., body parts that are typically covered by clothing. Thus, the person at the podium is being asked to turn on the (naked) body parts of the people in the beds as he leaves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Supreme Court is a very serious and respected institution, but in this scene they are all in bed, which is not a serious or respectful place. The joke is also funny because the man who is speaking to them is already leaving, so the justices' request for him to turn off the lights is fairly pointless.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In the context of a courtroom, the "lights" refers to the electric lights in the room. However, in the context of the naked politicians in bed, the "lights" refers to the men's genitals. The joke is clever because it's a pun on the two different meanings of the word "lights."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the phrase "sleeping with the lights on." The phrase "sleeping with the lights on" is often used to describe people who are doing something they're not supposed to be doing (like sleeping with someone they're not married to). In this case, the men are naked in bed together, which is usually not something that would be done in public, so they are effectively "sleeping with the lights on." The fact that there are a bunch of politicians involved makes the joke even funnier, because it implies that they are engaging in corrupt activities.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it uses the fact that the justices are sleeping in beds to make a pun on the Supreme Court's common vote of 5-4. In this joke, the speaker is saying that if the man who is testifying leaves, they would like him to turn off the lights, implying that the majority of the court (five justices) would like him to leave.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is asking the person to leave the room, but is using a common idiom ("turn out the lights") in a very literal way. The fact that the justices are all in bed also adds to the humor, as it makes their request more difficult to fulfill.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in a courtroom, you would expect the lawmakers to be attentive to the speaker and to be engaged in the legislative process. Instead, they are asleep, which implies they are not taking their job seriously. The joke is a play on the common phrase "on your way out," which is usually said to someone who is leaving, but in this case, it's said to the speaker, implying that the lawmakers want the speaker to leave so they can continue sleeping.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the five justices who agree with the man's position on the issue would like him to turn the lights off as he leaves, so that they can go to sleep. The joke pokes fun at the idea that the justices might fall asleep during hearings, which is not an uncommon occurrence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "a majority rule," which is when more than half of the people in a group agree on something. In this instance, the majority of people are asleep, so they are not paying attention to what the speaker is saying. The person speaking is asking them to get the lights on their way out, which is something that a janitor or maintenance worker would say, not a government official. The joke is clever because it's a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it uses the idiom "five to four" to mean "the majority" in a way that is clever but also nonsensical. In this context, the joke is saying that the majority of the justices would like the man to leave so they can go back to sleep. The joke is also funny because it is unexpected that the justices would be in bed during a hearing. Finally, the joke could also be interpreted as saying that the justices are so tired that they can't even be bothered to get out of bed to hear what the man has to say.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is speaking is doing so in a formal setting, but the justices are in bed, which is informal. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the Supreme Court's voting system; if the justices were to vote on the man's request, it would be a five-to-four vote. However, in this case, the five justices who would vote in favor are telling the man to leave, while the four justices who would vote against are telling him to stay.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The light switch is usually on the way out of a room, so the speaker is telling the person to leave and turn the lights off. However, in this context, the lights are already on, so the speaker is telling the person to leave and turn the lights off, which is the opposite of what is usually meant. The joke is clever because it's a reversal of the expected situation.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
