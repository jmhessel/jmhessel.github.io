Three bottled waters, two sodas, one coffee, and six straws.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the standard "I got that" response, which is used to confirm that someone understood what was said to them. In this case, the man walking on the beach is confirming an order for drinks, but the fact that he is the only one not buried in sand implies that he is the only one who will be able to drink the beverages. This is a joke about a situation where someone is in a very difficult/precarious position, but still has to complete a mundane task.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is ordering drinks for the people who are buried in the sand, but he's also asking them to hold their breath underwater. The fact that he's ordering six straws is also a clue that he's not just ordering drinks, but telling them to hold their breath, as they will need straws to breathe through.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the swimsuit is talking to the people buried in the sand, who can only hear him but can't see him. He's asking them to get him drinks from the beach stand, but his instructions are confusing because he's referring to the people buried in the sand as if they were straws.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is not buried in the sand is clearly the leader of some sort, and he is delegating tasks to the others who are buried. He is telling them to go get drinks for everyone, and he specifies the types and number of drinks, implying that they will be able to remember and fulfill his request despite being buried in the sand. This is silly because it's hard to imagine how they would be able to do this.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person buried in the sand is ordering drinks as if this is a normal occurrence and the person who is not buried is just taking the order. This is absurd because, usually, people who are buried up to their heads would be struggling to breathe, let alone be ordering drinks. The joke is made funnier by the fact that the person taking the order is just matter-of-factly going through it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a very specific order for drinks, which is out of place given the chaotic scene. It's also funny because the person who is giving the order is the only one who isn't buried, and thus he is the only one who will be able to drink the beverages.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is not buried in the sand is giving very specific directions to someone who is buried in the sand. He is clearly in a position of power and is using it to take advantage of the other person. The other person is powerless to stop him or to get away, so they have to do as they're told.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the man is in a very precarious and dangerous situation, he is still trying to get work done, and is delegating tasks to other people who are in the same situation. The contrast between the man's serious demeanor and the absurd situation he's in is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is the only one not buried in the sand, and thus he is the only one who can get a drink. He is ordering six drinks for himself, which is a lot, and thus implies that he is very thirsty. The other people who are buried can't get drinks, which makes the situation more dire and thus funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is not buried in the sand is taking a drink order from the people who are buried. He is the only one who can move and reach the drink stand, so he is acting as their waiter. The joke is funny because it is a reversal of the typical situation, where the buried people would be the ones waiting on the man who is not buried.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is giving the order is clearly not in a position to be doing so: he is buried up to his head in the sand and is not in a position to see what is happening around him. Furthermore, the fact that he is ordering drinks for himself and five other people who are also buried in the sand is comical.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is not buried in sand is giving an order for food and drinks, as if this is a normal beach situation. The fact that the other people are buried in sand makes it clear that this is not a normal beach situation, which is why the joke is funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the swim trunks is talking on his phone, and he's ordering drinks for the people who are buried in the sand. He says "You got that? Three bottled water, two sodas, one coffee, and six straws." The joke is that the people in the sand are literally "straw men", and so the man is ordering drinks for them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man above ground is taking a drink order from the people who are buried in sand. The people who are buried can't see the drinks, so the man has to relay the order. This is difficult to do because he has to remember all of the different drink orders, and also because he has to keep track of how many straws to bring.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "you got that?" which is often said to people who are taking orders or doing something to make sure they understand. In this case, the man at the beach is talking to the buried people, who are literally stuck in the sand and cannot move. The joke is clever because it's a way of making fun of the fact that the buried people cannot do anything to get the drinks, even though they are probably hot and thirsty.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="227.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="229.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
