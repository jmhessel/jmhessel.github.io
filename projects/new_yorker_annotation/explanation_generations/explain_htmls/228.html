The joke is a play on the difference between "littering" (throwing trash on the ground) and "launching a rocket" ( launching a rocket into space).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common phrase "it takes two to tango." In this case, the police officer is accuse the pilot of a jet of illegally flying low over a field of popcorn, and the pilot is arguing that there's no way he could have been flying low because there's no way a jet could fit in that field.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the situation: a police officer is pull over a vehicle that is not usually pulled over, and the officer is making an assumption about why the pilot was going so fast. The joke is clever because it is based on the fact that "five acres" is a unit of measurement often used for farming popcorn, which is a type of corn. Thus, the officer is suggesting that the pilot was going so fast because they were trying to harvest their popcorn crop.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the policeman is ticketing the driver for littering, but the driver could have been doing much worse --- he could have been driving a rocket! The joke exaggerates the situation to make a point about how bad littering is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the policeman is giving the driver a ticket for speeding, but the driver is arguing that he wasn't speeding because he was just driving the speed limit. However, the fact that there is a rocket on the ground proves that the driver was definitely speeding, because there's no way a car could go that fast without breaking the law. The joke is a play on the phrase "the proof is in the pudding".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police officer is writing the driver a ticket for speeding, but the driver is arguing that he wasn't speeding because he was going so fast that he left a trail of popcorn behind him. The police officer is unimpressed and still writes the ticket.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the disparity in size between the jet and the police officer. The police officer is giving the jet a ticket, even though the jet is much larger than the police officer, and could easily squish him. The joke is also a play on the fact that people often eat popcorn at the movies, and the jet is like a giant movie screen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police officer is writing the driver a ticket for littering, but the driver clearly didn't do it --- the rocket did. The police officer is being sarcastic when he says that the five acres of popcorn is evidence that the driver was the one who littered.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the officer is issuing the driver a ticket for littering, and the driver has clearly just created a massive amount of litter (popcorn) by setting off a rocket. The officer's response implies that the driver was pretending he didn't know he set the rocket off, but the evidence is right there.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the policeman is writing a ticket for the driver for going too fast, but the driver denies it, saying that the rocket they were driving was only going five miles per hour. The policeman then says that the five acres of popcorn that the rocket blew up in the street is evidence that the driver was going faster than that. The joke is a play on the fact that popcorn pops when it is heated to a certain temperature, and the driver clearly exceeded that temperature, leading to the popcorn popping and blowing up the street.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the policeman is treating the situation as if the driver was speeding, when in reality, the driver was probably just going very fast because he was driving a rocket. The joke is a play on the phrase "by the skin of your teeth," which means to narrowly escape something. In this case, the driver has narrowly escaped a speeding ticket.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the policeman is writing the driver a ticket for littering, but the driver has a valid excuse: he was just littering five acres of popcorn back there. This is a silly excuse, but a plausible one given the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it's technically true that the cop could give the pilot a ticket for littering if there was a lot of popcorn left behind after the jet took off, it's highly unlikely that such a situation would arise. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the phrase "the proof is in the pudding," which means that the evidence of something is in the result. In this case, the "pudding" is popcorn.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "a loaded gun says you were," meaning that if someone has a gun on them, they were probably planning to use it. In this case, the five acres of popcorn is a reference to the movie "Jaws," in which a shark is eating people. The joke implies that the pilot was planning to eat the people in the street, and got pulled over before he could do so.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police officer is pulled over a jet for speeding, and the officer says that the jet was going so fast that the five acres of popcorn that the jet was carrying must have been caused by the jet's speed. This is a play on the phrase "you were going so fast, the lights must have caused the popcorn to pop," which is often said to people who speeding. The joke is clever because it's a play on words, and it's also a play on the situation, since usually, it's the other way around: lights cause popcorn to pop, not the other way around.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="227.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="229.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
