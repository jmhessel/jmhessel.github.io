The man in the suit is clearly not prepared for the beach, and is unaware that his suit is not appropriate beachwear.

The man walking in his suit is asking the lifeguard about what kind of fabric his suit is made out of, and whether or not it will be safe from sharks. The lifeguard's response is that it doesn't matter what kind of fabric the suit is made out of, because the sharks will still bite.
