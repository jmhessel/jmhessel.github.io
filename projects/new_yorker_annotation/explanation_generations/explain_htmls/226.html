Now give me the microphone.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the normally authoritative figure of the referee is being dwarfed by the two boxers. He's trying to maintain his composure and authority, but the situation is clearly comical. The joke implies that the referee is being overshadowed and is not the center of attention, which is usually the case.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the giants in the boxing ring. In most boxing rings, the fighters are of average size, so the refereee has a good view of the entire ring. However, in this ring, the giants are so large that the refereee is huddled between their legs, and can't see anything. The refereee is asking for the microphone, presumably so that he can better communicate with the fighters and give them instructions, but the joke is that he won't be able to see anything even if he has the microphone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the referee's reaction to one of the giant's joke implies that the giant is not supposed to be there. In this proverbial David and Goliath scenario, the giant is the one in the wrong, and the referee is putting a stop to his shenanigans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the giants in the ring are clearly not following the rules or expectations of a boxing match. The referee is trying to get control of the situation and get the microphone back from one of the giants, who is apparently using it to make jokes.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the ref is telling the boxers that their size difference is humorous, but then asks for the microphone, which would normally be used by commentators, not by the ref. This implies that the ref is actually the one who is supposed to be commentating on the fight, not the boxers themselves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the ref is saying that the size of the boxers is amusing, but he still needs the microphone so that he can do his job properly. The joke pokes fun at the situation by pointing out the inherent absurdity of it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the referee is telling one of the boxers that he's not being very funny, and then asks for the microphone. The implication is that the boxer was making a joke about being very big and strong, and the referee wants to confirm it by hearing the boxer say it himself into the microphone. The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the boxer is really big and strong, but he's not being "very funny" in the sense of being amusing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "microphone" can be shortened to "mic", and in this context, the word "mic" sounds like the word "mike", which is another word for "microphone". So, the joke is that the referee is telling the two boxers to hand over the microphone so that he can make an announcement.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the giants in the boxing ring are so big that they completely block out the referee, who is trying to announce the winner of the match. The idea of two giants boxing is funny in and of itself, but the joke is made funnier by the fact that the referee can't even be seen and has to ask one of the giants to give him the microphone so he can do his job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the referee is telling the giants that they are funny, but they need to give him the microphone back. The giants, who are much larger than the referee, may have taken the microphone to begin with to intimidate the referee or the other boxer.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two giant boxers in the ring are so big that their heads are almost at the level of the microphone the referee is holding. The referee is telling the boxers that their size is funny, but he still wants the microphone back so he can continue the fight.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the referee is not happy with the situation he's in, being surrounded by two much larger men. He's trying to keep order in the ring, but the joke is that he's not very successful at it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the referee, who is supposed to be the one in charge and in control, is asking for the microphone from one of the giants. This is a reversal of the expected roles, and it's humorous because it's an instance of someone acting out of character. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: "give me the microphone" can mean either hand over the physical microphone, or give me a turn to speak. In this case, the referee is asking for both.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the refereee is not 3 feet tall like in a traditional boxing match, but is instead tiny and insignificant in comparison to the giants. This refereee is not in control of the situation, and is asking to be given the microphone so that he can give instructions or perhaps start the match. However, the giants are not paying attention to him, and the joke implies that they will not give him the microphone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the referee is scolding one of the boxers for goofing around in the ring, and the boxer responds by trying to give the microphone back to the referee. However, the boxer is so large that the microphone is dwarfed in his hand, making it appear as if the boxer is trying to give the referee something much smaller than what he was originally holding.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="225.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="227.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
