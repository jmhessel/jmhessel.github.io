The officer already knows why he pulled him over (because he was speeding), but he's surprised by how he pulled him over (by catching his car with a rocket).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because police officers usually give a reason for why they pulled someone over when they give them a ticket. In this case, the officer is so perplexed by the situation that he can't even offer a reasonable explanation. The joke relys on the absurdity of the situation: a rocket is an unlikely vehicle to be pulled over by the police, so the officer's confusion is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The police officer is asking the pilot if they know why they were pulled over, but the officer is also asking if they know how they were pulled over, given that the officer is in a police car and the pilot is in a giant jet. The officer is also implying that the pilot may not know why they were pulled over, given that it's unlikely that the pilot has ever been pulled over before in their life.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to how police officers often ask drivers why they were speeding; in this case, the police officer has pulled over a driver who was speeding in a rocket. The joke is clever because it's a play on words; the officer is asking the driver both why he was speeding (because he was in a rocket) and how the officer caught him (because the police car has a rocket too).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the policeman is asking the driver a rhetorical question. He already knows why he pulled the driver over (for speeding), but he is also asking how he pulled the driver over, since the police car is still attached to the rocket. The joke is a play on words, since the policeman is asking how the driver was speeding, since he was going so fast that he was able to attach his car to a rocket.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "or how": the first meaning is a standard question a police officer would ask during a traffic stop, i.e., "Do you know why I pulled you over?" The second meaning is a question about the mode of transportation, i.e., "Do you know why I pulled you over, or how [I pulled you over]?" The fact that the police officer pulled over a giant jet in the middle of the street is surprising and makes the second meaning of the question humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The cop is asking the rocket driver if he knows why he was pulled over, which he does (because rockets don't belong on the road), but he's also asking if the rocket driver knows how he was pulled over. The cop, in a normal scenario, would have pulled the driver over with his police car, but in this scenario, the cop had to fly next to the rocket to stop it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop pulls over the rocket for a traffic violation and then proceeds to ask the rocket driver a rhetorical question. The question implies that the cop doesn't really know why he pulled the rocket over, or how the rocket is even driving in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it played on the double meaning of "over": the officer pulled the jet "over" to the side of the road, but he is also asking if the pilot knows "why" he was pulled "over" (i.e., why did I stop you?). In other words, the police officer is asking if the pilot knows why he (the police officer) pulled him (the pilot) over, or if the pilot knows how the police officer was able to stop a jet in the middle of the street.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is asking the rocket driver two different questions. The first question, "do you know why I pulled you over" is a standard police question meant to illicit information from the driver about why they were breaking the law. The second question, "or how" is a non-sequitur that points to the absurdity of the situation: the cop pulled over a rocket, which obviously don't belong on the road, so the cop must have used some kind of rocket-stopping technology to make the stop, which is equally as absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The first meaning of "over" is the opposite of "under," i.e., "on top of." So the policeman is asking the driver if he knows why he was pulled over, meaning stopped by the police, or if he knows why he was pulled over, meaning the rocket being on top of the police car. The second meaning of "over" is "finished," as in "the party is over." So the policeman is asking the driver if he knows why he was given a ticket, meaning he did something wrong, or if he knows why the rocket is no longer on top of the police car.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the policeman has pulled over a driver who is in a rocket, and he is writing him a ticket. Clearly, the rocket is faster than the police car, so the policeman must have used some sort of advanced technology to catch the rocket. The joke is clever because it is a play on the phrase "do you know why I pulled you over," which is a common question that police ask when they stop someone for a traffic violation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the policeman is asking the driver a rhetorical question. Obviously, he knows why he pulled the driver over (because of the rocket), but he is also asking how the driver managed to get the rocket in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The cop is asking the rocket driver if he knows why he pulled him over (because he was driving a rocket on the road), and how he pulled him over (because he was in a police car and used the car's lights and sirens to stop the rocket).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is asking the rocket driver a rhetorical question. The cop pulled the rocket over because it's a rocket and it's driving on the road, which is illegal. The cop is also asking how the driver knows why he was pulled over, implying that the driver should know better than anyone why he was pulled over, since he's the one breaking the law.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="225.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="227.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
