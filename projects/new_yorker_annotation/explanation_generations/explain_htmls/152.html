In this context, the question is about whether the lizard can identify potential problems before they happen, but of course, lizards can't actually see into the future.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a common interview question that is meant to assess a person's ability to think on their feet and identify potential problems. In this instance, the interviewee is a lizard, which wouldn't usually be associated with this type of critical thinking. The fact that the other problem, an incoming meteor, is one that most people wouldn't see coming, furthers the punchline.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's an interview question that is asked to job candidates, and the two lizard people are not qualified for the job. The joke is a play on the idea that lizards are "cold-blooded," meaning they can't regulate their own body temperature, and so they would be unable to work in an office (or any other indoor setting) because they would be too cold.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a job interview question, and the lizard on the phone is being asked to answer it. The joke is clever because the person who is interviewing the lizard is clearly not paying attention to the larger problem (the meteorite) that is about to affect them both.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the two lizards are in an office environment, they are still lizards. This means that they are not used to the office environment and so the one lizard is asking the other for help in an interview question. The joke is also funny because, even though the question is about identifying problems, the meteorite is an imminent problem that they both should be able to see coming.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is absurd: the dinosaurs are acting like business people in an office, but they are dinosaurs, so the authority dynamics are reversed. Furthermore, the question the first dinosaur asks the second is a common interview question, but it's funny in this context because the second dinosaur should have seen the problem coming --- an asteroid is about to hit Earth and eradicate all life!</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the two lizards are in an office, they are still acting like lizards. In particular, the question that one lizard asks the other is a common interview question for jobs, and thus it's humorous that these lizards are applying human norms to their behavior. The question is also especially funny because, given that they are lizards, they probably have a better ability than most people to sense when a meteorite is about to hit, making the question moot.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the film "Jurassic Park", in which a group of dinosaurs escape from a laboratory and terrorize the people on the island. In the film, the dinosaurs are seen as a problem that wasn't anticipated by the people who created them. However, in this office scene, the dinosaurs are the ones who are oblivious to the impending threat of the asteroid. The joke is clever because it inverts the original film's plot.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two lizards are interviewing for a job and the interviewer is asking them a question that is relevant to their skillset. Lizards are not known for their problem-solving abilities, so the interviewer's question is ironic. The situation is made even funnier by the fact that there is a meteorite headed towards the office, which is a problem that the lizards definitely did not see coming.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two dinosaurs are discussing a situation in which one of them correctly identified a problem that others didn't see coming. The problem in this case is an asteroid that is about to hit Earth, and of course, the dinosaurs didn't see it coming because they went extinct before it happened. The joke is a play on the common interview question, "tell me about a time when you identified a problem and solved it."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the movie "Deep Impact," in which a meteorite threatens to destroy the Earth, and the main characters have to scramble to save as many people as possible. The joke is that, in an office setting, the only problem the lizards see coming is the meteorite, which is not a problem that office workers typically have to deal with.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a classic interview question, but in this case, the interviewer is a dinosaur and the interviewee is also a dinosaur. The question is difficult to answer for the interviewee because, although dinosaurs are known for being extinct due to a meteor hitting Earth, that event was not something that could have been predicted or prevented.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it presupposes that the lizards are interviewees for a job at the office. The question "tell me about a time you identified a problem that others didn't see coming" is a common behavioral interview question meant to get insights into a person's ability to think critically. However, in this case, the question is directed towards lizards, who would not be expected to be able to answer it in a way that a human could.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that dinosaurs are not very intelligent. The fact that they are in an office shows that they are trying to be professional, but the question the one dinosaur asks the other is very basic and shows that they might not be as intelligent as they seem. The question also relates to the impending asteroid, which the dinosaurs don't seem to be aware of, making the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dinosaurs are in an office discussing business. The problem the interviewer is asking about is the impending asteroid collision, which the interviewee (not the interviewer) would have been able to see coming if they were paying attention. The joke suggests that the dinosaurs are so wrapped up in their work that they failed to notice the extinction-level event that was happening right in front of them.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="151.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="153.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
