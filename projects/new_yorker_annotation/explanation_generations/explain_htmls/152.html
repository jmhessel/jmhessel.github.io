In the first sense, she is using it to mean that she comes to the bird's nest to think and be alone (i.e., to brood). However, in the second sense, she is using it to mean that she comes to the bird's nest to lay eggs (i.e., to brood). The contrast between the two meanings is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the word "brood" has two meanings: (1) to think deeply about something, usually something that is troubling or (2) to incubate eggs to hatch them into young. The contrast between the two meanings is what makes the joke funny. In addition, the fact that the couple is sitting on a sofa in a bird's nest is also humorous because it's unexpected and doesn't make much sense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is saying that he comes to the bird's nest to brood, which means to think deeply about something, usually something that is causing him stress or worry. However, the word "brood" can also refer to a group of baby birds, which is what is typically found in a bird's nest. So the man is saying that he comes to the bird's nest to think deeply about something, but also, there are usually baby birds in a nest, so he is also saying that he comes to the bird's nest to think deeply about the baby birds.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="151.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="153.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
