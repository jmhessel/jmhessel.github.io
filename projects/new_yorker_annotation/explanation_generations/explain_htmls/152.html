The joke is clever because it addresses the elephant in the room directly, while also making a pun on the word "end".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the elephant in the room is a metaphor for the Republican party, which is currently in power. The fact that there's an elephant in the room is ironic, because it's a symbol of the very thing that everyone is trying not to talk about. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the phrase "the elephant in the room" is often used to describe an issue that everyone is aware of but no one wants to address, whereas the man in the joke is saying that the Republican party is coming to an end, which is an issue that everyone is aware of but no one wants to address.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though there is a gigantic elephant in the room, the man and woman completely ignore it and instead focus on the news. The elephant represents the current state of the Republican party: it's a huge problem that is being ignored. The joke suggests that the party is doomed if it doesn't address the elephant in the room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in this situation, the elephant in the room is political: the Republican Party is in decline, and the people in the room are pointedly ignoring it. Saying that the Republican Party is the elephant in the room is a way of acknowledging its existence while pretending to ignore it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the idiom "the elephant in the room," which means a big problem or issue that everyone is aware of but no one wants to talk about. In this case, the elephant in the room is the Republican party, which is in decline, and the two people are ignoring it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the elephant in the room is a metaphor for the impending doom of the Republican party. The joke is that, despite the elephant being quite literally in the room, the man and woman are instead choosing to focus on and talk about the impending doom of the Republican party, which is metaphorically the elephant in the room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "elephant in the room" is often used to describe an issue that everyone is aware of but no one wants to talk about. In this case, the issue is that there is an elephant in the room, which is a metaphor for the fact that the Republican party is currently in decline.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, of course, the elephant in the room is a metaphor for the big problem that no one is talking about. In this case, the big problem is the impending extinction of the Republican party. The joke is clever because, even though the elephant is literally in the room, the man is still able to focus on his newspaper and ignore the big problem.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the elephant in the room refers to the Republican party, which is in decline. The huge elephant in the living room is a metaphor for the party's impending doom.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in this case, the elephant in the room refers to the current US President Donald Trump, who is a member of the Republican Party. The joke is that, despite the fact that Trump is a very large and obvious problem for the Republican Party, the people in the room are ignoring him and instead making a general statement about the end of the party.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the elephant in the room is a metaphor for the big problem that is being ignored. In this case, the big problem is the end of the Republican party. The man and woman are pretending that the elephant isn't there, and they are trying to ignore it, but it's so big that it's impossible to ignore.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The elephant in the room is a metaphor for a big problem that everyone is ignoring. In this case, the big problem is that the Republican party is falling apart. However, the joke is also referencing the fact that there is an actual elephant in the room, which is a problem that everyone is ignoring.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the elephant in the room is a symbol for something that is obvious but not being talked about. Here, the elephant in the room is the impending doom of the Republican party. The joke is clever because it is true: the Republican party is in decline, and this is something that is often not talked about, or at least not openly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "the elephant in the room." The elephant in this situation is literally an elephant in the room, and it's so big that it's hard to ignore. The man is reading the paper, which has a story about the decline of the Republican party, and the woman is talking about it. The joke is that the man is trying to ignore the elephant in the room, but the woman is pointing it out.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the husband and wife are talking about the elephant in the room, which is the huge elephant in their living room. The wife is saying that the Republican party is coming to an end, which is a play on words because the elephant is a symbol of the Republican party.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="151.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="153.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
