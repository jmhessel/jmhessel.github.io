This is a play on the fact that many people prefer to see live performances of their favorite musicians, because the experience is more intimate and engaging.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is unexpected for a baby to be giving a speech at all, let alone one that is put together well enough that the parents would prefer to hear it in person rather than through a baby monitor. The joke is also clever because it is a play on the phrase "better live than on TV," which is often used to describe how a band or artist sounds better live than when their music is played on television.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully pokes fun at the fact that, sometimes, public speakers can sound better when you're actually in the same room as them, rather than just hearing them through a baby monitor (or other sound system). The joke implies that the baby is a good public speaker, despite being very young.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that many people prefer to see live music performances, rather than listen to recordings of music. The baby monitor implication is that the baby is making sounds into the microphone that are being transmitted to the parents via the baby monitor, which they would otherwise not be able to hear.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the mic in the baby's room is likely there for the baby monitor, which is a device used by parents to hear their baby from another room. The joke implies that the parents are so used to hearing their baby through the monitor that they are surprised by how clear and good-sounding their baby is when they are in the room with them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that, often, babies crying can be more tolerable when one is not in the same room as them. However, in this situation, the joke is reversed, and the parents are glad that the baby is making noise into the microphone because it means they can hear it over the baby monitor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the baby is speaking but shouldn't be able to. The monitor comment is joke within a joke because what the speaker said can be interpreted two ways: first, that the baby is actually speaking and the parents are monitoring him through a baby monitor, or second, that the baby is making gibberish noises that sound like speech when they are amplified through a baby monitor. In either case, it's unexpected and humorous that the baby is speaking.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to how a lot of comedians don't do well when they're recorded or televised, because the energy of their performance is lost. In this case, the joke is that the baby is a stand-up comedian, and his act is much better in person than it comes across on the baby monitor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "baby monitor" is a device parents use to listen to their baby's crying from another room, so that they can know when to go to the child. In this case, the baby is "on the baby monitor" figuratively: he's giving a speech, which is being transmitted to his parents via the baby monitor. But, since he's live and in person, they can tell that he sounds much better than he does on the baby monitor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common experience of parents being able to understand their baby better when they are in the room with them, as opposed to hearing them through a monitor. In this case, the joke amplifies that idea by suggesting that the monitor actually distorts the baby's voice, making it sound worse than it actually is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the two situations: a baby giving a speech is unexpected and unexpected things are often funny. The fact that the baby is giving a speech also subverts the expectations of the format of a stand-up comedy routine: typically, the comedian is the one on stage telling jokes, not the audience. In this case, the baby is the comedian and the parents are the audience.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually when you see a baby giving a speech, it is because they are being filmed or recorded by a baby monitor. However, in this case, the baby is giving a speech "live" in front of his parents, which is much more impressive. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the baby is "live" in the sense that he is giving the speech in person, but he is also "live" in the sense that he is a live human being, as opposed to being a recording.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that many stand-up comedians often say that their material sounds better when delivered in person, rather than through a recording or over a baby monitor. The joke works because it is unexpected and goes against the norms of what would be found in a baby's room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the baby is giving a speech, which is something that babies cannot do. The joke is also funny because the baby is wearing a suit, which is not something that babies typically wear. The joke is also funny because the father's reaction is nonchalant, as if this were a normal occurrence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is impossible for a baby to give a speech, let alone one that would be broadcast on a baby monitor. The joke is clever because it is a play on words --- the baby is "live" in the sense that he is giving the speech in person, but he is also "live" in the sense that he is being broadcast on the baby monitor.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
