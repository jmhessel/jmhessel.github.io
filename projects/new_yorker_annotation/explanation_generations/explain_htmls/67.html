He's a pwoblem duck, stwessed out and weady to quack.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the phrase "problematic." In the context of the classroom, a "problematic" student would be somebody who is causing problems or is stressed out. However, in this context, the "problematic" student is a literal duck, who is also stressed out and ready to quack. The pun is funny because it is unexpected and plays on the different meanings of the word "problem."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "problem child." In this case, the "problem duck" is a reference to the fact that the bird is sitting in front of a laptop, and ducks are known for making a quacking sound. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words; the bird is "stressed out" and "ready to quack" because it's under a lot of pressure to perform well in the class.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Problem duck" is a pun on "problematic," meaning that the duck is causing problems. "Stressed out and ready to quack" is a pun on "stressed out and ready to crack," meaning that the duck is under so much stress that it is about to go crazy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The bird is called a "problem duck," but the duck is also a "stressed out" quack. This play on words is humorous because it's unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because ducks are not known to be particularly intelligent animals, yet here they are, in a lecture hall, presumably learning. Furthermore, the fact that one of the ducks is "stressed out and ready to quack" suggests that even they are struggling to understand the material.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in this context, the word "duck" is a pun for "fuck": the word "fuck" is a profanity, and so the joke is implying that the duck is stressed out and ready to fuck (have sex). This is a play on the fact that, typically, when humans are stressed out, they might say they are "ready to fucking snap," but in this context, with the ducks, it is literal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the word "duck" can be both a noun and a verb. In this case, the scientists are using the word "duck" as a verb, meaning that the duck is a problem that is ready to quack (i.e., make a lot of noise). This is a play on the phrase "Stressed out and ready to snap."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "problem duck" is a duck that is causing problems, while a "stressed out" duck is a duck that is feeling stressed. The fact that the duck is ready to "quack" (a term meaning to fail or to give up) implies that the duck is not doing well.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "problem duck" is a duck that is causing a problem, but it's also a reference to the idiom "a problem child." In this case, the bird is both a problem duck and a problem child, because it's causing a problem and it's also a child.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a pun on the phrase "problematic." The speaker is saying that the duck is a "problem duck," which is a play on words since "problematic" can mean "causing problems." In this context, the duck is "stressed out and ready to quack" because he is the one causing the problem.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is conflating the words "problem" and "duck." This is a play on the saying "he's a problem child," meaning a child who causes trouble. However, in this case, the speaker is saying that the person is a problem duck, which is a non-sensical statement.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the most common problems people have with their laptop computers is stress caused by trying to get work done. This is known as the "duck" problem because the person is "under a lot of pressure" and "ready to crack." In this situation, however, it is the birds who are the ones with the laptops, which is funny because it is unexpected and makes the situation even more stressful.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the play on words between "problem" and "duck". In this context, a "problem duck" is a duck that is causing a problem, while a "stressed out and ready to quack" duck is a duck that is about to have a nervous breakdown. The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "problem child", which is a child that is causing a problem.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the idiom "problem child." In this case, the problem is not with a child, but with a duck. This is funny because ducks are not known to be particularly problematic, but the idiom suggests that they are.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because while the Infinite Monkey Theorem states that a monkey typing randomly will eventually produce the works of Shakespeare, the bird in this scene is not randomly typing, he is typing on a laptop computer, which would make it highly unlikely that he would produce anything of value, let alone the works of Shakespeare. The bird is also not a monkey, which adds another level of absurdity to the scene.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="66.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="68.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
