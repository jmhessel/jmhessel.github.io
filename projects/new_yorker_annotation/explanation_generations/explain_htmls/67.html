In contrast, the person in the bright colors would stand out like a sore thumb in nature, making them an easy target for hunters. The joke is clever because it inverts the expected roles: instead of the hunter being the one who is camouflaged, it is the potential prey who is camouflaged.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is saying that the reason she doesn't dress in camouflage is because she doesn't want to be shot. This is a play on the common joke format "This is why X is important/dangerous/etc." where X is replaced with a situation that is the opposite of what is typically expected. In this case, the woman is saying that wearing bright colors is important because it makes it less likely that she'll be shot.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is saying that the reason they don't get shot while hunting is because they dress in bright colors. This is a play on the fact that hunters often wear camouflage to blend in with their surroundings, so as not to be seen by their prey. The joke is also funny because it's a reversal: the man in the living room is the one being hunted, and the television is his prey.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="66.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="68.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
