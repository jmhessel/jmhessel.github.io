The implication is that the couple is overreacting and that the dog is not a threat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is so extreme --- the couple has gone to such lengths to keep their food safe from theft that they have trapped and locked up everything, even their fridge. But the joke points out that, even in this extreme situation, there is still a simpler solution that would achieve the same goal (putting a name on the yogurt so that people would know it belongs to someone and wouldn't steal it).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is absurd. The couple is going to extreme measures to trap or lock up everything in their kitchen so that their child doesn't eat their food. However, a much simpler solution would be to just write their child's name on their food, so that the child knows that it's not for them. This punchline highlights the ridiculousness of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is so absurd: the couple has gone to such extreme lengths to prevent anybody from raiding their fridge that it seems easier to just write their names on their food. This is a play on the idea that people are territorial about their food, and will often write their names on their food in the workplace refrigerator to indicate that it is their food.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "yogurt" can mean both the dairy product and a type of trap. In this context, the person asking the question is saying that the yogurt (the trap) could have just been labeled with the man's name (to warn people), but instead, he chose to leave it unmarked, which is more dangerous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is extreme --- the fridge is even chained up! --- and because it's a way of overreacting to the problem of people eating each other's food from the fridge at work. A more reasonable solution would be to simply write one's name on their food, but this couple has gone to great (and absurd) lengths to prevent that from happening.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur. The remark about writing his name on the yogurt makes no sense in relation to the deadly traps that are set up in the kitchen. However, the remark is humorous because it's unexpected and breaks the pattern of the conversation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple has taken such extreme measures to make sure that their food is safe, when a much simpler solution would have sufficed. Instead of setting all these traps, the husband could have simply written his name on his yogurt, so that his wife would know not to eat it. This would have avoided all the hassle (and potential danger) of the traps, while still achieving the desired outcome.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the picture is clearly not happy because he's been caught in a trap, but the woman is making a joke about how he could have just written his name on his yogurt. The fact that she's making a joke in such a dire situation is what makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who has laid out the traps is needlessly complicated. He has gone to great lengths to set up a trap, when a much simpler solution would have worked just as well. This joke pokes fun at the fact that sometimes people over-complicate things when a simple solution would do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the kitchen is trying to make his food more dangerous by adding traps, when in fact all he needs to do is write his name on his yogurt. This is because "Dieting" is the process of limiting one's intake of food to lose weight, and many people view traps as something that is designed to hurt or kill people. So, by adding traps to his food, the man is making it more dangerous, when all he needs to do is make it less appetizing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has gone to great lengths to prevent his wife from eating his yogurt, including booby-trapping the fridge. However, a much simpler solution would have been to write his name on the yogurt, so that she would know not to eat it. This joke highlights the absurdity of the man's actions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who set up the traps probably went to a lot of trouble to label them all, when he could have just written his name on his yogurt. This would have been a much simpler solution that would have avoided all the potential danger. The joke highlights the absurdity of the situation: why go to such lengths to label the traps when a simpler solution would have sufficed?</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple has gone to great lengths to prevent the other from eating food in the house: they've set up bear traps and spiked the floor, and even chained up the fridge. The man in the couple could have just written his name on his yogurt, which would have been a much more effective way of preventing the other from eating it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the refrigerator is booby-trapped with a chain, implying that the couple is afraid of someone stealing their food. However, the simple solution to this problem --- writing one's name on their yogurt --- is much less dramatic than what they have done. The joke pokes fun at the over-the-top nature of the couple's precautions.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="39.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="41.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
