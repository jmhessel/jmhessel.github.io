The joke implies that being stabbed is a common occurrence for this man, and he's just unbothered by it. Alternatively, the joke could be interpreted as the man finding out that he's just been served divorce papers, and the knife in his back is a metaphor for the betrayal he's just experienced.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a double meaning. The man says that his wife served the papers, but the papers could mean two different things. It could be that his wife served divorce papers, or it could be that his wife served him with a restraining order. The fact that he is being stabbed in the back with a knife makes the latter meaning more likely, and thus, the joke funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person on the phone is talking about getting a divorce, which is a very personal topic. The fact that he was stabbed in the back with a knife is a metaphor for how his wife betrayed him, and the fact that he is nonchalantly talking about it on the phone shows that he is okay with the divorce.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the man has been stabbed in the back with a knife, he is still calmly talking on the phone as if nothing is wrong. The joke is dark because it implies that the man's wife served him divorce papers in person, and the man being stabbed in the back could be seen as a metaphor for being betrayed by someone close to you.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a play on the phrase "serving papers," which usually means that someone is being sued or is being divorced. However, in this context, the papers have been served in a more literal sense: the man has been stabbed with a knife, and the note that was stuck into his back was "served" with the knife.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has been stabbed in the back with a knife, but he casually mentions that his wife served him papers. The papers could be divorce papers, or they could be court summons. In either case, the man's nonchalance about being stabbed is absurd, and that's what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the seemingly out-of-place nonchalance with which the man discusses his divorce proceedings, despite the fact that he has been literally stabbed in the back. This suggests that the divorce is more important to him than the fact that he's been injured, or even that his wife is the one who injured him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is nonchalantly talking about getting a divorce as if it's no big deal, meanwhile he has just been stabbed in the back. The contrast between the two events makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the man has just been stabbed, he continues his phone conversation as if nothing is wrong. The casual way he mentions that his "wife served the papers" implies that she served him divorce papers, which may have been the motives for her stabbing him. The joke is funny because it is a dark twist on a common situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man has just been betrayed by his wife, who has stabbed him in the back, but he is nonchalantly telling the person on the phone that his wife served him divorce papers. The double meaning of the word "serve" is humorous because it points to the man's cluelessness about what is happening to him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has been stabbed in the back, which is a metaphor for being betrayed. The man on the phone is discussing his divorce, which is also a metaphor for being betrayed. The man says that his wife served the papers, meaning that she initiated the divorce, which is another example of being betrayed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of a divorce, "serving the papers" means that the process of getting a divorce has started. However, in this case, the man's wife has "served the papers" in a much more literal sense by stabbing him in the back with a knife. The irony is that, even though he's been betrayed, the man is still more concerned with the technicality of how the divorce is going to proceed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who stabbed him meant for it to be a fatal wound, but the man nonchalantly continues his phone conversation as if nothing is wrong. The joke is also funny because the man's wife getting served divorce papers is the thing that actually stabs him in the back, so the person who stabbed him is just the final physical manifestation of that betrayal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a normal context, the man's statement would be completely innocuous - his wife simply served divorce papers to him in person. However, in the context of the man being stabbed, the statement takes on a whole new meaning: his wife didn't just serve him divorce papers, she stabbed him in the back - literally.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has been stabbed in the back, which is a metaphor for betrayal. However, the man is speaking on the phone and seems surprised that his wife served the papers personally. The joke is clever because it takes the metaphor literally: the man has been physically stabbed in the back, and his wife has betrayed him by serving him divorce papers.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="39.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="41.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
