In this case, the man says "It's a pretty good aircraft," but then points out a flaw --- that the aircraft is like a nagging woman because it constantly needs to be told where to go. The high heels on the landing gear add to the joke by making the aircraft look more feminine.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "ask for directions" can mean either to physically ask someone for directions to a location, or to figuratively ask for help when lost. In this case, the jet is "asking for directions" in the latter sense: it is constantly asking the pilot for help, presumably because it is lost. This is strange because jets are supposed to be highly advanced machines that do not get lost. The fact that its landing gear is high heels adds to the strangeness, as high heels are usually associated with femininity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "pretty good" can mean that something is good, but it can also mean that something is not great. In this case, the aircraft is not great because it keeps nagging you to ask for directions, which can be interpreted as a metaphor for a woman who is constantly nagging her partner.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the high heels on the jet's landing gear suggest that the jet is female, and, thus, the pilot is joking about how the jet is like a nagging wife who always wants to ask for directions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully resolves the tension between the traditional masculine role of the aircraft marshal (who gives directions to the pilot) and the feminine stereotype of women, who are often associated with needing help in order to get around. In this case, the aircraft is personified as a woman, which is why it "keeps nagging" the pilot to ask for directions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "nag" can mean both to annoy or to ask for directions, and in this case, the jet is doing both. The joke is clever because it is a way to make fun of both the aircraft and the marshal who is trying to direct it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is pun on the fact that the jet has high heels for feet. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words; the phrase "to ask for directions" is often used when someone is lost, and in this case, the aircraft is actually lost and needs help finding its way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The aircraft is nagging the pilot to ask for directions, but in a traditional sense, it's the woman who is usually nagging the man to ask for directions when they are lost. The gender roles are reversed in this joke, making it funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the stereotypical image of a nagging woman is one who is constantly telling her husband or boyfriend to ask for directions when they are lost, even though he doesn't want to. In this case, the joke is that the aircraft is like a nagging woman because it keeps telling the pilot to ask for directions. The fact that the aircraft has high heels is probably just a visual pun on the stereotype.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The pilot is talking about how the aircraft is good, except for the fact that it keeps nagging him to ask for directions. This is a play on the stereotype that women are always nagging men and that men never listen to women. The contrast between the traditional gender roles and the roles of the aircraft and pilot in this joke is what makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the stereotype that women are bad at giving directions. The joke is that the plane, because it has women's legs, is also bad at giving directions. The joke is made funnier by the fact that the plane is an aircraft, which usually would be very good at getting people from one place to another quickly and efficiently.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while most men would find a nagging woman to be a nuisance, in this case, it is the plane itself that is nagging the man to ask for directions. The joke is clever because it takes a typically female trait and applies it to an inanimate object, in this case, an aircraft with high heels for legs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The plane has high heels, which are traditionally associated with women, and the man gets on it, making it appear as though he is getting on a woman. The plane then nags him, which is something that women are often stereotyped as doing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The aircraft is doing something that is traditionally associated with women, which is asking for directions. This is because women are often stereotyped as being bad at directions. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the fact that jets sometimes have to be redirected during flight due to bad weather.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is talking about an aircraft that is acting like a woman. The contrast between the two subjects makes the joke humorous.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="208.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="210.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
