We're out of chalk.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a normal bar, the phrase "We're out of chalk" would be an innocent thing to say. However, in this bar, which is full of chalk outlines of dead bodies, it takes on a more sinister meaning, implying that the man walking in is the next victim.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man walking into the bar is being mistaken for the murderer. The murderer is usually the one who leaves a chalk outline at the scene of the crime, but in this case, the man walking in is being accused of being the murderer because there are chalk outlines everywhere. The joke is made funnier by the fact that the man is being told to leave because they're out of chalk, as if that is the only reason he's not being arrested.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The bartender is telling the man to leave because he's "out of chalk," meaning there are no more chalk outlines for him to step over, but also meaning that the man is not welcome because he's a nuisance.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="208.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="210.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
