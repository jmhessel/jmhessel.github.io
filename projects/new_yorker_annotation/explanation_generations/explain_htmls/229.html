Do you know how fast you were going?</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the high-tech rocket and the mundane police car. It's also funny because the policeman is famously addressing the driver by his wrong name: the driver's name is probably not Major Tom, but rather the name of the song by David Bowie, "Space Oddity", in which a character's name is Major Tom.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is making a play on words with the rocket driver's name, "Major Tom." "Major Tom" is a reference to the character in the David Bowie song "Space Oddity," who is an astronaut. The cop is asking if he knows how fast he was going, implying that he was going so fast that he must be some kind of space-aged being like an astronaut.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is pulling over a rocket, which is technically a space vehicle, and comparing it to a major character in a song by David Bowie called "Space Oddity." In the song, Major Tom is an astronaut who is lost in space. The joke is a play on words because the cop is asking the rocket driver if he knows how fast he was going, and the rocket driver's name is Major Tom.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the song "Space Oddity" by David Bowie. In the song, Major Tom is an astronaut who gets lost in space. The cop in the joke is stopping the rocket for speeding, and he makes a reference to the song by asking the driver if he knows how fast he was going.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The police officer is asking the pilot of the jet, Major Tom, if he knows how fast he was going when he was pulled over --- but "Major Tom" is also the name of a famous astronaut from a song by David Bowie. So the joke is that, instead of being pulled over for speeding in a jet, the astronaut Major Tom was pulled over for speeding in a space ship.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The police officer is asking the pilot, "Major Tom," if he knows how fast he was going, but "Major Tom" is also the name of a famous space pilot in a song by David Bowie. This hypothetical situation is impossible because human beings cannot fly unassisted, but spaceships frequently fly fast, so a police officer pulling over a spaceship would be more concerned with the space pilot going too slowly and not being able to reach escape velocity to leave the planet.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Major Tom is a fictional character who is an astronaut who gets lost in space. The policeman is making a pun on his name, as if he were asking how high the major was going when he was speeding in his rocket.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police officer is making a reference to the David Bowie song "Space Oddity". In the song, Major Tom is an astronaut who gets lost in space. The police officer's joke is that the driver was going so fast, he must have been trying to emulate Major Tom and get lost in space too.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it references the song "Space Oddity" by David Bowie. In the song, Major Tom is an astronaut who gets lost in space. The cop in this situation is referencing the song by asking the rocket driver if he knows how fast he was going, implying that the driver is spaced out like Major Tom.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the idea of a "high speed chase." The police officer is pulling over the pilot of a fighter jet, which can fly at speeds much faster than a police car. The officer's reference to "Major Tom" is a nod to the David Bowie song "Space Oddity", in which the character Major Tom goes off into space and is never heard from again.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is making a reference to the famous song "Major Tom" by Peter Schilling, which is about a man who goes to space and is never heard from again. The cop is asking if the rocket driver (Major Tom) knows how fast he was going, implying that he may never come back down to Earth, just like in the song.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because therocket is driving on the road, and the cop is making a reference to the popular song "Major Tom (Coming Home)" by Peter Schilling, which is about a space shuttle astronaut who is lost in space. The joke is clever because, in addition to being a play on words, it's also a play on the fact that rockets don't usually drive on roads.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police officer is pulling over a pilot who is flying a fighter jet, and is asking him if he knows how fast he was going. The joke is a play on the fact that fighter jets can fly at very high speeds, and the police officer is implied to be giving the pilot a ticket for flying too fast.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the song "Major Tom" by David Bowie. In the song, Major Tom is an astronaut who gets lost in space; the police officer in this joke is referencing that by asking if he knows how fast he was going, implying that he was going so fast he left the Earth's atmosphere.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The police officer is asking the pilot, Major Tom, if he knows how fast he was going, but the phrase "how fast you were going" can also be interpreted to mean "how fast you were moving through space." This is a clever way to ask a space-traveler if they know how fast they were going, since speeds in space are often very high and hard to comprehend.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="228.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="230.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
