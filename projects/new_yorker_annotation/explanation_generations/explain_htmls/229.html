The Devil is disappointed because he was expecting a "four of a kind" (four churchgoers) but only got three. The assistant tells him that the fourth one is an ace, meaning that he's very good, but the Devil is still skeptical, because in poker, an ace can be high or low.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "the devil's handiwork." The phrase is often used to describe something that is evil or bad, but in this case, the devil is literally being handed a group of churchgoers who are going to damnation. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the word "handiwork" can also mean a person's skill or craft, and in this case, the devlish assistant is skilled at getting people into hell.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "the devil's handiwork." The phrase is usually used to describe things that are bad or evil, but in this case, the devil is upset because the new arrivals are well-dressed and look like they are going to church. This suggests that the devil is not as powerful as people might think, and that maybe there is some good in the world after all.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "Where'd you get that?" can be used to ask someone where they got an object they are carrying, but in this case, it's used to ask the Devil where he got the new arrivals. The Devil is supposedly the one who decides who goes to hell, so the question implies that the Devil made a mistake. The punchline is that the fourth ace is a card in a deck of cards, which is a common idiom for something that doesn't make sense or isn't fair. In this case, it's not fair because the people who are meant to be going to hell are instead going to church.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a poker reference. When you have four of a kind in poker, it's called "four aces." The joke is that the devil is playing poker with the new arrivals (who are the aces), and he has won, but he doesn't know where the fourth ace came from. The fact that the newcomers are dressed like churchgoers is ironic because it's usually churches that warn about the dangers of gambling.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the people who just arrived in hell are being sent there because they were dishonest in a card game, which is a minor sin. The joke is funny because it's a contrast between the people's expectations of going to heaven after they die, and the reality that they are going to hell because of a silly reason.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of the game of poker, having four aces is an extremely lucky hand, and it would be expected that the person with four aces would win the game. However, in the context of sinners going to hell, it's not so lucky, because they are going to suffer for eternity. The joke is a play on words, using the term "ace" in two different senses.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "they're yours" is usually said to mean "you can have them" or "they are now yours". But in this context, "they're yours" means "they are going to hell because they are sinners". The joke is clever because it is both a play on words and a commentary on the absurdities of religion.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is showing the devil a new batch of arrivals, which the devil is not pleased with. However, the man says that the devil can have them, which is a nice thing to say. The phrase "I don't know where you got that" is often used when someone is caught with something they shouldn't have, such as a fourth ace (a card which would give them an unfair advantage in a game). In this case, the man is saying that he doesn't know where the devil got the new arrivals, implying that the devil may have cheated to get them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at the idea that people who end up in hell must have been doing something bad in life in order to deserve it. However, in this case, the people who have just arrived are dressed like church-goers, which implies that they were doing something good (going to church). The devil is disappointed because he was hoping for more sinners, not more saints. The fourth ace refers to the fact that there are four aces in a deck of cards, which is rare, and thus implies that these new arrivals are special.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the people walking through the door are technically new arrivals to hell, they are also poker players who have been cheating. The fact that they are wearing church clothes is a reference to the saying "clean as a whistle", meaning they are pure of sin. However, the devil, who is the ruler of hell, is not happy with them because they have been cheating. The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that the people who cheat at cards are often sent to hell in popular culture.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The people that the man is showing to the devil are "a new batch", as in a new group or new set. However, the phrase can also mean a new batch of cards, specifically a new set of four aces. In poker, having four aces is incredibly lucky, and the devil is implying that he doesn't know where the man got such a lucky hand.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "O.K., they're yours" is commonly used to mean "You can have them" or "They're all yours". However, in this context, the phrase takes on a new meaning: since the people are going to hell, the phrase takes on a more literal meaning of "They belong to you now". The joke is further compounded by the fact that the devil is unhappy with the new arrivals, even though he is the one who gets to keep them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "the devil's handiwork." The phrase is often used to describe something that is evil or nefarious, but in this case, the devil is the one being duped. The new arrivals are dressed as churchgoers, which might trick the devil into thinking they are good people, but in reality, they are damned souls. The fact that the devil is being tricked by the new arrivals makes it funny, in a dark way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people that the devil is getting are dressed nicely, as if they had just come from church. This is strange because you would expect people who had just been sent to hell to be in more disheveled clothing. The joke is also funny because it implies that the devil is a casino dealer, and he is often associated with gambling.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
