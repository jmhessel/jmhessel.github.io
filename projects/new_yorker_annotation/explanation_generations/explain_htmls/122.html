In the context of a pool, "size" refers to the dimensions of the pool. However, the fact that the pool is filled with a giant beach ball re-contextualizes the word "size" to refer to the size of the beach ball. The joke is clever because it playfully points out that people often judge each other based on superficial things like size, when in reality size doesn't always matter.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In this context, "size" refers to the size of the pool (which is smaller than a normal pool because it's filled with a beach ball) and also to the size of the beach ball (which is much bigger than a normal beach ball). The joke is that if size didn't matter, then we would all be swimming (in a body of water) or we would all be swimming in a pool filled with a beach ball.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the people around the pool are not swimming because the pool is too small, when in reality, the pool is too small because it is filled with a giant beach ball. This is a clever way of saying that the people around the pool are not swimming because they are too big, i.e., they are obese.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The first part of the joke is saying that if size didn't matter, then everyone would be able to fit in the pool. But the second part of the joke is saying that if size didn't matter, then no one would care about the giant beach ball, because it would be the same size as everything else.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "if size didn't matter" is often used to say that physical appearance shouldn't be important, but in this case it's referring to the size of the beach ball. The fact that everyone in the pool is swimming around with the giant beach ball implies that they don't mind that it's so large, which is a contrast to the saying.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "if size didn't matter" is commonly used to brush off concerns about penis size, but in this case, it is referring to the size of the beach ball. This is humorous because it is a non-sequitur: the size of the beach ball does not matter in the context of swimming, yet that is what the speaker is commenting on.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The usual saying is "if size doesn't matter, we'd all be swimming in the ocean." However, in this case, the pool is so full of the beach ball that there is no room to swim, thus playfully subverting the saying.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "if size didn't matter" is often used to mean "if looks didn't matter." In this case, the phrase is changed to "if size didn't matter" to mean "if size didn't matter." The joke is clever because it is true: if size didn't matter, we would all be able to fit into the pool, regardless of how large the beach ball is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "if size didn't matter" is often used to say that physical attributes are not important, but in this case it is literal: if size didn't matter, then the beach ball would be the same size as the people in the pool, and they would all be able to swim. However, because the beach ball is so large, it does matter, and the people are not able to swim.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the size of the beach ball is out of proportion to what would be expected. The beach ball is so big that it takes up the entire pool, and thus nobody can swim in it. The joke makes a play on the phrase "if size didn't matter," which is often used in relation to penis size, suggesting that the size of the beach ball is analogous to a large penis.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of the scene, the size of the beach ball does matter: if it were smaller, people would be able to swim in the pool. The fact that it's so large that it fills the entire pool, however, means that no one can swim. Thus, the adage "if size didn't matter" is ironic because, in this case, size does matter.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "if size didn't matter" is often used to say that people shouldn't judge others based on their physical appearance. In this case, the joke is saying that if size didn't matter, everyone would be able to fit into the pool, regardless of their physical size. However, because size does matter, not everyone can fit into the pool, as evidenced by the fact that there is a huge beach ball taking up the entire space.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The pool is filled with a giant beachball, so the person says "if size didn't matter we'd all be swimming." This is a joke because usually when people say "size doesn't matter," they are talking about something else entirely, e.g., penis size. But in this case, the person is literally talking about the size of the pool and the giant beachball.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it points out that, for all the people who are concerned about the size of their beach ball, the reality is that everyone is the same size when they're in the water. In other words, the size of the beach ball doesn't matter, because it won't affect how people look when they're swimming.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "if size didn't matter" usually refers to penis size, but in this case it is referring to the size of the beach ball. The implication is that the beach ball is so large that it doesn't matter, and that everyone would still be swimming even if it was there.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="121.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="123.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
