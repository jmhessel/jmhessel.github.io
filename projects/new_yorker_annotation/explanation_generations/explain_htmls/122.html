The idea of a snake sitting in a chair is funny because it's so unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, after the snake with the human buttocks eats the other snake, the snake is going to want a chair to be comfortable. This is absurd because, of course, snakes don't use chairs, they just slither around on the ground.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snake with the human buttocks is going to need a chair to sit down on, given that they now have that anatomy. The joke works because it's a play on words --- the snake doesn't need a "chair" in the traditional sense, but they do need a "chair" in the sense of someone to help them sit down because they have a human bottom.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snake with the human butt is probably a male, and the suggestion of the other snake is that he will want to have sex with a woman now that he has a human butt. This is a play on the idea that men think about sex all the time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snake with the human buttocks is now sitting in a chair, which is an object typically associated with humans. Snakes don't use chairs, so the fact that this snake is using one is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "chair" can mean either a furniture item that you sit on, or a position of power. In this case, the snake with the human buttocks is in a position of power over the other snake, who now has to listen to him. The joke is also funny because it is a very literal interpretation of the word "chair": since the snake with the human buttocks is now in a position of power, the other snake will probably want to sit on him like a chair.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the word "rattlesnake." In this case, the snake with the human buttocks is a "rattlebutt," and the other snake is telling it that it will probably want a chair, to sit on its human rattles.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the snake with the human buttocks needs a chair to sit down on, like a human would. This is absurd because snakes don't have legs and thus can't sit in chairs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The snake with the human buttocks needs a "chair" to sit on, but what they really need is a "chaise lounge," a type of chair. This is a clever way of saying that the snake is an awkward shape and needs somewhere to rest.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snake with the human buttocks is sitting on the other snake, which implies that the snake is using the other snake as a chair. This is a play on the common phrase "having a seat," which means to sit down. In this case, the snake is litterally having a seat on the other snake.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur. The first snake says that the other snake now has a human butt, and the second snake says that he probably wants a chair. The chair has nothing to do with having a human butt, so it's a random and unexpected thing to say, which makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the snake with the human buttocks may want a chair to sit on, that's not going to be possible given their current anatomy. The joke is also funny because, even if the snake could find a way to sit on a chair, it's not clear why they would want to, as it's not something that snakes normally do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snake with the human buttocks is going to need a chair to sit down on, given that it now has that anatomy. This is absurd because, of course, snakes don't sit in chairs, they slither.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "chair" can refer to a piece of furniture, but it can also be a verb meaning to lead or preside over something. In this case, the snake with the human buttocks is going to want a chair to sit in, but it will also need someone to chair the meeting, since it now has the human anatomy required to do so.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "rattle" can refer to both a type of snake, and a noise produced by shaking an object. In this case, the snake is producing a rattling noise by shaking its tail, which has a human butt attached to it.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
