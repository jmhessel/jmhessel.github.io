The fact that the two people watching Death in his coffin can't define irony but know it when they see it is ironic, and thus the joke is funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "irony" is often used to describe situations where what happens is the opposite of what is expected. In this case, the expected situation would be for death to be attending a funeral, not the other way around. By saying "I can never define irony, but I know it when I see it," the speaker is admitting that he doesn't really understand the concept, but he knows that this is a clear example of it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Grim Reaper is the personification of death, and yet he is attending his own funeral. This is ironic because he is the one who is usually responsible for putting people in coffins. The fact that he is in a coffin himself is a strange reversal of roles.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Grim Reaper, who is literally the personification of death, is himself now dead in an ironic twist. The couple that came to the funeral are surprised to see that the Grim Reaper has finally met his end, and one of them makes a joke about the irony of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is ironic that the Grim Reaper, who is typically associated with death, is himself hiding in a casket at a funeral. He is not dead, but is instead surrounded by people who are grieving for the deceased. The Grim Reaper's presence is a stark reminder of death, which makes the joke even more ironic and funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Grim Reaper, as the personification of death, is the ultimate embodiment of irony: he takes lives away, but can never himself die. The person who made the joke is saying that he can never define irony, but he knows it when he sees it --- and the Grim Reaper is the epitome of irony.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people looking on at Death in a coffin are trying to point out the irony of the situation, but they can't actually define what irony is. The joke pokes fun at the fact that people often use the word "ironic" without being able to define it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the irony of the situation --- the Grim Reaper, who is responsible for taking people's lives, is himself in a casket at a funeral, and people have come to mourn his death. The joke is also clever because it is a play on words: the speaker says they can never define irony, but they know it when they see it, which is technically a definition of irony.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people looking on at Death in a coffin are themselves ironic: they are commenting on the irony of the situation, but they don't actually know what irony is. The joke is a play on the often-cited (but difficult to define) literary device.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, by definition, the Grim Reaper is irony personified: the embodiment of death. However, he is also hiding in a coffin, which is a ironic because it's the place where people are typically put to die. The fact that he doesn't belong there and is just hiding makes it even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The Grim Reaper is known for taking lives, but in this instance, he is the one who has died. The people who have come to pay their respects are actually there to see the irony of the Grim Reaper's death.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people witnessing death in a coffin are commenting on the irony of the situation, but they can't agree on what irony actually is. One person says it's when "the opposite of what you expect happens," but the other person says that's not irony, it's just "reality." In this case, the definition of irony doesn't matter as much as the recognition that the situation is, in fact, ironic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Reaper, who is often thought of as being a personification of death, is himself in a situation that is close to death: he is hiding in a casket at a funeral. The Grim Reaper is also experiencing a kind of irony, since he is around death all the time, but in this instance, he is the one who is close to death.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The Grim Reaper is known for being the personification of death, and yet he is in an open casket at his own funeral. This is ironic because death is supposed to be final and eternal, and yet the Grim Reaper himself has died.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because death, the personification of death, is in a coffin. This is ironic because, as the speaker says, death cannot die. So it's ironic that death is in a coffin, which is typically associated with death.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="15.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="17.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
