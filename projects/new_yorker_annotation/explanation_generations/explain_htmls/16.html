The Rack is a torture device, and so when the man in the suit says that the knight's armor is "off the rack", he is implying that the knight got it from a torturer. This is made even funnier by the fact that the man in the suit is standing next to a rack of clothing, which is where one would typically find armor in a tailor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In a department store, "off the rack" means that an item of clothing is ready-made and available for purchase; however, in this context, "off the rack" means that the armor is being sold from a racks (i.e. a rack of torture devices), which implies that the person who was wearing it is no longer alive. This dark humor is contrasted with the formal attire of the salesperson.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the suit is trying to sell the knight a new suit of armor, but the knight is unimpressed because it's "off the rack," meaning it's not custom made. The man tries to convince the knight by saying that the guy who was wearing it previously (and who is now dead/on a rack) doesn't need it anymore, but the knight is still uninterested.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "off the rack" typically refers to clothing that is ready-made and available for purchase, as opposed to custom-made clothing. However, in this instance, the "rack" refers to a rack that one might find in a medieval torture chamber, where people were literally put "on the rack" to be tortured. The fact that the rack is next to a full suit of armor implies that the armor belonged to the person who was previously on the rack, and that the person who is now trying on the armor is their replacement.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "off the rack" is typically used to describe clothes that are ready-made and available for purchase, but in this situation, the armor is literally "off the rack" because it's being stored on a rack in the changing room. Additionally, the fact that the mannequin wearing the armor is no longer alive is darkly humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the knight is trying on a suit of armor, which is not something that knights typically wear. The man behind him is presumably a tailor, and he says that the armor is off the rack, meaning that it's ready to be sold, and that the previous owner (the guy on the rack) doesn't need it anymore. This is a play on words, as the knight is literally on a rack (a device for holding armor), and he is also the next person in line to wear the armor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Off the rack" usually refers to clothes that are ready-made and available for purchase; in this situation, "off the rack" refers to the fact that the armor is being sold by a store that sells clothes on racks. Furthermore, the joke is also a play on the fact that the man in the armor is literally "on the rack", as in he is being displayed for sale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "off the rack" typically means that an item of clothing is ready-made and available for purchase, but in this case, it means that the knight is purchasing armor that was previously (literally) worn by someone who died in battle. This dark humor is unexpected in a department store setting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "rack" can refer to a type of torture device, which is where the man in the suit of armor is presumably from. The salesperson is telling the knight that the armor is being sold at a discount because the man who was wearing it was tortured on the rack.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Off the rack" usually means that an item of clothing is ready-made and available for purchase, but in this context it means that the armor is being sold from a rack where a dead body was displayed. The suit salesman is trying to be helpful and informative, but the joke is that his delivery is quite macabre.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Off the rack" usually means that something is ready-to-wear and doesn't need to be altered, but in this context it means that the knight is literally taking the armor "off the rack" (i.e. the mannequin it's displayed on) and that the armor is being sold because the man who was wearing it is dead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The "rack" in this instance can mean either a physical rack on which clothes are hung or a torture device. The man in the suit is telling the knight that the armour he is wearing is from the torture device, and the person who was tortured in it doesn't need it anymore. This is a dark joke because it is implying that the knight is going to be tortured in the same way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Rack" can mean either a type of torture device or a clothing display in a store. In this case, the "rack" is a clothing display, and the man in the armor is trying on the armor that is on display. The salesperson's comment about the "guy on the rack" not needing the armor anymore is a clever way of saying that the armor is for sale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because most armour is custom made to fit the knight, and so it would be very rare to find a set of armour "off the rack". However, in this case, the armour is from a dead guy who was presumably tortured on the rack (a medieval torture device), and so it's a grim joke about how the knight got his armour.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words.

The fact that the man is buying the knight as if he were purchasing a piece of clothing is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
