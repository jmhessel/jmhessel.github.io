You feed him.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the common plots in science fiction is that aliens come to Earth and kidnap a human or animal to study. In this case, the aliens have beamed up a dog, which is a common household pet on Earth. The aliens are now stuck trying to figure out how to take care of the dog, since they are unfamiliar with the concept of pet ownership.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common phrase "you break it, you bought it." In this case, the dog was beamed up onto the spaceship by one of the aliens, and now the other two aliens are telling him that he's responsible for taking care of the dog. This is a difficult situation because they are in space and it's not clear how they would be able to take care of a dog.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the aliens are trying to figure out why the dog is on their spaceship, and one of them comes to the conclusion that the dog must have been beamed up from Earth by the other aliens. This is absurd because it's not possible to beam up a living creature, let alone a dog. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the common phrase "you break it, you buy it."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common science fiction trope of "beaming" people or creatures up to spaceships. In this case, the aliens have beamed up a dog by mistake, and now they are stuck with taking care of it. The dog is wagging its tail, presumably because it's happy to be on the spaceship, which just adds to the aliens' confusion and frustration.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common sci-fi motif of Beam Me Up, Scotty!, in which someone is transported by aliens to their ship. In this case, the aliens have beamed up a dog, but they don't know what to do with him, and so they are deferring to the human in the group. This is funny because it is a reversal of the typical power dynamic between humans and aliens in sci-fi.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "you break it, you bought it." In this case, the aliens beamed up the dog, so they are responsible for him. However, they are aliens, and so they don't know how to take care of a dog, or what he needs to eat. This is where the humor comes in, as they are stuck with a pet they can't take care of.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in most cases, it is the owner of the dog who is responsible for feeding the animal. However, in this case, the dog has been abducted by aliens, and so it is now the aliens' responsibility to feed the dog. The joke is a play on the common sci-fi trope of aliens abducting humans for experimentation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common saying "you break it, you buy it." In this case, the alien has "beamed up" a dog from earth, and so now it's the alien's responsibility to take care of it. This is silly because aliens would have no need for a dog, and probably wouldn't know how to take care of one.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common phrase "you beamed me up," which is often said when someone is surprised by something. In this case, the joke is that the person who beamed the dog up (an extraterrestrial) is now expecting the other person (a human) to take care of him, since he is clearly not familiar with how to take care of a dog.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the science fiction television series "Star Trek", in which the crew of the Starship Enterprise use a transporter to beam people and things up to the ship. In the show, when someone beams up, they are responsible for taking care of them. In this case, the aliens beamed up the dog, and so they are now responsible for feeding him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Beamed up" is a reference to the popular sci-fi show "Star Trek", in which the characters use a device called a transporter to beam people and objects from one location to another. In this case, the aliens have beamed up a dog, but they don't know how to take care of him and are asking the person who beamed him up to take responsibility.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it turns the usual power dynamic between humans and dogs on its head: in this case, the aliens beamed the dog up, and so now, they are responsible for feeding him. The joke is also funny because it plays on the trope of dogs being loyal to their owners: even though the dog is in space with three aliens, it is still wagging its tail, suggesting that it is waiting for one of the aliens to give it food.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common sci-fi trope of aliens abducting humans for experimentation. In this case, the aliens have beamed up a dog, and they are unsure of what to do with it. The joke is a clever reversal of the normal human-abducting aliens, with the roles now reversed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the "rules" of sci fi dictate that when you beam something up, it's your responsibility. However, the dog is an unexpected commodity --- beaming up a dog is not something that is usually done. Thus, the person who beamed up the dog now has the responsibility of taking care of it, which is not what they expected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the aliens have no idea how to take care of a dog. They just beamed him up without any thought for what they would do next. The person who said this joke is telling the aliens that they are responsible for the dog now and they need to take care of him.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="135.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="137.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
