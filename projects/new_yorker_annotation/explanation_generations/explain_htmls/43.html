The farmer is probably regretting the deal now that the spaceman has returned, as the spaceman is probably there to take the farmer to another planet or to experiment on him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common abductee story of being taken aboard an alien ship and then returned back to Earth some time later, usually with no memory of what happened. In this case, the abductors kept their promise and returned the person when the Cleveland Cavaliers won the championship, implying that the person was taken sometime in the past.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of a farmer greeting a spaceman, it is a play on the fact that UFOs are often associated with abductions. The farmer is saying that the spaceman has returned just as they said they would, but the fact that it coincides with the city of Cleveland finally winning a championship after a long drought is a coincidence that makes the joke funnier.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="42.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="44.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
