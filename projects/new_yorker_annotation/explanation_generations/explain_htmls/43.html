The word "unabridged" usually refers to a text which has not been shortened, but in this context, it describes a book which has not been read (and is thus, "unbridged"). The joke is clever because it capitalizes on the fact that the word "unabridged" can have two meanings, one of which is relevant to the scene.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it uses the word "unabridged" in two different ways. "Unabridged" can mean either that a book is complete and has all of its original content, or that a book is very large in size. In this context, the joke is implying that the book people are not only complete and have all their original content, but are also very large in size, which is why the two people are being careful.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The world "unabridged" typically refers to a version of a book that contains all of the original content, while an "abridged" book has had content removed. However, in this context, "unabridged" means that the book person behind them is unedited and thus potentially dangerous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it uses the literary term "unabridged" to describe the size of the book, which is a light-hearted way to make a pun out of the fact that the people are surrounded by large, potentially dangerous books.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it puns on the word "unabridged": in the context of books, an "unabridged" book is one that has not been cut down or edited in any way, and is therefore the full, complete book. However, in this context, the word "unabridged" takes on a new meaning: the book behind the couple is so large that it is unbridged, or unable to be bridged (over). This joke plays on the double meaning of the word to create a visual pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the term "unabridged", which means "not abridged or shortened". In this case, the person is warning the other to be careful because the book behind them is very large and therefore cumbersome. However, the joke is also funny because the book is a person, so the pun also takes on a second meaning: the book is not shortened, or not human.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Unabridged" books are complete, uncut versions of a text, while "bridged" books have had material removed, generally for the purposes of making the book shorter. In this case, the speaker is warning that the book people behind them are complete, and thus, larger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the word "unabridged." An "unabridged" book is one that has not been shortened or edited in any way, and thus is the full story. In contrast, the "unabridged" book people are, well, people who are made of books. This is a play on words because the books that make up their bodies are the "unabridged" versions of the stories, and thus they are the full story.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The books are not large, but they are unabridged, meaning that they are the complete versions of the books. This is a pun because the word "unabridged" can also mean "unfinished" or "incomplete." The joke is also clever because it is a play on the common phrase "be careful what you wish for." In this case, the person is warning the other to be careful of the large, complete book, because it is much more daunting than the smaller, incomplete books.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The couple is talking about the books as if they are people, and the word "unabridged" usually refers to a book that has not been shortened. In this context, it means that the book is very large and may be difficult to escape from.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is being threatened by Books, which are traditionally seen as innocuous objects. However, the fact that these books are "unabridged" means that they are complete, and thus much larger than normal books. This makes them more menacing, and the joke is that the couple is now in danger from something that is usually seen as harmless.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The person is warning the other person to be careful of the book behind them, which is an "unabridged" book. "Unabridged" books are generally longer and more complete than other books, so the person is warning that the book is bigger and more dangerous than the other books around them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The couple is being chased by a large, menacing book, which is the largest and most dangerous type of book. "Unabridged" books are complete, and thus contain all the information, making them the largest type of book. The joke is also clever because it is a pun on the word "abridge," which means to shorten or condense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "unabridged" means "not shortened or condensed." In other words, it's the opposite of what you would want in a coffee table book. The joke is that the book people are so big and overwhelming that the two people walking down the path are in danger of being squished.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully pokes at the idea that some books are "unabridged" versions, which are longer and often more expensive. In this case, the "unabridged" book is so long that it's following the pedestrians down the street. This joke also makes a pun on the word "unabridged," which could also mean "not bridged," or "not connected." This could be a reference to the idea that some books are unconnected to reality, or that they are "outside" of the mainstream.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="42.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="44.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
