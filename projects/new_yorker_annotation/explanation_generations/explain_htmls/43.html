They are often made around Christmas time and eaten soon after, meaning that they don't usually last long. In this case, the doctors are telling the gingerbread man that he won't make it past the holidays, meaning that he will be eaten soon.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the disparity between the size of the gingerbread man and the prognosis given by the doctor. The gingerbread man is enormous, yet the doctor says he won't make it past the holidays. This is a play on the fact that gingerbread men are usually made around the holidays, and are often eaten around that time as well.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is telling the gingerbread man that he doesn't think he will survive until the end of the holiday season. This is a play on the fact that, traditionally, gingerbread men are made during the holiday season, and so the gingerbread man himself is only meant to last until the holidays. In other words, the doctor is saying that the gingerbread man is already past his expiration date.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor and chefs are telling the gingerbread man that he won't make it past the holidays, which is the holiday that the gingerbread man is traditionally associated with. The fact that the gingerbread man is in a hospital bed, and the grim prognosis given by the doctor and chefs, is a dark contrast to the light-hearted, festive nature of the gingerbread man.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the doctors' (i.e., the chefs') and the patient's (i.e., the gingerbread man's) expectations. The gingerbread man is clearly nervous about his prognosis, whereas the doctors are nonchalant, even joking. This is because, to the doctors, the gingerbread man is just a holiday treat, and thus his expiration date is fast approaching.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the gingerbread man is huge, and the doctor says "in our opinion, you won't make it past the holidays." The holidays are when gingerbread men are traditionally made, so the doctor is saying that the gingerbread man won't live much longer, which is a play on the fact that gingerbread men are often eaten as holiday treats.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the gingerbread man is in a hospital bed, and the doctor is telling him that he doesn't think he'll make it past the holidays. The joke is funnier if you think about how gingerbread men are often made around the holidays, and how most people eat them shortly thereafter. In this context, the gingerbread man is literally being told that he won't make it past the point where people will be eating gingerbread men.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the gingerbread man is in the hospital and the doctor is telling him that he doesn't think he will make it past the holidays. The holiday in question is likely Christmas, given the presence of the gingerbread man, and the fact that gingerbread is often associated with Christmas. Thus, the joke is a play on words, with the doctor saying that the gingerbread man won't make it past Christmas (i.e., he won't survive until Christmas) and also saying that he won't make it past the holiday season (i.e., he won't survive until the New Year).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because normally, when a doctor says "you won't make it," they are referring to a person's prognosis in terms of a disease or medical condition. In this case, the doctor is referring to the gingerbread man's prognosis in terms of the holiday season: he is saying that the gingerbread man won't make it to the end of the holidays, and will be eaten before then.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity between the traditional gingerbread man, who is a Christmas decoration, and the realistically sized gingerbread man in the hospital bed. The joke suggests that the gingerbread man is so big that he is at risk of not making it through the holidays, which is the traditional time for gingerbread men.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the gingerbread man is a holiday decoration, and the implication is that he will not survive until the end of the holiday season. This is a play on the common phrase "in our opinion," which is usually used when giving a medical prognosis, but in this case, it is being used to talk about the gingerbread man's expiration date.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because gingerbread men are traditionally made around Christmas time, and the fact that this gingerbread man is in a hospital implies that he is not well. The joke is also funny because of the pun on the word "holiday": in this context, a "holiday" is a time of rest and relaxation, whereas the gingerbread man is in the hospital, which is the opposite of a restful environment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctors and bakers are telling the gingerbread man that, due to his size, he won't make it past the holidays. This is a play on words because, as a gingerbread man, he is literally made of gingerbread and will therefore be eaten during the holiday season.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the gingerbread man is a baked good, and is thus not expected to live long. However, the gingerbread man being in a hospital suggests that he is sick and might die sooner than a typical gingerbread man. The doctors and bakers are there because gingerbread is a holiday food, and they are trying to save him so he can make it to the holidays, but the prognosis is not good.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is so unexpected. It's not clear why the gingerbread man is in the hospital or what the chefs are doing there, but the joke is clever because it implies that the gingerbread man is going to die and be eaten during the holiday season.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="42.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="44.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
