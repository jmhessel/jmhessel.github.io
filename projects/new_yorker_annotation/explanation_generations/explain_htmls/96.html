The rat in this situation is strapped with wings as part of an experiment, and he's probably not too happy about it. The joke is also a play on words, because the rat is "strapped for cash" and is probably being paid for his participation in the experiment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected. The rat has obviously been testing some sort of new experimental drug that has given him bat wings, and the pigeon is his friend or fellow test subject. The rat is trying to reassure the pigeon that he's experienced in this sort of thing, and that the new drug isn't as bad as it could be.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to animal testing in the pharmaceutical industry. The rat is testing some new product, probably a drug, by strapping wings to him and seeing if he can fly. This is a clear case of animal cruelty, and the joke is funny because it's a dark reference to the inhumane treatment of animals in the name of science.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it seems like the rat is about to test out a new product, much like how new drugs are tested on rats in pharmaceutical companies. However, the fact that the rat has wings strapped to him makes it clear that this product is not a new drug, but rather some sort of faulty winged contraption. The joke is clever because it pokes fun at the fact that new drugs are often not properly tested before they are released to the public.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected. The rat is clearly not a pigeon, and the pigeon is clearly not amused by the rat's efforts. The joke suggests that the rat has a history of test-flying different objects (perhaps as part of a lab experiment), which is why he's not discouraged by the pigeon's reaction.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected. In general, we think of pigeons and rats as vermin, and not as test subjects for drugs. The idea that this rat has been tested on before, and is now being used to test a new product (fake wings) is unexpected and amusing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rat is acting like he's been through a lot of tests in his life, implying that he has a lot of experience with being a test subject. The fact that he's a rat, and not a human, makes the joke even funnier because it's unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The rat is saying that he's tested a lot of things while he was working in the pharmaceutical industry, but the word "test" can also mean "to try out," as in, he's tested a lot of things by strapping wings to himself and jumping off the roof. The fact that he's a rat also makes the joke funnier, because rats are often associated with dirty and dangerous conditions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected. Normally, when you see a rat with wings, you might think that the rat is trying to fly. However, the fact that the rat is from a pharmaceutical company implies that the wings are part of some sort of experiment, and not just for fun. This makes the situation less humorous, because it raises the question of why the rat is being tested in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the fact that rats are often used in lab tests for new drugs. The rat in this situation is testing out a new product (the fake wings) and is making a comment on how he's experienced worse things in his line of work.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unlikely that a rat would wear fake bat wings, especially if the rat didn't have any connection to pharmaceuticals (i.e. if the rat wasn't testing a product). The joke is also funny because it plays on the stereotype that rats are dirty and carry disease.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rat is wearing fake wings, which makes him look ridiculous. However, the rat explains that he's testing the wings as part of his job in the pharmaceutical industry. This industry is known for testing all sorts of new products and drugs on animals, so the fact that the rat is testing wings is not that outlandish.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because pigeons are often seen as rats with wings, and so the rat in this scene is trying to prove that he is not like a pigeon by strapping wings to himself and testing them out. However, the joke is also funny because in actuality, lots of pharmaceuticals are tested on rats before they are given to humans, so the rat is actually doing something quite normal, despite his initial attempts to prove that he is not like a pigeon.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected. The rat is talking about how he's tested a lot of different things in his line of work in pharmaceuticals, and the implication is that he's tested drugs on himself. However, the fact that he's a rat makes it less believable, and the joke is that he's actually testing wings, which explains why he's a rat with wings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rat is wearing fake wings, which is something one would not expect to see. The joke is even funnier because the rat is wearing the wings because he is testing them; as someone who used to work in the pharmaceutical industry, he is familiar with testing all sorts of things, including winged rats.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="95.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="97.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
