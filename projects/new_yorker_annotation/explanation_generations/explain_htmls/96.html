The man is talking about how difficult it is to get the monkeys out of the barrel, when he is really talking about how difficult it is to get Prozac, an antidepressant medication, out of a bottle. The joke is clever because it is a double meaning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the barrel of monkeys is a toy, and the man's comment implies that he would rather deal with his mental illness (presumably depression) via medication, rather than trying to juggle a bunch of small monkeys. The joke is clever because it playfully suggests that the toy might be more work than it's worth, and also that mental illness is something that should be taken seriously.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "a barrel of monkeys" is often used to describe a situation that is very chaotic or overwhelming. In contrast, prozac is a medication often prescribed for people with anxiety or depression. So, the person in the joke is saying that, instead of having to deal with a barrel of monkeys, it would be easier to just take a prozac pill.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="95.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="97.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
