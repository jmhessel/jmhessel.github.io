The man is talking about how, in construction, it's the things that are overhead (like a cement block falling from the ceiling) that can be dangerous and kill people. But, in the context of the restaurant, the man is literally talking about how the food that's served overhead (i.e., at the restaurant) can be killed, meaning it's not fresh or it's been sitting there for a long time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's play on words. The man is literally saying that in construction, it's the things that fall from above, like the cement block, which can kill you. However, he's also saying that it's the financial overhead of running a construction business, like payroll and benefits, which can kill you as well.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "in construction" typically means "when buildings are being built," but in this context, it means "in the business of construction." The word "overhead" can refer to both the cinder block that's about to fall on the man's head, or to the business expenses that construction companies have. The joke is saying that, in the business of construction, it's not the dangerous and physically demanding work that's most likely to kill you, it's the expenses.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because construction workers are often killed or injured by falling objects. The man in the restaurant is about to be killed by a cinderblock, which is a type of object often used in construction. The joke is also a play on the phrase "it's the little things that kill you", because in this case, it's actually a large object that's going to kill the man.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "In construction it's the overhead that kills you" is a saying that means that in the construction industry, it's not the actual manual labor that is dangerous, but the planning, management, and other "overhead" aspects of the job. However, in this case, the joke is literal --- it's the overhead, in the form of a concrete block, that is going to kill the man.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is about to be hit by the cement block is completely unaware of the danger he is in. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "it's the little things that kill you" is often used to describe how something seemingly innocuous can be dangerous. In this case, the "little thing" is a huge cement block that is about to fall on the man's head.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the phrase "in construction it's the lack of overhead that kills you." This is a common saying in the construction industry, because if a worker doesn't have enough money to live on (i.e. overhead), they will often take dangerous shortcuts to make ends meet. In the context of the joke, the cinder block is the overhead, and it will literally kill the person it falls on.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The person who is about to be hit by the cinderblock is unaware of the danger, and so the speaker tells him that in construction, it's the overhead (i.e. the cinderblock) that kills you. The joke is clever because it's true in both a literal and figurative sense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's comment is true in a literal sense: in construction, it is often the case that things falling from above (like scaffolding or tools) that can seriously injure or kill people. However, in the context of a restaurant, where the only thing overhead is food, the comment takes on a different meaning: the man is saying that the poor quality of the food could kill you.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is about to be hit by a cinderblock, which is a common construction accident. The woman is oblivious to the danger, and the man is resigned to his fate, making a joke about how dangerous construction work can be.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is about to be killed by a cinderblock falling on his head, which is an example of an "overhead" in construction. The joke is clever because it's both a literal and figurative overhead --- the man is literally going to be killed by something overhead, and the cinderblock is an example of the type of thing that is dangerous in construction.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "it's the little things that kill you." In construction, the "little things" are the things that people don't notice, like a brick falling from the ceiling, that can actually kill you. Therefore, the joke is saying that the man should be more worried about the big things, like the cement block, than the little things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "In construction it's the overhead that kills you" is usually said to mean that the working conditions in construction are so dangerous that it's easy to die. However, in this case, the "overhead" is literally a cement block that is about to fall on one of the men, and it will very likely kill him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words --- "overhead" can refer both to the literal ceiling of the room, which is made of concrete, or to the business expenses of running a restaurant. In this case, the joke is referring to the literal ceiling, but the double meaning makes it funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is about to be killed by a concrete block falling on his head, which is an example of an "overhead" in construction. "Overhead" can also refer to the expenses associated with running a business, which construction companies are always struggling to keep down. The joke suggests that in construction, it's not the expenses that kill you, it's the falling concrete blocks.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
