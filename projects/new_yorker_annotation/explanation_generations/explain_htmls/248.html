The bull is well behaved in the store because the employees gave it a "break" from having to walk around constantly. "Break time" is usually a time when employees take a break from work, but in this case, it is a break for the bull.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "to take a break." In this instance, the shop owner is saying that he has told the bull that it is allowed to stay in the shop and look around as long as it doesn't break anything. The bull, misunderstanding, breaks one of the cups. The shopkeeper then has to clarify that "break time" means to take a break from breaking things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of a bull in a china shop. Bulls are not known for their delicate handling of things, and so the idea of a bull being in a china shop is amusing because of the likelihood of damage.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it's not uncommon for bulls to work in china shops, it is unusual for them to take breaks. The fact that the bull is having to explain to his employer what "break time" means implies that he is not very bright, and is thus a contrast to the stereotype of bulls being angry or violent.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because bulls are traditionally associated with aggression, and the store-owner is saying that he used to have issues with the bull getting agitated and angry during its break time. However, once he clarified to the bull what "break time" meant (i.e. a break from work, not a chance to break something), the bull calmed down and they haven't had any issues since.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because bulls are known for being aggressive animals, and so the idea of a bull working in customer service is comical. The joke is also a play on words, because the phrase "break time" can mean either taking a break from work or breaking something. In this case, the bull is saying that he used to have issues with customers when he would take breaks from work, but once he learned that "break time" meant taking a break from work instead of breaking something, he hasn't had any issues.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull is behaving in a way that is contrary to its nature, and the only reason it is able to do so is because it misunderstands the meaning of the phrase "break time." In other words, the bull is only being well-mannered because it thinks it is supposed to, when in reality, it is supposed to be running around and breaking things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "break time" can mean two things: a) a time when someone takes a break from work and b) a time when something is broken. In this context, the word "break" is used in the latter sense, as in, the bull is so well mannered that it doesn't even break things during its break time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. In this case, the word "break" can mean two things: to stop working for a rest, or to damage something. In the context of the china shop, the bull is saying that once he explained to his boss that "break time" meant he needed a rest, and not that he needed to break (damage) the china, he hasn't had any more problems.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unlikely that a bull would be calmly browsing in an antique shop. The store owner's comment also suggests that the bull breaking things is a regular occurrence, even though it should be impossible for a bull to be in the shop in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the implied violence of the bull. In the world of the joke, Porcelain is a type of china that is made out of the horns of bulls. So, the bull in the joke is likely thinking about how the cups in the store are made from the same material as his horns. The bull's angry expression reinforces this idea, that he is thinking about how he was used to make these cups. The bull might be angry at the customers for buying the cups, or at the store owner for selling them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it is common for working bulls to have breaks, in this case, the bull is taking a break from looking at china, which is something that bulls don't normally do. Therefore, the joke is cleverly playing on the fact that the bull is doing something out of the ordinary.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "a bull in a china shop". The phrase is commonly used to describe a person who is clumsy and breaks things, but in this case, the bull is the one who is in charge of the shop. The woman's comment implies that the bull is doing a good job of running the shop, despite its clumsiness.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull is in the china shop during business hours, and is thus breaking the rules. The woman's comment implies that the bull is a particularly forgetful or obtuse employee, and thus needed to be reminded that "break time" doesn't mean literally breaking things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull is in the china shop owner's break room, and the shop owner is telling the woman that the bull has been no trouble since he clarified what "break time" means. The joke is clever because, of course, the bulls in a china shop are notoriously destructive, so the shop owner having to explain the meaning of "break time" to the bull is humorous.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="247.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="249.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
