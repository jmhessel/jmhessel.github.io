However, in this case, the man's job is to demolish buildings, which presumably he is not very good at if he is only on his second week and the city is already in ruins. The joke is a play on words, as the man is literally demolishing the city.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The couple is clearly in the middle of a bombed-out city, but the man is dressed up in a suit. The woman says "maybe his second week will go better," which could be interpreted two ways: first, that the man's first week of work was so bad that he was literally bombed out of his office, or second, that the man is so disheveled from the bombing that he looks like he's had a bad week at work.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to the movie "Weekend at Bernie's". In that movie, two friends try to prop up a dead man so that it appears he is still alive during a weekend at his house. The joke is that, in a similar vein, the person might be hoping that the man's second week in the city will go better, despite the destruction around them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man and woman in the scene are sitting on "stones," which is another word for "bombs." Thus, the joke is that, despite the destruction around them, the man and woman are calm because they are sitting on bombs. However, the joke could also be interpreted to mean that the man and woman are sitting on the remnants of a destroyed city, and the joke is that the man's second week (of being in the city) will go better than the first.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to the movie "Weekend at Bernie's", in which two men visit their boss's house for the weekend, only to find him dead. They prop him up and pretend he is still alive, leading to a series of comedic mishaps. In this situation, the man and woman are sitting in the middle of a bombed-out city, and the joke is that the man's second week on the job will probably go better than his first, since it's unlikely that he could have a worse week than the one he's currently experiencing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man and woman are clearly in the middle of a disaster zone, yet the woman is still holding out hope that the man's second week on the job will go better. This is a play on the fact that many people have a tough time adjusting to a new job, and the first week is often considered to be the hardest. However, in this case, the woman's optimism is misplaced because the situation is dire.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a darkly humorous observation on the man's work life. The fact that the woman is even talking about a second week implies that the man isn't doing well in his current job, which is probably due to the fact that the city has been destroyed. The joke is clever because it's a play on the common phrase "here's to a better week," which is used to wish someone luck. In this case, the speaker is not wishing the man luck, but merely hoping that his next week will be better than his current one.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "maybe his second week will go better" is usually said in reference to a person who just started a new job, in hopes that the person will have better luck with the new job the second week. However, in this case, the woman is talking about her husband's second week of being a bomb. The joke is clever because it is a play on words, and it is also a dark joke because it is about a woman's husband being a bomb.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is dressed in a wedding dress, and the man is in a tuxedo, which suggests they were just married. The joke is that the speaker hoped the man's second week going better refers to the first week of marriage (which is often considered the honeymoon phase), but the man's second week is actually going much worse because they are in the middle of a war zone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The couple is clearly having a terrible time, as evidenced by the burning buildings and their angry expressions. The man dressed up in fancy clothes is presumably the woman's husband, and the joke is that her husband's second week will go better than his first. The joke implies that the first week was so bad that the week itself burned down, metaphorically speaking.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The first week is a reference to the seven days of creation, during which God created the world. The second week refers to the fact that the man and woman in the wasteland are arguing, and their relationship is clearly not going well.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a bit of dark humor. The two people in the wasteland are clearly having a terrible time, and the joke is implying that things will only get worse for them. It's a funny way to cope with a difficult situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common phrase "here's to a better week," which people say to wish each other luck. However, in this case, the woman is saying it to the man after he just got bombed, which is a very ironic situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The couple is situated in the middle of what was obviously a city that has been bombed. The woman says "maybe his second week will go better," which could be interpreted to mean that the man she is with has only been in the city for a week, and thus he doesn't know any better. However, the more likely interpretation is that the woman is referring to the fact that the city has been bombed, and that maybe next week the city will be rebuilt and things will go back to normal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the phrase "better luck next time." The woman is saying this to the man, implying that the current situation they are in, surrounded by destruction, is not ideal. The use of the phrase "second week" implies that this is not the first time this has happened, and that the man has been through this before.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="68.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="70.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
