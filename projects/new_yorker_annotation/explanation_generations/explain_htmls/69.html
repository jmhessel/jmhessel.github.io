The word "molted" usually refers to when an animal sheds its skin, but in this context, it sounds like the person is saying that they liked the other person better when they were "molded," as in, before they developed into who they are now. The joke is made funnier by the fact that the person is invisible, so it's not clear what they looked like before, or how the other person could have known them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "I liked you better before you molted" can mean that someone doesn't like the person's current appearance. However, in this situation, the phrase takes on a double meaning because the person is actually a ghost, and ghosts are often associated with molting, or shedding their skin.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully ignore the fact that the person is invisible. Instead, the focus is on the fact that the person has molted, or shed their skin, which is something reptiles and other animals do. The joke is clever because it takes something that is generally seen as icky or gross, and makes it into a light-hearted observation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the man is invisible, his clothing is still there. This means that he has "molted," or shed his skin like a snake does. The fact that the other people in the room liked him better before he molted is funny because it's an unexpected thing to say about someone who has just become invisible.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common phrase "I liked you better before you changed," which is often used to describe someone who has changed in a way that the speaker doesn't like. In this case, the man has changed into something that is literally invisible, and so the speaker doesn't like him anymore because he can't see him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "molted" usually refers to the process of shedding skin that some animals undergo, but in this context it means that the person has lost their visible form. The joke is clever because it's a play on the phrase "I liked you better before you changed," which is often said to people who have changed in a way that the speaker doesn't like.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "I liked you better when you were invisible." The man in the suit is invisible, but his clothing is still visible, so it looks like he molted, or shed his skin. The joke is suggesting that the person liked the man better when he was invisible, or not present.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a put-down of the invisible person. The fact that the person is invisible is strange, and the fact that they molted implies that they were once visible but are now in an invisible state. The put-down is targeting the fact that the person is not currently in a desirable state.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is invisible, which means he must have shed his skin/molted. The fact that the other two people in the room can still see his clothing is unexpected, and the joke is clever because it uses the word "molted" in a new and unexpected context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "molted" usually refers to when an animal sheds their skin, but in this case, it's used to mean that the person has shed their physical form and become a ghost. The joke is also funny because it's a comment on how the person's physical appearance has changed and they are no longer attractive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually when people molt, or shed their skin, it's a necessary process that makes them feel better and look better. However, in this case, the person who is invisible is molting, and the other person liked them better when they were visible. The joke is clever because it playfully puns on the idea of Molting, or shedding one's skin, with the idea of being "bored to death" or "fed up with someone," which is often signified by the phrase "I've seen better."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the invisible man probably molted, or shed his skin, recently, and so his clothing is now loose-fitting. The other people in the room are surprised by this, and one of them says that he liked the man better before he molted. The joke is clever because it plays on the idea of an invisible man, but with a twist.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "molted" typically refers to when an animal sheds its skin, but in this context, it sounds like the person is saying that they liked the other person better when they were "more visible." In other words, the person is saying that they prefer the other person when they can actually see them, as opposed to when they are invisible.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is talking to his invisible friend, who has just molted (i.e., their clothing is now empty). This means that the friend is now naked, which is makes the situation awkward, since the other people in the room can see the naked friend but the man cannot.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because molting is something that animals do to shed their old skin and grow a new one. In contrast, humans grow new skin to replace the old one, but they don't shed their old skin. So, the invisible person in the room is either a ghost or an animal that can become invisible, and the person making the joke prefers them when they were visible.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="68.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="70.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
