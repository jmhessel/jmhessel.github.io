When the man says "thing," he could be referring to the watch (which, presumably, is a compass) or he could be referring to the situation they're in. If the watch isn't a compass, then they're in even more trouble than they thought.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man checking his watch is very lost, and it's possible that his watch isn't even a compass. The fact that he's checking it anyway, with a hope that it will give him some guidance, is humorous because it's futile. The situation is also made funnier by the addition of the skull, which suggests that this may be the final resting place for the two men.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the desert is a hot, dry, and inhospitable place, and the men are lost and apparently close to death. The man checking his watch could be doing so in order to see how long they've been walking, or he could be checking the time in hopes that rescue will come soon. However, the joke suggests that the man checking his watch is actually happy because he thinks they've been crawling for a long time, when in reality, they've only been crawling for a short time. This suggests that the man is delusional and might not be aware of how dire their situation actually is.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="68.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="70.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
