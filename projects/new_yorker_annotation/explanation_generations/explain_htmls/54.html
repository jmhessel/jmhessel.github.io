Wave.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "row" can mean to propel a boat through the water using oars, as the people in the boat are doing. However, the word "row" can also be pronounced the same as the word "roue," which means a wave. In this context, the joke is punning on the fact that the people in the boat are rowing against the waves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a pun on the word "row" which has multiple meanings. In this context, "row" can mean either to propel a boat using oars or to argue/have a disagreement. The joke is playfully saying that the people in the boat are having a disagreement with the wave, personified by its haunting face.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Row" can mean to paddle a boat, but it can also mean a legal dispute. In this instance, the "row" is between the people in the boat and the wave trying to capsize them. The Statue of Liberty in the background is a symbol of American freedom, and the joke implies that even the waves trying to stop immigrants from coming to America will face legal opposition.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "row v. wave" sounds like the legal term "appeal," as in "appeal the court's decision." In this case, the joke is suggesting that the only way to stop the wave (which is a metaphor for immigrants coming to the United States) is to take it to the Supreme Court. This is a silly solution because, of course, the Supreme Court can't stop a physical force like a wave.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Row v. Wave" can be read two ways: as a legal case of two parties fighting (e.g. "the Wave is suing the Row for damages") or as a description of the scene where the people are rowing their boat and a wave is passing by. In the latter interpretation, the joke is punning on the fact that the wave looks like it could theoretically damage the boat (and the people), but in reality, it is just water and poses no threat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the famous Supreme Court case, Roe v. Wade. In Roe v. Wave, the Supreme Court would be asked to rule on whether or not a woman has the right to have an abortion. However, in this case, the "woman" is actually a wave, and the "child" is the boat of people trying to escape it. The joke is clever because it points out how absurd it would be to give personhood status to inanimate objects like a wave.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "court case." In this situation, the people in the boat are going to have to row really hard to get away from the wave, and the wave is going to have to use all its strength to try to get the people. The phrase "row v. wave" is a pun on the common format of law cases, which is "plaintiff v. defendant."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in the United States. In the context of the scene, the joke is about a abortion debate: those in favor of abortion (represented by the rowboat) are trying to outrun those who are against abortion (represented by the giganticwave with a face).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the famous Roe v. Wade Supreme Court case that legalized abortion in the United States. In this case, the joke is about how the wave is trying to harm the people in the boat, and how the people are fighting back (by rowing away). The joke is clever because it takes a famous legal case and applies it to an absurd situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court case, which legalized abortion in the United States. In this case, the rowers in the boat are debating whether or not to kill the wave that is menacing them, with the clear implication being that they should kill it because it is a threat to their safety. This analogy is absurd, but it points to the irrationality of the anti-abortion argument.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it puns on the phrase "row vs. wade", which is a common legal term meaning a lawsuit. In this case, the joke is about a physical battle between a group of people rowing a boat and a wave. The wave is trying to swamp the boat and the people are trying to row away from the wave. The joke is also clever because it takes a situation that is usually seen as dangerous (a large wave coming towards a small boat) and makes it into a comical battle.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "row" can mean to propel a boat through the water using oars, but it can also mean a conflict or disagreement. In this instance, the word "row" is being used in the latter sense to suggest that the group of people in the boat are in conflict with the wave that is trying to harm them. This is a clever play on words because it is not immediately obvious that the word "row" is being used in the second, more obscure sense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the Supreme Court case "Roe v. Wade." In that case, the court ruled that a woman's right to choose to have an abortion was protected under the Constitution. In this case, "Row v. Wave," the court could rule that a person's right to row a boat is protected under the Constitution. The joke is clever because it makes a play on words, and it also references a famous court case.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it puns on the legal case "Roe v. Wade". In the Roe v. Wade case, the Supreme Court ruled that a woman's right to have an abortion was protected by the Constitution. In the "Row v. Wave" case, the joke is that the rowing team (the people in the boat) is being sued by the wave. The joke is clever because it takes a familiar legal case and re-contextualizes it in a way that is both humorous and slightly frightening.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The rowers in the boat are rowing to try to get away from the wave, but the wave is also a row: a line of waves. So, the joke is that they are trying to row away from the row of waves.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="53.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="55.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
