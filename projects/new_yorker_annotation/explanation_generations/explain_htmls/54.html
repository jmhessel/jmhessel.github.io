However, in this context, the woman is from the future and the caveman is from the past, so the woman would need to "get past" the difference in their ages in order to understand him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast in the two characters: the caveman is living in prehistoric times, while the woman is dressed in modern clothes and is enjoying a cup of coffee, implying she is living in the present day. The joke is a play on the fact that, although the two characters are living in different times, the woman is still attracted to the caveman.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "I can't get past the difference in our ages" is usually used to describe a scenario where two people are attracted to each other but one is significantly older than the other, and the age difference is a barrier to them getting together. In this case, the woman is from the future, and the caveman is attracted to her, but the fact that she is from the future is a significant barrier to them getting together.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="53.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="55.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
