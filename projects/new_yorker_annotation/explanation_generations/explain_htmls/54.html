The woman says that their next song is dedicated to the man, who presumably didn't want to go to their in-laws' timeshare in Florida because it is too warm there. This is a way of saying that the man is a wimp for not wanting to go to a place that is too hot.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is playing the guitar in the cold snow, which is an activity that is often done in warm weather. The man is shoveling snow, which is an activity that is often done in cold weather. The fact that the woman is playing the guitar in the cold weather is a contrast to the man's activity, and the joke is that the woman is dedicating her song to the man because he chose not to go to Florida (a warm place) with his family.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the woman is playing the guitar in the cold snow, the man is shoveling snow. The dedication is for the man who is shoveling, implying that he is shoveling because he didn't want to go to Florida with his family. The contrast between the cold weather and the warm weather of Florida, and between the hard work of shoveling and the relaxation of going to a timeshare, makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman playing the guitar is not dressed for the cold weather, and her choice to play the guitar in the snow is an act of defiance against the man shoveling the snow. The man is probably cold and annoyed, and the woman is making a mockery of him by playing the guitar in the snow. The fact that the woman dedicates her next song to him is a way of adding insult to injury.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of the situation, it's very cold outside and the wife is playing the guitar as her husband shovels snow. The joke is that the husband must have decided not to go on the family vacation to Florida because it's too cold outside. This is a clever way of saying that the husband is being selfish by not wanting to go on the vacation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman playing the guitar is clearly enjoying herself and the music, while the man shoveling snow is miserable. The fact that she is playing the guitar in the cold snow makes it even funnier, because it's such an unexpected and incongruous thing to do. The joke is also a bit mean-spirited, because the man is presumably shoveling snow because the family couldn't go to Florida because of him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is playing a guitar and dedicating a song to her husband, who is shoveling snow. The fact that she is in the cold weather and he is shoveling snow implies that he has chosen to stay home with her and shovel snow, instead of going on a trip to Florida with his in-laws.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a dig at the person who didn't take the family to the in-law's Florida timeshare. The fact that it is winter and the woman is playing a guitar makes it seem like the family is stuck at home in the cold while the person who made the decision to not go is enjoying the warmer weather.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is playing the guitar in the cold weather, which is something people usually don't do. The man is obviously annoyed by this, and the woman Dedicates the next song to him in a mean-spirited way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is playing a song on the guitar, and the man is shoveling snow. The word "snow" can be used as a verb meaning to cover with snow, or as a noun meaning the frozen precipitation. In this case, the woman is playing a song dedicated to the man shoveling snow, meaning that she is covering him with snow.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is playing a tropical song on the guitar, and dedicating it to the man who is shoveling snow. The joke is that instead of being in a warm place like Florida, the man is stuck in the cold weather shoveling snow.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity between the two people: one is shoveling snow in the cold, and the other is playing the guitar. The shoveling of snow is seen as a chore, whereas playing the guitar is seen as leisurely. The fact that the woman dedicates a song to the man further amplifies the joke, as it emphasizes the disparity in their activities.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the wife is dedicating a song to her husband while he's shoveling snow, and the song is probably about how he didn't take the family to Florida (a sunny, warm state) to visit his in-laws. The contrast between the current situation (being outside in the cold, shoveling snow) and what could have been (being in Florida) is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman playing the guitar is doing so in cold weather conditions (snow), which is not ideal for the instrument. The joke is implying that the man shoveling snow is mad because he wanted to go on vacation to Florida (a warm state) with his family, but he didn't because his wife wanted to stay home and play the guitar instead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. Thein-law's Florida timeshare refers to a vacation property that someone's family owns and often visits. However, the word "timeshare" can also refer to a musical performance where multiple people share the stage. In this case, the wife is playing guitar and the husband is shoveling, implying that they are sharing the stage (and making light of the fact that he is doing all the work).</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="53.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="55.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
