This is absurd because elephants don't hunt or gather, and they certainly don't think about whether or not to do those things. The joke is also funny because it playfully pokes at the idea that cavemen are not the sharpest tools in the shed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is drawing a picture of an elephant, which is a very large and impressive animal. The man is telling the caveman not to quit his day job of hunting and gathering, because it's impressive that he was able to kill such a large animal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The caveman is saying that he knows what the elephant is thinking, which is a common saying. However, in this case, the caveman is literally thinking about what the elephant is thinking, which is that he should continue hunting and gathering. The joke is funny because it's a play on the common saying, and because it's a literal interpretation of what the caveman is thinking.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the caveman is painting the mammoth, it's as if the mammoth is being trapped in the cave forever. The joke suggests that the Mammoth should keep hunting and gathering so that he doesn't end up like the painting, which is a funny way to think about it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is angry and the mammoth is in the cave. It's a play on words because the caveman is thinking about hunting and gathering, but the mammoth is actually in the cave.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The caveman is not actually going to quit hunting and gathering (which is what cavemen did for food), but he is going to stop painting pictures of elephants (which is what cavemen did for art). The joke is clever because it suggests that the caveman is aware of the stereotype that cavemen are not very intelligent, and he is playfully subverting it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because mammoths are now extinct, so if the caveman had stopped hunting and gathering at that moment, he could have been the last one to see a mammoth. But, of course, if he had stopped hunting and gathering, he probably would have starved to death, so the joke is also a play on how the caveman's actions led to the extinction of the mammoth.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is drawing an elephant, which is a Mammoth, an extinct species of proboscidean. The idea of a caveman drawing something that he has never seen before is absurd, but the joke works because Woolly Mammoths were extinct by the time Homo sapiens emerged as a species.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is probably not thinking about the hunting and gathering that the mammoth is telling him to do. The caveman is likely thinking about how the paint is going to look on the wall or how he wants to depict the mammoth. The mammoth's comment is sort of irrelevant to what the caveman is actually thinking, which makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The caveman is thinking about how to explain to the elephant what he's doing, and he says "I know what you're thinking" --- but then his actual words don't match up with what the elephant is likely thinking. Instead, he tells the elephant to not give up hunting and gathering, which is probably the farthest thing from its mind.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is angry and the mammoth is in the cave with him, watching him paint. This is a reference to the common complaints about how "cavemen" were always hunting and gathering instead of "settling down" and developing civilizations. The joke is that, even if the caveman were to quit hunting and gathering, the mammoth would still be there in the cave with him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the caveman is thinking about quitting his current lifestyle in order to become a full-time artist. The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that artists are "starving" and always on the verge of quitting their chosen profession.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The caveman is probably thinking "'don't quit your day job," but the joke is that, since he's a caveman, his day job is hunting and gathering. So, the joke is that even if he's a bad painter, he shouldn't quit hunting and gathering because that's what he's supposed to do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is clearly not a caveman, as he is friends with an elephant, which are not found in caves. And, the man is also wearing modern clothing. The joke is that the caveman is thinking about quitting his job as a hunter-gatherer to pursue a career as an artist, but the man is telling him not to quit because being a hunter-gatherer is more practical.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the common phrase "don't quit your day job." The caveman is not only a hunter and gatherer, but also an artist, and the man is telling him not to give up hunting and gathering (his day job) in order to pursue artwork full-time.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="0.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="2.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
