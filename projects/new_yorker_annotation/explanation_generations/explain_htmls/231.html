The bird is trying to talk the man out of suicide by telling him that he can teach him how to build a nest, which is something birds know how to do. But, "nest" can also refer to a person's home, as in "making a nest egg," which is what the man is presumably trying to do by jumping off the building. So, the bird is actually telling the man that he can teach him how to make a home, which is a much more positive message that could dissuade the man from suicide.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur. The man is contemplating suicide, and the bird is trying to talk him out of it by offering to teach him how to build a nest. This is silly because it's not relevant to the man's dilemma, and it's not something that would typically dissuade someone from suicide.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bird is telling the man that it will teach him how to build a nest, as if that is a good reason for the man not to kill himself. The bird is trying to be helpful, but its suggestion is not helpful at all; in fact, it's not even relevant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bird's words imply that the man won't be successful in killing himself; instead, the bird will teach the man how to build a nest, which is something birds do. The joke might also be interpreted as the bird trying to distract the man from suicide by offering to teach him something, which is something people might try to do in a real-life situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it puns on the phrase "to build a nest." The man is on the ledge because he wants to kill himself, while the bird is trying to talk him out of it. The bird is telling the man that if he doesn't kill himself today, tomorrow the bird will teach him how to build a nest. This is a play on words because "to build a nest" can mean both creating a safe place for a bird to lay its eggs, or to save up money (e.g. "to build a nest egg"). In the latter sense, the bird is telling the man that if he doesn't kill himself, he will be able to save up money and be more financially secure.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The bird is trying to convince the man not to kill himself by telling him that tomorrow, the bird will teach him how to build a nest. However, the word "nest" can also be used as a verb meaning "to settle down somewhere permanently." So, the bird is also saying that tomorrow, he will teach the man how to settle down somewhere permanently, which is probably not what the man was hoping to hear.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The bird is trying to teach the man how to build a nest, but the man is likely considering suicide, so the bird is really trying to talk him out of it. This play on words is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bird is telling the man not to jump off the ledge, and saying that tomorrow it will teach the man how to build a nest. This is a pun on the phrase "bird's nest," which is also used to describe a suicidal person's final resting place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "nest" can mean both a home for a bird, or a location where someone would commit suicide by jumping off a building. The bird is trying to talk the man out of suicide by offering to teach him how to build a bird's nest, but the man probably just wants to learn how to build a nest so he can jump off the building.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is contemplating suicide, and the bird tells him that tomorrow it will teach the man how to build a nest. "Nest" can mean both a physical structure that birds live in, and a verb meaning "to settle down." So the bird is saying that it will help the man find a place to settle down, instead of suicide.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The bird is trying to convince the man not to kill himself, telling him that there's still more to learn in life. The bird says "tomorrow I'll teach you how to build a nest," but the word "nest" can also mean a resting place for the dead. So the bird is actually telling the man that tomorrow he can learn how to build a coffin.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The bird is trying to talk the man out of jumping by saying that if he doesn't jump today, tomorrow the bird will teach him how to build a nest. This task is much more reasonable than talking a person out of suicide, and so the bird's suggestion is silly. But, the word "nest" can also be a homonym for "next", as in "the next thing", which the bird is saying in an indirect way. So the bird is actually saying, "Don't jump off the ledge today, because the next thing that will happen is you will hit the ground and die." This is a more direct way of telling the man not to jump, but it's also more morbid, which makes the joke funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected. The bird is trying to help the man by teaching him how to build a nest, which is a useful skill for a bird. However, this skill is not as useful for a human, especially one considering suicide. The bird's efforts to help the man are misguided, but well-intentioned.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bird is trying to talk the man down from suicide by telling him that there's still something he can learn from life, namely how to build a nest. This is ironic because, at face value, it seems like a worthless skill to learn when compared to all the other things one could learn; it's only valuable to a bird. The joke implies that, from the bird's perspective, the man has a lot to live for since there's still so much he can learn.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bird is trying to dissuade the man from suicide by offering to teach him how to build a nest tomorrow, as if that is a life-changing event. The bird is also suggesting that the man's current situation, standing on a ledge about to commit suicide, is not as dire as it seems because he can always learn how to build a nest and start over.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="230.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="232.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
