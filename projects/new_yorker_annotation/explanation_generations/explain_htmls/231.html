In this case, the ref is advising the boxers to keep their feet up to avoid stinking up the ring with their foot odor. However, the boxers are so big that lifting their feet up would be difficult, if not impossible.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the ref's message. A common message given by a referee before a boxing match is "(insert boxer name) has the right to remain silent," but in this case, the ref is giving a message about foot odor, which is not something typically associated with boxing. The joke works because it's a unexpected but relevant message in the context of two very large boxers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The ref is saying that, before the match starts, he wants to give a "foot odor" speech, which is a type of deodorant. However, the boxers are so large that their feet would be very smelly, so the ref's speech is ironic.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="230.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="232.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
