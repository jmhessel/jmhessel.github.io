However, the size of the wheel and the fact that it's carved suggest that it's not a surprise birthday present, but rather a piece of art that the man owns. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the wheel is both a sculpture and a tool, and the man is both the owner and the person who will be using it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is unexpected for someone to be chiseling a stone wheel in their living room. It's even stranger that the person would want their guests to look surprised when they see it. The joke suggests that the person chiseling the stone wheel is doing something they know is strange and are trying to downplay it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the women is telling the other to act surprised when the man comes into the room. But the problem is, the surprise would be acting like seeing a man chiseling a giant stone wheel in his home is normal --- which it isn't.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is telling the other person to lie and look surprised when their husband/boyfriend walks in. The awkwardness of the conversation is made funnier by the fact that the husband/boyfriend is chiseling a large stone wheel in the foyer and is thus not likely to be surprised by anything.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the other room is trying to act surprised at the giant donut, even though it's probably not that surprising given the context (based on the fact that the women are chatting and drinking). The joke is a play on the fact that, often, people will say "try to look surprised" when they are about to take a picture of someone who is not actually that surprised.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is being asked to act surprised, which implies that the huge wheel is not actually surprising. This is a play on words, because the man is being asked to pretend to be surprised (i.e., act), but the situation is not really surprising. The joke is also funny because the wheel is so big that it's hard to believe that it would be in someone's living room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's10     chiseling a stone wheel is so unexpected that it's difficult to know how to react. The punchline, "try to look surprised," suggests that the women's default reaction (whatever that may be) is not the appropriate response, and that they should try to feign surprise instead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the other room has to pretend to be surprised when the women in the living room come in. The joke is clever because, on one hand, the man pretending to be surprised is silly, but on the other hand, if the women saw the donut, they would actually be surprised.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is trying to act surprised, even though the donut is so big it's hard to pretended to be surprised by it. The joke is a play on the idea that it's hard to fake surprise.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is not entirely clear what is going on. The two women seem to be having a normal conversation, but the man in the other room is staring at a giant donut. It is possible that the donut is a prop for some sort of play or performance, and the man is supposed to be surprised by it. Or, the donut could be real, and the man is just really surprised by it. In either case, the joke is funny because of the incongruity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's intense focus on chiseling the stone wheel makes it clear that he is not actually surprised by the women's visit. The joke is clever because it uses the double meaning of the word "surprise": the first meaning is the emotion of being pleasantly shocked by an unexpected event, while the second meaning is an event that causes that emotion. In this case, the man is not surprised by the visit, but he is the event that causes the women to be surprised.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is trying to look surprised at the giant donut, but it's not clear why he would be surprised. The joke suggests that the man knows that the donut is there, even though it's not clear how he could know, and that the women are surprised, even though it's not clear why they would be.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the women is telling the other to try to act surprised when the man comes into the room with the giant donut. But, the joke is also funny because it's not clear why the man would need to bring a giant donut into the room in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is being instructed to pretend to be surprised, even though it's clear that he's not. The sculpture is so out of place that it's obvious that it wasn't there before, and the fact that he's being told to act surprised suggests that the women put it there as a prank.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "try to look surprised" is typically used when someone is about to be surprised, e.g., when someone is about to see a magic trick. In this case, the person is being told to try to look surprised when they see the large stone wheel, which is likely a sculpture. The fact that they are being told to try to look surprised suggests that the sculpture is not particularly impressive or interesting.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="230.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="232.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
