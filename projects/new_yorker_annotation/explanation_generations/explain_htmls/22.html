The bear is not actually recommending that the fish eat the trout, but is instead saying that the trout would be a good meal for him. This is funny because it's a creative use of language to make a pun, and also because it's a bit of a non-sequitur.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The salmon are recommending the trout (a type of fish) to the bear as something to eat. But, the word "trout" can also mean "out," as in "to leave." So, the salmon are also recommending that the bear leave the waterfall.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The trout is a type of fish, and so the speaker is suggesting that the bear eat the fish. However, "trout" can also mean to make a feeble attempt, and so the speaker is also saying that the bear's attempt to catch the fish is feeble.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non-sequitur. The bear is not asking for the salmon's recommendation on what to eat, but the salmon provides it anyways. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words: the salmon is recommending that the bear eat trout instead of salmon.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bear is IGNORING the salmon swimming up the waterfall and instead is recommending the trout, which are (presumably) swimming downstream. The joke pokes fun at the bear's preoccupation with his own personal preferences, even when he's in a position to have authority on the matter.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the salmon are swimming upstream, which is what they are supposed to do, but they are unaware that they are being hunted by the grizzly bear. The bear is recommending the trout because they are an easier target.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The bear is recommending the trout, a type of fish, for the other fish to jump up the waterfall. However, the bear is also offering this advice because he wants to eat the fish, so it's not entirely altruistic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the grizzly bear is recommending a different type of fish for the salmon to eat. This is silly because grizzly bears are known to eat salmon, so the bear is effectively recommending that the salmon become its meal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bear is making a meal recommendation to the fish. The recommended meal, trout, is also a type of fish. This is humorous because it is a case of carnivorous animals recommending a fellow member of their food chain as a meal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the salmon are giving the bear a food recommendation, and the recommend the trout. The joke is clever because it is a play on words; the salmon are recommending the trout (a type of fish) as food for the bear, but "trout" is also a term used to describe a novice or beginner in fishing. Thus, the salmon are saying that the bear is a beginner and would be better off eating the trout.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the salmon are recommending a different type of fish to the bear. The reason this is funny is because, in the wild, grizzly bears often eat salmon, so the salmon are essentially telling the bear to eat something else so that they won't be eaten.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "I recommend the trout" can mean both "I suggest you eat the fish known as trout" and "I advise you to jump like a trout". In the context of the scene, where a bear is looking at fish trying to jump up a waterfall, the latter meaning is more appropriate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because salmon are a type of fish that is often eaten by humans, so the fact that the grizzly bear is suggesting that they eat the trout instead is humorous. Furthermore, the fact that the salmon have human-like expressions of fear adds to the humor because it is unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "trout" can mean both a type of fish and a word meaning "to deceive or cheat." In this context, the bear is telling the salmon that they are being duped by swimming upstream, because they will eventually be eaten by him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Trout" is another type of fish, and so the speaker is recommending that the salmon try a different type of fish. However, the fact that they arerecommending a different type of fish while the salmon are being hunted by a bear also makes the joke a bit dark, as it is a warning that the salmon will be eaten if they don't try to escape.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="21.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="23.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
