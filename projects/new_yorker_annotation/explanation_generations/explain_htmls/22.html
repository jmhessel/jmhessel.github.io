I'm not an idiot.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is spraying the toaster with a hose, which one might do if the toaster were on fire. However, the toaster is unplugged, so it's not actually on fire. The man is spraying the toaster with a hose, but he's not an idiot, because he knows to unplug the toaster first.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it's true that you shouldn't spray water on an electrical appliance that is plugged in, the man in this scene is not doing that. He is spraying water on an unplugged toaster. The other man is staring at him because it looks like he is doing something dumb, but he's not --- he's just hosing off an unplugged toaster.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is doing something that is seemingly dangerous --- spraying water on an electrical appliance. However, he is actually being cautious by unplugging the toaster before he sprays it, showing that he is not an idiot. The joke is a play on the stereotype that people who are doing something dangerous are often idiots.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is spraying water on an unplugged toaster. This could be interpreted in two ways: first, that the man is spraying water on the toaster because he thinks it will somehow fix it or make it work better, which is clearly not the case. Second, that the man is spraying water on the toaster as a way to clean it, which is also not necessary since the toaster is not plugged in and thus not receiving any power. Either way, the man appears to be acting in a way that could be interpreted as idiotic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man watering the toaster is doing something that doesn't make sense. The other man is staring at him because he thinks he's an idiot, but the man explains that he's not an idiot, he's just unplugged the toaster. Even though unplugging the toaster doesn't make it okay to water it, it does make the man seem less like an idiot.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is spraying water on an unplugged toaster. This is silly because the toaster is not plugged in and therefore can't be turned on. The man is acting like he's doing something useful, when really he's just wasting water.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man hosing off the toaster is doing something that is obviously unnecessary: you don't need to spray down a toaster with water, let alone hose it off. Furthermore, the fact that the man is hosing it down suggests that he thinks it's a good idea, which is absurd. The other man's response of "It's unplugged. I'm not an idiot." is funny because it points out the man's mistake in a condescending way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is doing something that is physically impossible: he is hosing down an unplugged toaster. The toaster cannot be turned on if it is unplugged, so hosing it down is unnecessary. This man is not an idiot, as he says in the punchline, but he is doing something that is idiotic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is spraying the toaster with a hose, which would have no effect if the toaster were plugged in and turned on. The joke is clever because the man isn't actually an idiot, he's just doing something that looks idiotic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man spraying the toaster with the hose is doing so because the toaster is unplugged, and thus not able to conduct electricity and start a fire. The neighbor, upon seeing the man spraying the toaster, assumes he is trying to put out a fire that has already started. The man has to assure the neighbor that he is not, in fact, an idiot.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man watering the toaster is doing something that doesn't make sense: you don't need to spray a toaster with water, because it's not an electronic that can be damaged by water. The man is doing it anyway, and when the other man points out that he must be an idiot, he retorts that the toaster is unplugged --- meaning that even if he were an idiot, he couldn't damage the toaster because it's not plugged in and turned on.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man hosing off the toaster is acting like he's doing a common, everyday activity --- washing his car. However, the act of washing an unplugged toaster is actually quite silly, and the man is aware of this. He's not an idiot, he just appears to be doing something nonsensical.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is spraying water on an unplugged toaster. He is doing this in a way that suggests he is trying to clean it, but he is not an idiot, which means he knows that there is no danger of the toaster being turned on and electrocuting him. The joke is clever because it is both a play on words (unplugged/idiot) and a physical gag (the toaster in the middle of the driveway).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is spraying water on an unplugged toaster, which is a useless act. The man's neighbor is trying to tell him this, but the man insists that he knows what he's doing, even though it's clear he doesn't.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is spraying water on an unplugged toaster, which is futile. The joke is clever because the man himself is aware that he's not an idiot, but the joke is co-opting his defense to make him seem foolish.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="21.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="23.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
