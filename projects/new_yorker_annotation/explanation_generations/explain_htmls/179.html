The waiter is trying to be helpful by suggesting that he order something that's not even on the menu.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common restaurant scam of upselling customers on items that aren't on the menu. In this case, the man is so confused by the size of the menu that he's not even sure what items are available, so the waiter takes advantage of the situation to sell him things that he normally wouldn't order.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is making a joke about how the menu is so large that the waiter probably doesn't even know all of the items that are available. He's implying that there are secret menu items that are only available to those in the know. This is a common joke format, with the punchline being something that is unexpected but makes perfect sense in the context of the setup.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man clearly has a lot of money, and is thus used to getting whatever he wants. The waiter, knowing this, tries to upsell him by offering items that aren't even on the menu.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The waiter is asking if he can talk to the man about items that aren't on the menu, i.e., things that the restaurant doesn't serve. But the menu is so big that it's difficult to see what is and isn't on it, so the waiter could also be asking if he can tell the man about a few menu items that he might have missed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the menu is so big that the waiter must be assumed to be familiar with all of the items on it. However, the waiter is offering to tell the man about items that are not on the menu, which may be more juicy or interesting. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the waiter is not actually going to tell the man about any item, but is instead going to tell him a story ("a few items").</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is holding a menu that's twice his size, so the waiter's suggestion that he tell the man about "a few items that aren't on the menu" could be interpreted as meaning that there are secret menu items that the man doesn't know about. However, it could also be interpreted more literally, as in, there are items that the waiter isn't going to recommend because they aren't on the menu. The ambiguity is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man can't actually tell the waiter about items that aren't on the menu because that would defeat the purpose of having a menu in the first place. However, the waiter could tell the man about off-menu items, which are usually items that the restaurant can make but don't have listed. The joke is clever because it's a pun on the double meaning of the word "menu."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter is going above and beyond his duties in offering items that are not on the menu. It's unclear why the waiter would do this, but it's possible that he is trying to upsell the customer, or he could be trying to be helpful by giving the customer more options. Either way, it's unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's menu is so large that it's likely that he will order something that's not actually on the menu. The waiter might then have to go off-script and tell the man about dishes that the restaurant offers that aren't listed on the menu.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully suggests that the waiter is going to give the man a "special" menu --- one that is not actually printed. This might be because the restaurant is out of some of the items, or because the waiter wants to upsell the man on more expensive items. In either case, it's a funny way to tell the customer that they can't have what they want.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has a menu that is so large that it's the size of a table. The waiter is offering to tell him about items that aren't even on the menu, which implies that the restaurant has an even larger selection than what is listed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter is offering to tell the man about items that are not on the menu. This is usually not something that waiter would do, and it's a bit odd. Perhaps the waiter is being cheeky, or perhaps there is something special about the restaurant that the waiter wants to share with the customer.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at the fact that most restaurants have a secret menu that is not listed on the regular menu. The secret menu often consists of items that are made with ingredients that are already available at the restaurant, but are not listed as options. The joke suggests that the waiter is trying to upsell the customer by offering him items that are not even on the menu.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is asking for items that aren't on the menu, which the waiter isn't supposed to do. The waiter is instead supposed to recite the items that are on the menu. However, because the man has such a huge menu, the waiter might be able to point out a few things that the man hasn't considered.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="178.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="180.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
