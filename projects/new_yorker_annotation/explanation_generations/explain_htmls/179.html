The person is saying that the driver could have taken a "limo" --- a shortened form of "limousine" --- instead of a taxi, which is a more common and less expensive type of car. In this context, though, the person is literally asking why the driver can't take a stairs instead of a taxi, which is a much harder feat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the taxi driver is taking an unconventional mode of transportation in order to enter the fancy building, and the person asking the question doesn't understand why he's doing it. The joke is also funny because it pokes fun at the elitism of people who take limos, implying that they think they are better than everyone else.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the taxi is a convertible, which is usually associated with being a luxury car. In contrast, the taxi is taking the stairs instead of the elevator, which is a much more mundane task. The joke is poking fun at the fact that the taxi is doing something that is very out of the ordinary, and thus, not befitting of a luxury car.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="178.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="180.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
