The sperm whale is "beached" on the island, meaning that it is stuck on land. This is similar to how a person can be "stranded" on an island, meaning that they are stuck there without a way to leave. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the common dating site warning to "be careful of whales"---i.e., people who lie about their appearance on their profiles. In this case, the person who was lied to ended up being beached by the whale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is poking fun at the fact that, while the whale is beached on the island, the person that it is beached on top of is technically not beached. The person is still technically in the water, albeit underneath a lot of whale. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words, as the word "beach" can also refer to a shoreline. So, the person could technically say that they were beached on the island, but they would technically be lying.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it suggests that the person who is now stuck underneath the whale is there because he or she lied on their online dating profile. The person's situation is made worse by the fact that they are now stuck underneath a large whale on a small island. This joke plays on the idea that people often lie on their dating profiles, and that this can lead to disastrous consequences.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the whale is so large that it can be seen from space, which means that it's bigger than the person it's stranding. This size difference is unexpected and funny. Additionally, the joke makes a play on the fact that the person is underneath the whale, which is a metaphor for being "under someone's thumb" or not having any power in a situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because thefeet are presumably those of someone who had been lying on the beach, sunbathing. The person was probably not expecting a whale to land on them, and so they are now buried underneath the whale. The joke is also a commentary on dating apps, which are often full of people who " misrepresent" themselves in their profiles.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In this case, the word "profile" refers to the side view of the sperm whale, which is very large. However, it can also refer to an online dating profile, which is often not entirely accurate or honest. Thus, the man who is underneath the whale can be seen as someone who was deceived by an inaccurate online dating profile --- in other words, he got "catfished."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "profile" can refer to two different things: first, it can be a person's biography or physical characteristics. Second, it can be a person's online dating profile. In this case, the person is referring to the second definition, i.e., that the person's online dating profile wasn't accurate. The joke is clever because it's unexpected --- you wouldn't typically expect to find a reference to online dating in the context of a beached whale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the whale is beached on the small island, and he is crushing a man beneath him. The man is probably trying to save the whale, but the whale is too big and he doesn't fit on the island. The joke is also funny because the man's profile is probably on a dating website, and he was probably not honest about his weight, which is why he is now crushing the man.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "profile" the person is referring to is not a profile like on a dating website, but rather the side view of the whale. The joke is that the whale's profile wasn't honest, in that it didn't mention that it was so large that it could cover an entire island.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man stranded on the island clearly didn't expect the whale to be so large, and is now regretting his decision to try to ride it. The joke is also a play on the "OK Cupid" dating website, which asks users to create profile pages where they can list their interests, among other things. Many users create profiles that are not entirely honest, and so the man's predicament can be seen as a metaphor for someone being "catfished" on the website.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it uses the whale's beaching as a metaphor for online dating. In online dating, people often "beach" themselves by lying about their age, weight, height, etc. on their profile, and then they are disappointed when they meet in person and the other person doesn't look like their profile. In this case, the whale is beached because he lied about his size (he's too big for the island), and he's crush the man and the tree beneath him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "profile" can refer to the side or outline of an object, as in the profile of a whale. However, the word "profile" can also refer to a person's online dating profile, which is often not honest. In this case, the whale's "profile" is not honest because it's not really an accurate representation of what whales are like.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the beach is talking to the whale as if it is a person that he met on a dating app. He is implying that the whale was not being honest about its size when they were chatting online. This is surprising because, of course, the whale is an animal and not a person who can deliberately misrepresent itself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a light-hearted way to address a very unusual situation. The big sperm whale on the small island is an unexpected sight, and the joke is a way to make light of it. The profile refers to the online dating profile of the person who is stranded on the island, which may not have been entirely accurate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the beached whale is a metaphor for being "catfished". In other words, the man thought he was going to meet a nice, small whale like the one in his profile picture, but instead he got a much larger, more dangerous whale. The joke is also a play on the fact that people often lie on their dating profiles, so the man was "catfished" in more ways than one.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="178.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="180.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
