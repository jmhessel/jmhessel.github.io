The joke implies that the dog is aware of this (hence the dog's confusion), and is making a self-deprecating joke about its inability to do something simple correctly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the dogs is wearing their Elizabethan collar, which is used to prevent animals from licking their wounds, backwards. The dog implies that he could never get away with wearing the cone backwards, because it would be obvious to everyone that he's not following the proper protocol for using the cone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The dog is saying that he couldn't pull the cone off his head, but he's also saying that he couldn't manage to wear the cone backwards like the other dog is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is talking about how he could never manage to put the cone on his head backwards, even though that is exactly what has happened. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the dog could not "pull that off" meaning he couldn't manage to do it, but he also literally could not "pull that off" because the backwards cone is blocking his view.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The dog with the cone on properly is saying that he could never "pull that off" meaning he could never wear the cone backwards like the other dog is. But, the other dog is actually wearing the cone backwards, so the first dog's statement is incorrect.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cone is ineffective in preventing the dog from scratching if it is facing the wrong way. This is similar to how people often say they "could never pull that off" when they see someone doing something they think is impressive or beyond their abilities. In this case, the speaker is saying they could never manage to wear the cone in an ineffective way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The dog is literally talking about how he couldn't "pull that off" meaning he couldn't manage to put the cone on his head correctly, facing the right direction. However, the phrase "I couldn't pull that off" is often used as a way of saying "I couldn't manage to do that" --- in this case, the dog is saying that he couldn't manage to put the cone on his head the way it's supposed to be worn.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the phrase "I could never pull that off." The phrase is typically used to mean that someone couldn't manage to do something difficult, but in this case, it refers to the dog literally not being able to pull the cone off its head because it is on backwards. The confusion of the first dog and the happiness of the second dog makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog with the cone around its head backwards is making a fashion statement. The other dog is admiring the confidence of the dog who is rocking the backwards cone, and saying that he could never pull it off himself. This joke is clever because it is a play on words: the dog with the cone is not actually "pulling it off" in the sense of being successful, because the cone is not serving its intended purpose.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The dog on the left is saying that he couldn't pull off the backwards cone, meaning that he couldn't wear it in the reverse direction. However, "pulling off" can also refer to succeeding at something, so the dog on the right is saying that he successfully pulled off wearing the cone backwards.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the flipped around cone looks like a party hat. So the dog wearing it correctly is not only confused about why the other dog's cone is backwards, but also envious that the other dog looks like they're having more fun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cone around the dog's neck is supposed to prevent it from scratching itself, but because it's on backwards, it's not actually doing its job. The other dog is remarking that he could never pull off wearing the cone backwards and still look cool, implying that the first dog does look cool despite the mistake.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is talking about how he could never wear his cone backwards. This is a play on words because the other dog's cone is backwards, and thus the first dog is making a joke about how he would never be able to wear his cone in the same way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is clever wordplay. The cones that the dogs are wearing are called "Elizabethan collars," which are meant to protect dogs from licking their wounds. However, because one dog has their cone on backwards, it is not serving that purpose. The dog with the cone on correctly says that they could never "pull that off," meaning they could never wear the cone backwards, but the dog wearing the cone backwards has already done so.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The dog is talking about how he could never "pull that off" in the sense of being able to take the cone off, since it's on backwards and he can't reach it to take it off. But the other dog interprets this as meaning that he couldn't manage to do something else, likely in the sense of a daring feat or heist.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="170.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="172.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
