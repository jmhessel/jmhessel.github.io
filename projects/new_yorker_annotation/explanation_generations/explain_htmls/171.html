The joke is that the rangers didn't bring their MetroCards, which are needed to ride the subway in New York City.

It's unexpected to see subway trains in a forest because they don't belong there, similarly to how one might not expect to see an item like a MetroCard in a forest because it's a city item.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is unexpected to find subway cars in the middle of the forest. The punchline is clever because it makes a play on words: the speaker didn't bring their MetroCard, which is needed to ride the subway, but they also didn't think to bring their Subway card, which would be needed to order food from the Subway restaurant chain.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The speaker is talking about how they didn't bring their MetroCard, which is necessary to ride the subway in New York City. However, the MetroCard doesn't work in the forest, because the subway trains don't go there. The joke is clever because it's a play on words that is also specific to New York City.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The MetroCard is a card used to pay fares on the subway in New York City. However, in this case, the MetroCard is also a card used to pay fares on the subway in the forest. The joke is clever because it is a play on words that also makes a pun on the fact that the subway trains don't belong in the forest.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in order to ride the subway, one needs to have a MetroCard, which is a card that allows access to the transit system in New York City. However, the speakers are in a forest, far away from any city, so the MetroCard is useless. The joke is a play on the common saying, "of all the things I packed, I didn't think to bring X," where X is usually something essential, like a toothbrush. In this case, the essential item is a MetroCard, but it's essential for a completely different reason.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a MetroCard is a card used to ride the subway, which is an urban transportation system. In contrast, the joke is set in a forest, where there is no need for a subway because there are no urban areas. Thus, the MetroCard is an urban item out of place in a rural setting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in order to ride the subway, you need a MetroCard, which you can purchase at any subway station. However, since these hikers are in the middle of the forest, there is no subway station nearby, so the person who packed for the trip neglected to bring a vital item.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the hikers are in the middle of the forest, and therefore the last place you would expect to find a subway train. The fact that they didn't bring a MetroCard implies that they weren't expecting to find a subway train, which makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rangers are in a forest and they find two subway trains. The joke is that they didn't bring their MetroCards, which are needed to ride the subway in New York City. This is funny because it's a very specific detail that most people wouldn't think to bring with them on a hike in a forest.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected to find subway trains in a forest. The two rangers presumably hiked into the forest to find the subway trains, and thus, the speaker didn't think to bring their MetroCard, which is only needed to ride the subway in New York City. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the ranger didn't think to bring their "metro card," but they didn't need one because they found a "metro" (subway train) in the forest.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur. The joke-teller brings up the issue of packing for the hike, and then says that they forgot to bring their MetroCard, which is only needed for the subway system in New York City. The fact that they are in a forest and there are subway trains implies that they are not in New York City, making the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur. The speakers are in the middle of nature, far away from any city, and so the subway cars are out of place. But even if they were in a city, the speaker's lack of a MetroCard, which is required to ride the subway, would still be a problem. The joke is funny because it's a unexpected objects in an unexpected place, followed by an even more unexpected problem.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is saying that even if they had known they would be encountering a subway car in the forest, they still wouldn't have been able to use it because they forgot to bring their MetroCard, which is necessary to ride the subway in New York City. The joke implies that the speaker is from New York City, and is thus used to seeing subway cars, but is surprised to see them in the forest.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected to see subway trains in the middle of the forest. The fact that the person didn't bring their MetroCard shows that they weren't expecting to see subway trains, which implies that the sight of the subway trains is out of the ordinary.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
