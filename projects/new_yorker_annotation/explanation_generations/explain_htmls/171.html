The joke is a play on words, as the two objects are similar sounding but have different uses.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the game of dominoes, which is similar to bowling. In dominoes, players knock down dominoes that are arranged in a line; in bowling, players knock down pins that are arranged in a triangle. The joke is that the men are preparing to demolish a bowling pin alley with a wrecking ball, which is not how either game is typically played.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="170.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="172.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
