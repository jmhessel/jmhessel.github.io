Roger, the man with the OUT sign, is sexually frustrated and so everything reminds him of sex; in contrast, the woman with the IN sign is telling Roger that he needs to focus on getting a job and not think about sex.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman with the "OUT" sign is trying to leave the office, and the man with the "IN" sign is trying to come in, but the CEO is preoccupied with something else and is not paying attention to them. The joke is clever because it uses the double meaning of the word "sign" --- both the physical signs that the two people are holding, and the fact that the CEO is "signing" away his time and not paying attention to what's happening around him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The punctuation in "Résumé" is different in French than it is in English, and in French, the word means "summary." The woman is saying that the man is always thinking about sex, and the man misheard her and thought she was saying that everything he says reminds her of sex.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in this particular scene, the woman with the "OUT" sign is Roger's secretary, and she is telling him that he thinks everything is about sex. The joke is clever because it is true in a way: the "IN" and "OUT" signs are usually used in a workplace to indicate when people are available or away from their desk, but in this case, they are also a visual pun for when people are "in" or "out" of a sexual relationship.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Roger, the man in the scene, is getting frustrated with his boss. His boss has just said that everything Roger does reminds him of sex, which is probably not true. However, the joke is also funny because it's true that many things can remind people of sex, even if they're not thinking about it at the time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the "IN" sign is tries to bring up something seemingly unrelated to sex, but the woman with the "OUT" sign interrupts him and says that everything reminds him of sex. This is probably true, to some extent, for most people, but it's especially true for Roger, who is fixated on sex.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one man is telling the other man that everything reminds him of sex. This is probably true for many people, but it's especially funny in this context because the men are holding signs that say "in" and "out" --- which are also terms often used in sexual contexts.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is telling his friend that everything reminds him of sex. In this case, the signs are a double-entendre: they can be interpreted both as a message on a resume that says "in" and "out" (i.e., the person is employed and looking for a new job) or as a sexual position. The fact that the man's friend is named Roger also adds a double meaning, as "roger" can also be a slang term for orgasm.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the "IN" sign is suggesting that the woman with the "OUT" sign is only thinking about sex. The joke plays on the stereotype that men are always thinking about sex, and that women are more focused on relationships.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in this particular office situation, it's true. The man with the IN sign is likely coming in for a job interview, whereas the woman with the OUT sign is likely getting fired. So, everything in the office --- the desk, the chairs, the CEO himself --- reminds the man of sex, because that's the only thing he's thinking about. The joke is a play on the idea that men are always thinking about sex.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's true: often, people in offices will try to make sex jokes, or at least, sexually-themed jokes, because it's a way to relieve the boredom of work. In this case, the man is trying to make a joke about the "IN" and "OUT" signs, but the woman is not amused.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the men,Roger, has a dirty mind. The scene is innocuous, but Roger has sexualized it by seeing phallic symbols in the signs. The joke could be seen as a comment on how men tend to sexualize everything, but it could also just be a comment on Roger's particular dirty mind.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because while, in the context of an office, the out-of-the-blue quip could be seen as a inappropriate and unwelcome sexual advance, in the context of the two people with the IN/OUT signs, it's a completely innocent and mundane statement. The humor comes from the mismatch between the two contexts.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's response to the woman's question is very non-sequitur. The woman asked him whether he put his resume on the desk, and he responded by saying that everything reminds him of sex. It's funny because it's an unexpected and inappropriate response to her question.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman with the "IN" sign is coming in to the office, and the man with the "OUT" sign is leaving the office. However, the joke also implies that the man with the "OUT" sign is leaving because he's sexualized the woman with the "IN" sign, and is thinking about having sex with her. This is a common occurrence in offices, where people are often attracted to their coworkers, but it's usually not solved by one person just leaving the office.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="165.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="167.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
