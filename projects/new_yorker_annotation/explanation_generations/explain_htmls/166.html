The word "ruff" can mean either a type ofECK neckwear or a noun meaning a disturbance or commotion. In this case, the lady's ruff is so large that it's causing a commotion, and the men looking at her are not close to her because they are standing at a distance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's comment implies that he has only ever seen the woman from a distance, and never been close enough to speak to her. This is because the woman is wearing a ruff, which was a type of collar worn in the Victorian Era that covered the neck and part of the face. The joke is a play on words, as the man says they were "never close" meaning they were never physically close, but also that they were never close friends.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "close" can mean two different things: (1) close friends or (2) close proximity. In this case, the speaker is saying that he knows the woman, but they are not close friends, because her huge collar is in the way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is saying that he knows the woman, but he's not "close" to her in the sense that they are friends. However, he is "close" to her in the sense that she is standing very close to him, given the large size of her ruff.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the ruff around the woman's neck is so large that it makes it appear as if she has a large, circular object around her neck. This, in turn, makes it appear as if the two men are very close to her, when in reality, they are not.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the ruff is a type of collar that was popular in the 16th century; it was very large and stood up around the neck. The joke is poking fun at the fact that the man knows the woman, but they are not close because the ruff is so large that it prevents them from being close to each other.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the image of the woman with the gigantic ruff around her neck is so absurd, it's as if the two men are talking about someone they don't know. The joke is also clever because "close" can mean two things: either physically close or emotionally close. In this case, the men are saying that they are not physically close to the woman because she is so far away, and they are also not emotionally close to her because they don't know her well.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the double-meaning of the word "close". In this context, "close" can mean either "near" or "intimate". The woman is not close to the speaker in terms of physical proximity, but her large ruff means that she is very close to him in terms of personal space. Thus, the joke is cleverly using the different meanings of the word "close" to create a pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's comment is a play on words. The woman is wearing a ruff, which is a collar made of fabric that stands out from the neckline of a garment. The man is saying that he knows her, but they were never "close" because the ruff is in the way. This is a clever way of saying that he doesn't really know her well, but pretends to.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman's neck frill is so large that it's considered rude to stare at her, but the speaker is saying that he knows her, suggesting he's not staring because he's rude, but because he's trying to figure out who she is. The fact that he says they were never close is a further play on words because it could either mean that they were never close friends OR that her neck frill is so large that it's preventing him from getting close to her to figure out who she is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men are staring at the woman's huge frill, which is a very noticeable and unattractive feature. The joke implies that the woman is so unattractive that the men wouldn't even want to be close to her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of the word "close." In this context, the woman is wearing a ruff, which is a large, circular collar worn around the neck. The fact that the man says they were never "close" implies that they weren't friends or didn't know each other well, but the word "close" can also mean "near." So, the joke could also be interpreted as the man saying that he knows the woman, but she is too far away for him to talk to her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the extremely large ruff around the woman's neck makes it difficult to see her face, which would be necessary for recognition. The speakers says he knows her, but because they were never "close", it's implied that he only knows her in the sense of being familiar with her, rather than being friends or family.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men are talking about the woman as if she is a giraffe, not a human being. The joke is based on the fact that the woman's neck is unnaturally long, like a giraffe's, which is why the men say they were never "close" to her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is wearing a ruff, which was a type of fabric that was popular in the 16th century. The neck part of the fabric was often very large, leading to the joke that the person is not "close" to the woman because of the large amount of fabric between them.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="165.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="167.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
