The joke is that the men in suits are going to war with the men on horses, but they will be carrying briefcases instead of guns or other weapons, which is ironic because it shows that they are not prepared for war.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the businessmen look out of place, as if they are on a business trip in the wrong era. This is a play on words, because "business" has two meanings: the activity of running a business, and the datum that something is serious. In this case, the businessmen want to be taken seriously as a threat, but their appearance only makes them look comical.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men in suits and ties look out of place leading the charge on horseback into battle. The suits and ties are modern day business attire, which is typically associated with more tame activities like meetings and paperwork, rather than the more aggressive activities of warfare. The joke is basically saying that these men in suits are going to fight in a way that shows they are serious and mean business, even though their appearance may not convey that message.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The businessmen are dressed in suits, which are often associated with "business." However, the fact that they are trailing along behind the soldiers in a time period where suits wouldn't be appropriate implies that they are there for show and aren't actually going to be doing any work. In other words, they are there to "show the enemy that we mean business," but they aren't actually going to be doing any fighting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The men on horses are going to war and the men in suits are their backup. The joke is that the men in suits are businesspeople and the joke is that they are going to war to get new clients.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men in suits and ties look out of place, as if they are from a different time period. They are following the men on horses, who look like they are from the Mongolian Empire. The men in suits and ties are carrying briefcases, which implies that they are business people. The joke is that the men in suits and ties are going to try to do business with the men on horses, who are probably not interested in business deals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men in suits are acting like they are going to war, but they are really just businesspeople. The joke is clever because it is a play on words --- "business" can mean both the occupation of being a businessperson, and it can also be used to describe the serious/threatening intent of the suits.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in this particular business, warfare, it would be highly unusual for businessmen to be involved. The joke is clever because "business" can mean both the activity of conducting business, and also a group of people involved in business. In this context, the businessmen are acting as if they are in a business meeting, but they are actually in the business of warfare.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "This time they'll know we mean business" could mean that the armed forces will be sure to defeat the enemy, and the businesspeople are backing them up. However, it could also mean that the businesspeople are going to lead the charge, and the armed forces are Backup. In either case, it's funny because the two groups seem mismatched.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The men in suits are carrying briefcases, which are often associated with business. However, in this case, the briefcases are full of guns, which suggests that they aren't going to be engaging in business negotiations, but rather are planning to engage in warfare.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "To mean business" usually signifies that someone is serious and not to be messed with. However, in this case, the men in suits actually are in the business of dressing people in armor and providing horses. Therefore, the joke is that the men on horses will be better equipped this time around because the suits are helping them, and not because the suits are trying to intimidate them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "this time they'll know we mean business". The phrase is often used to describe a situation in which someone is taking a more serious or forceful approach than they have in the past, in order to achieve a goal. In this case, the soldiers on horseback are leading a group of businessmen, which suggests that they are planning to attack or invade a business.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The soldiers are mounted on horseback, and they are carrying weapons, so they look like they mean business. However, the businessmen who are following them are also carrying weapons, and they look like they mean business too. The joke is that the businessmen are actually going to kill the soldiers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The men in suits and ties are carrying weapons and are following the men on horses, suggesting that they are going to war. However, the men in suits are also businesspeople, so the joke is that they are going to war with the intention of "taking care of business."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the businessmen are probably going to get kicked out of the country by the Mongols, who were historically a nomadic warrior people who were known for their fierceness and their lack of regard for civilian life. The joke is that the businessmen, who are generally associated with commerce and not aggression, are going to get their comeuppance from the Mongols.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
