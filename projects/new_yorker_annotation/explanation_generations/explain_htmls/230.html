Despite the fact that the situation is quite dangerous and not at all normal, the policeman is treating it like a routine traffic stop. This jokes creates humor through its juxtaposition of the expected behavior in the situation (calmness) with the actual situation (danger).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The policeman is telling the driver of the rocket to get out of the vehicle, but because the driver is in a rocket, the cop's words take on a double meaning of the driver needing to take a small step out of the rocket and onto the ground.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "I'm going to need you to take one small step out of the vehicle" is something a police officer would say to the driver of a car that he is pulling over. In this case, the "vehicle" is a giant jet, and so taking "one small step out of the vehicle" would mean taking a small step out of the jet, which would be impossible.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the policeman is going to ticket the driver for an illegal move, but the driver is clearly not in the vehicle anymore--they are in space, piloting the rocket. The policeman's request is impossible to comply with, making it humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, when a cop pulls someone over, they often say "I'm going to need you to step out of the vehicle." In this case, the cop is pulling over a rocket, which would be impossible for a person to step out of. The cop's use of standard procedure in an impossible situation is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police officer is asking the pilot to do something that is impossible given the situation: step out of the vehicle. Not only is the vehicle a giant jet, but it's also in the middle of the street, so there's no way for the pilot to actually step out.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is telling the driver of the rocket to step out of the vehicle, but in order to do so, the driver would have to take a giant step, since they are in a rocket. This goes against the usual protocol of traffic stops, where the driver is asked to step out of the vehicle so that the cop can talk to them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police officer is telling the pilot of the jet to get out of the jet, which is absurd because the pilot is hundreds of feet in the air. The officer is probably just trying to be polite, but the joke is that the request is impossible to comply with.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the policeman is asking the driver, who is still sitting in the car, to step out of the vehicle, even though there's a rocket on the ground. The policeman is using standard procedure protocol even though the situation is far from standard.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the policeman is telling the driver to step out of his vehicle as if it's a routine traffic stop, even though there is a rocket on the ground. The joke is a play on how police officers often use seemingly innocuous phrases to hide the true nature of the situation. In this case, the innocuous phrase is "one small step out of the vehicle" which is usually just a routine request, but in this context it takes on a whole new meaning because of the rocket.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the policeman is treating the situation as a normal traffic stop, even though there is a rocket on the ground. The joke is a play on the instructions policemen often give to drivers when they are pulling them over, to step out of the vehicle. In this case, the driver would need to take a much larger step out of their vehicle to get away from the rocket.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is telling the pilot of the jet to get out of the jet so he can give him a ticket. The double-meaning of "one small step" is also funny because the cop is telling the pilot to get out of the jet, but "one small step" also refers to the moon landing, which makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common phrase "take a step out of the vehicle" which police officers say to people they have pulled over. Instead of a person, the police officer ispulling over a giant jet, so the joke is that the police officer is completely overwhelmed by the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is asking the rocket driver to step out of the vehicle, but in order for the driver to do so, they would need to take a giant step, since rockets are so much taller than normal cars. The cop's request is impossible to comply with, yet perfectly reasonable in the context of a normal traffic stop.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="229.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="231.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
