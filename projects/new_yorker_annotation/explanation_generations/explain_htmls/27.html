My couch is brand new.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in most cases, when someone is in therapy, they lay on the therapist's couch, but in this case, the patient is in a bathtub. The patient is saying that he hopes the therapist doesn't mind that he is in the bathtub rather than on the couch, and the therapist likely does mind because it's not very professional.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the patient is in a bathtub, which is an unusual place to be during a therapy session. The patient says he hopes the psychiatrist doesn't mind, when in reality, it is the patient who is minding because he is the one who is doing something out of the ordinary.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The patient is in a new "couch" (a bathtub), and the therapist is making a comment about how the patient is using it (a "couch" is also a type of therapy where the patient lays on a therapist's couch and talks about their problems).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the couch is cleaning his brand new couch with a brush while the other man is in the bathtub. It's odd that the man would be cleaning his couch while the other man is in the bathtub, and it's even more odd that he would be doing it with a brush.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while a therapist's office might have a new couch, it's highly unlikely that it would have a bathtub. The patient is making a joke that because the psychiatrist's office is so new, he decided to take a bath in it to test it out. This is humorous because it's an unexpected and oddly intimate thing to do in a therapist's office.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man on the couch is not only new to the job, but he is also new to the profession (couch=counselor). The joke is also funny because it is a play on the stereotype of therapists being weird and creepy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The therapist is saying that he doesn't mind that the patient is laying in the bathtub, because he just got a new couch. But, the patient is actually in therapy, so the therapist's couch is where he is supposed to be lying down. The patient being in the bathtub is a metaphor for how he is "in over his head" with his problems, and needs help to sort them out.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because patients typically see psychiatrists while sitting on a couch, but this patient is in a bathtub. The joke is that the patient is so comfortable in the bathtub that they don't want to leave, even for the traditional psychiatric session. The joke could also be interpreted as the patient being so mentally ill that they can't even sit on a couch like a normal person.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it points out the absurdity of the scene: a man is taking a bath in the middle of a therapist's office, and the therapist is nonchalantly brushing his hair. The joke is funnier because the therapist seems more concerned about the state of his couch (which is brand new) than the fact that there is a naked man in his office.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is an example of irony. The man with the brush is implied to be the therapist, and he is making a comment about how the other man, who is in the bathtub, doesn't mind that he is sitting on the new couch. The man in the bathtub is clearly uncomfortable with the situation, which makes the therapist's comment ironic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is absurd: why would someone be taking a bath in a therapist's office? The therapist's comment implies that this is not an unusual occurrence, which makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the patient's unusual request makes it seem like he is trying to be difficult or impossible to treat. The psychiatrist is trying to be accommodating by saying that it's okay, but the patient's choice of treatment (laying in a bathtub) is still bizarre.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is unexpected that the therapist would have a tub in their office. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words; the word "couch" can mean both a piece of furniture where people can sit or lie down, or it can be a another word for therapy. In this case, the therapist is saying that the man can lie down in the tub for his therapy session.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the implication is that the patient wasn't supposed to get in the bathtub, and is now doing so anyway. The joke highlights the contrast between the expected behavior in a therapy session (sitting on the couch and talking) and the unexpected behavior (laying in a bathtub).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected that the patient would be taking a bath in the psychiatrist's office. The joke is also a play on the fact that many people believe that talking to a psychiatrist is a sign of weakness or that it means you are "crazy", when in reality most people could benefit from talking to a therapist about their problems. The patient in the bathtub is a way of indicating that they are comfortable with discussing their problems openly and are not afraid to talk about what's really going on in their life.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
