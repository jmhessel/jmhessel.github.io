They found the proof in the pudding.'</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "the proof is in the pudding." In this case, the pudding is literal, not figurative, and it's the proof of the crime (presumably, smuggling contraband into the prison). The chef is sad because he has been caught, and the woman is sad because she won't be getting her pudding fix.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The proof is in the pudding means that the evidence of something is in the outcome.

The phrase "the proof is in the pudding" means that the quality of something can be judged by its results. In this case, the pudding is the proof that the man on the other side of the window is a chef, and the proof that he is a chef is the fact that he is wearing a chef's outfit.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman has just been told by the chef that her husband has been convicted of a crime and is going to jail. The chef then says that the proof of her husband's guilt was found in the pudding, which is a play on the phrase "the proof is in the pudding." This is humorous because, while the chef is technically correct that the pudding was the proof of her husband's guilt, it is an unexpected and humorous way to phrase it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The "proof" that the woman is talking about is probably evidence linking the chef to a crime, which has been found in the "pudding" --- i.e., the dessert that the chef has prepared. The joke is clever because it uses the double meaning of the word "proof" to make a pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is sad because she has been convicted of a crime, and the chef is sad because the proof of the woman's guilt was found in the pudding he made. The pudding is a metaphor for the evidence in the case, and the fact that it was found in the pudding suggests that the chef might have known that the woman was guilty all along.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "the proof is in the pudding" means that the evidence of something is in the result of the thing. In this case, the proof that the prisoner is a chef is in the pudding, or the food, that he is preparing. However, the bad news is that the authorities have found the proof, or evidence, in the pudding, meaning that they have caught the prisoner and he will likely be going back to jail.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "the proof is in the pudding." In this case, the pudding is actually proof of the prisoner's guilt, since it is the ingredient that the chef used to poison the food. The fact that the proof is in the pudding is a humorous reversal of the saying.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "the proof is in the pudding" means that something can be confirmed by its results. In this case, the "pudding" is the chef's food, and the "proof" is the food that the Chef made that contained the drugs that the woman was trying to smuggle into the prison.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "bad news" is a pun on the phrase "baked goods." The phrase "proof in the pudding" is a pun on the phrase "proof is in the pudding." The chef is telling the woman that the evidence against her is clear, and she is going to be convicted.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "the proof is in the pudding" means that the evidence of something is in its results. In this case, the woman is the pudding, and the chef is the one who put the proof (the drugs) in her. The fact that he's a chef is also relevant because it's another play on words: the phrase "to bake a cake" can also mean to do something sneaky or underhanded.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the phrase "the proof is in the pudding" means that the quality of something can be judged by its results. In this case, the proof that the man is a chef is in the pudding, which he is holding up to the window. The woman is telling him that the proof is not good enough, because he has been caught and is now in prison.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "the proof is in the pudding" means that the validity of something can be seen through its results. In this case, the man has been caught because the proof (of his crime) was found in the pudding (that he made).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The "proof" the woman is talking about is probably proof of the chef's guilt in a crime, but the chef mishears her and thinks she is talking about the pudding. This is a double meaning of the word "proof," which can refer both to evidence of something and to the alcohol content of a drink.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words.

The play on words is funny because it is a pun on the phrase "the proof is in the pudding", which means that you can tell if something is good by trying it (in this case, the pudding is the chef's food, and the proof that it is good is that it led to his capture).</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="26.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="28.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
