The word "recount" can mean to recount votes (as in, to make sure the vote count is correct), but it can also mean to tell a story again. In this case, the sheep are telling the story of how they were chased by the wolves, but every time they try to recount it, they fall asleep. This is probably because they are bored of telling the story, or because they are sleepy from running away from the wolves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "recount" is both a count of votes (which the ship are doing) and also a term for when election results are close and so a new vote is taken (which the ship are also doing).
