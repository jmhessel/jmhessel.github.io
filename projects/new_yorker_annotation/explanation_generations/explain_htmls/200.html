This is a play on the fact that many people in the business world are under a lot of financial pressure and have to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The financial difficulties the company is facing is causing the board members to have to do extra work, just like the window washers outside. But instead of saying they are "washing windows," they are "scaffolding." So the joke is that they are taking on an extra job to make ends meet, just like the window washers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "duties" can mean both responsibilities that someone has at their job, as well as the act of urinating. So, the joke is that the board members are so poor that they have to take on extra jobs, even jobs that involve urinating in public.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the window washers are doing something that they normally wouldn't do, which is spying on the business meeting. The joke is clever because it turns the financial difficulties of the company into a joke by saying that the board members have taken on additional duties, such as being window washers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the window washers are literally watching the board members, who are now having to do additional work to save money. The joke is clever because it plays on the double meaning of "board" as both a group of people who make decisions for a company, and a physical surface that one can stand on to watch something.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: "board members" can refer to the directors of a company who sit on a "board", but it can also refer to the physical boards that make up the walls of a room. In this case, the cleaning crew are "board members" in the latter sense, and they have been drafted into service to clean the windows. The joke is clever because it's both a physical and a figurative way of looking at the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "board" can mean a group of people who make decisions, or it can mean a physical board that you write on. In this case, the board members are literally standing on a board (the scaffold), and they are also the group of people making decisions (in the boardroom). So the joke is that they are doing two things at once, which is a play on the phrase "to have your cake and eat it too."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually when business meetings occur, the participants are focused on the meeting itself and not on the people outside the window. In this case, the window washers are so close to the meeting that they can hear what's going on, and because of the company's financial difficulties, some of the board members have had to take on additional duties, like being window washers. The contrast between the serious business meeting and the mundane task of window washing makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "board" can mean a team of people who work together, or it can mean a physical surface, like the surface of a table. In this case, the board members are taking on additional duties, but they are also being forced to clean windows, which is a more literal interpretation of the word "board."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the window washers are observing the business meeting and it's revealed that some of the board members have taken on the job of window washing in order to make ends meet. The contrast between the formal setting of the boardroom and the revelation that some of the participants have taken on low-status jobs to make money is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The window washers are outside the window, and they are 'watching' the board members, but they are also 'watching' the board members in the sense that they are monitoring their meeting. The joke is clever because it is a double meaning that is only revealed after a moment of consideration.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cleaning crew is acting like they are going to raid the board meeting and take it over, but in reality they are just there to clean the windows. The joke is a play on words, as the phrase "taken on additional duties" can mean either being given more responsibilities at work, or taking on a second job to make ends meet. In this case, the cleaning crew has "taken on additional duties" by becoming window cleaners in addition to their other jobs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The cleaning crew is actually a security detail, posing as cleaning crew in order to blend in and protect the board members in the meeting. The joke is that the financial difficulties the company is facing is so dire that even the board members have to take on additional duties, like cleaning the windows.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the window washers are doing something they normally wouldn't do, which is watch the business meeting. The joke makes fun of the financial difficulties of the company by implying that the window washers are so poor that they have to watch the business meeting in order to understand what is going on.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the window washers being in the boardroom is unexpected and out of place. The joke is also clever because it explains why the window washers would be interested in the board meeting: because some of the board members have taken on additional duties, including window washing, due to financial difficulties.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="199.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="201.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
