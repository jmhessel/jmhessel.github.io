The joke is clever because it makes a play on words with "cholesterol" and "shlemesterol."

The chef in the coffin is named André, and the speaker is saying that he loved to say "cholesterol, shlemesterol." The first part of the phrase is a medical term for a type of fat found in the blood, and the second part is a play on the word "cholesterol" that sounds like it means the same thing. However, the second part of the phrase is actually nonsense, which makes the whole thing funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is suggesting that the chef, who is in a coffin, died from eating too much cholesterol.
