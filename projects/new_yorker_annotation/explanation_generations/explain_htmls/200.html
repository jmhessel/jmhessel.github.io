<p style="text-align:center;"><img src=https://jmh-public.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/capcon/all_newyorker/all_new_yorker_images_v2/bob_okay/contest_590.jpg></img></p><p style="text-align:center;font-size:30px">Sure, drawing it is the easy part, it's the caption that's tough.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cartoonist is suggesting that the lizard's drawing would be good enough to be published in the New Yorker, but the real challenge would be coming up with a witty caption. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words --- the lizard is "drawing" on the cave wall, but the cartoonist is suggesting that the lizard needs to "write" a caption.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the reptile is not really good at drawing, but is just copying the paintings that the cavemen have already made. The joke is also a play on the common saying, "it's not easy being green", which is often used to describe the feeling of being different. In this case, the reptile is different because it is a prehistoric reptile, but it is also different because it is trying to do something that it is not good at.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lizard is trying to communicate through drawing on the cave wall, which is a very difficult task. The fact that the lizard is having trouble with the caption implies that the drawing is likely not very good, making the joke funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is true: drawings, even of complex things, can be done by anyone, but it is coming up with a clever or witty caption that is often more difficult. In this case, the joke is made funnier by the fact that the dinosaur is drawing horses and cavemen, which implies that he does not understand what he is drawing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it takes the perspective of the caveman who is surprised that the reptile is able to draw. He implies that the reptile must have had trouble with the written language aspect of the cave painting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the cavemen is saying that the part of the lizard's drawing that is most difficult is the caption, which is ironic because, without opposable thumbs, the lizard wouldn't be able to write a caption in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The reptile is happy because it justfinished drawing a picture, but the cavemen are upset because they think the reptile is trying to make a fool of them. The reptile is actually happy because it just finished the drawing, not because it tricked the cavemen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because while the reptile is doing something impossible (painting), the cavemen are worried about the easy part, the drawing. The captioning is the difficult part because it's hard to come up with a funnily accurate description of the drawing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is true: often, the hardest part about creating a good painting or drawing is coming up with an appropriate caption that goes with it. In this case, the dinosaurs' drawings are extra funny because they are so ridiculous: a dinosaur wouldn't be able to draw horses or cavemen, let alone come up with a caption for them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at the commonality of people mis-attributing cave paintings to dinosaurs. dinosaurs did not exist during the time when cave paintings were made, so it's impossible for them to have made the paintings. The joke also playfully suggests that the reptile might be a better artist than the cavemen, who cannot seem to figure out how to draw a simple picture.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the cavemen is trying to explain to the other why the lizard might be having a hard time. He says that drawing the picture is the easy part, it's coming up with a caption for the drawing that's tough. This is clever because it's true --- hieroglyphs often had captions accompanying them, and writing a caption is indeed harder than just drawing a picture.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's implying that the lizard is trying to communicate through his drawing, but he's having trouble because he can't write a caption. This is difficult because he can't write, which is a skill that requires opposable thumbs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it takes the impossible scenario of a reptile creating cave paintings and makes it even more absurd by adding the element of the reptile having to come up with a caption for the painting. The joke is clever because it playfully addresses the challenge of creating a good caption for a piece of art, which can often be difficult.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is true: often, the hardest part of coming up with a cartoon or drawing is not the drawing itself, but coming up with a clever or funny caption to go along with it. In this case, the dinosaur's drawing is made even funnier because it is an impossible scene --- a dinosaur cannot draw horses and cavemen because they did not live at the same time. The joke highlights the absurdity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "caption" can refer to both the text underneath a drawing (in a cartoon, for example) or a title for a drawing. In this case, the lizard is having trouble coming up with a caption for his drawing, which is why the cavemen are spying on him.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="199.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="201.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
