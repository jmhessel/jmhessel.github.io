The woman coming out from under the judge's podium is his wife, and she's mad because he's brought work home with him again. But, in this case, the work is literally a trial that he's presiding over in court.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The usual idiom is "I hate it when you bring your work home with you." In this case, the work is a clown, who literally came out of the judge's desk. This is confusing and unexpected, which is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman in the robe is angry because the person living in the courtroom has brought work home with them, i.e., they have brought their job (as a lawyer or judge) into the home, and she does not like it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the clown coming out of the desk is clearly not supposed to be there. The clown is interrupting the trial to complain about the judge bringing work home, which is a relatable topic, but an odd thing to say in this context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The speaker is saying that he hates it when people bring their work problems home with them, but in this case, the person who has brought their work home is the clown. The clown is usually associated with happiness and laughter, but in this case, it is causing confusion and disruption in the courtroom.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Judge's chambers are usually a separate room in the courthouse, where the Judge can work undisturbed. But in this case, the chambers are apparently the judge's home, and the lawyer and witness are interrupting the judge's home life. The joke pokes fun at how some people can't seem to separate their work life from their home life.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the clown popping out of the desk is disruptive to the proceedings of the trial, and the speaker is complaining about how the clown is making his work (the trial) harder by being there. The speaker is also annoyed because, presumably, the clown is there because of the speaker's work (the trial) and not because the clown just wanted to come to the trial.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman in the robe is angry because the person living in the courtroom is disrupting her work (at home, she presumably doesn't have to deal with people living in her courtroom). The joke is clever because it's a way of saying that the person living in the courtroom is a pain in the neck, or a nuisance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman in the robe is a judge, and she is angry because the person living in the courtroom has brought work home with them. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the person has brought their work "home" to the courtroom, which is literally where they work.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the typical understanding of a "work-life balance" is that one's job shouldn't interfere too much with one's personal life. In this case, the judge has literally brought their work home: their chambers are in their home, and the lawyer and witness are there, too. This joke points to the ways that work can often invade and intrude on one's personal life, even when one tries to keep them separate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of the word "work": in a normal scenario, work is something that one does at an office, away from home. However, in this context, the judge is bringing her work (i.e., the court case) home with her, literally, as the person in the courtroom is living in her house.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the clown is interrupting the trial to complain about his job. The fact that he's a clown and came out of the judge's desk is unexpected and makes the joke funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman in the robe is angry because the man in the courtroom is clearly not a judge, and yet he is wearing a robe, as if he is pretending to be a judge. She is angry because he is bringing his work home with him, and she doesn't want him to do that. The joke is clever because it's both a play on words and a play on the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the clown coming out of the judge's desk is disrupting the trial, and the man's comment is a non sequitur. The joke is clever because it makes a play on the phrase "to bring work home with you", which usually refers to taking work home to complete outside of normal work hours. In this case, the work (the clown) is literally coming home with the judge.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "work" that the judge is bringing home is a case, or more likely, a defendant in a case. The joke here is that the defendant is literally being brought home by the judge, which is highly unusual. This would be the defendant's worst nightmare, as they would be facing the consequences of their actions in the most intimate setting, their home.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="244.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="246.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
