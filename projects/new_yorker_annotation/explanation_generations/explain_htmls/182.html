The phrase "monkeying around" is often used to describe people who are playing around or acting silly, and in this situation, there are actual monkeys present, doing just that. The woman's response is clever because it's a non-answer to the man's question --- instead of saying what she wants, she just tells him to stop being so difficult.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a dark twist on a typical birthday scenario. In this case, the woman is so upset about the mess the monkeys are making that she doesn't want to celebrate her birthday anymore --- which is the complete opposite of what usually happens.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is asking her husband what he wants for his birthday, and he responds by saying that he doesn't care, which is something that people often say when they don't know what they want or when they don't want to make a decision. However, in this context, the husband's response is humorous because he is literally surrounded by monkeys, which makes it clear that he does care about something.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is saying that the monkey is making a mess, and the man replies that maybe she should just be direct and tell him what she wants for her birthday instead of saying she doesn't care. This is humorous because it's an inversion of the common situations: usually it's the man who doesn't know what to get the woman for her birthday, and she has to give him hints.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman on the couch is saying that the monkey is causing mischief, but the man on the couch misunderstands and thinks she's saying she doesn't care about his birthday. This is funny because it's a reversal of the common misunderstanding where men are accused of not caring about anniversaries or birthdays.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman on the couch is saying that she doesn't care what the man gets her for her birthday, but the man hears this as "monkey," because there are so many monkeys in the room. He thinks she's saying that she wants a monkey for her birthday, when in reality, she just doesn't care what he gets her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the situation: there are monkeys in the living room, yet the woman is more worried about what gift to get her husband for his birthday than the fact that there are monkeys in the room. Thisshows that she is more concerned with the gift, and what he wants, than with the monkeys, which points to the fact that she may not be as worried about him as he is about her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man on the couch is saying that since the woman doesn't know what she wants, maybe she should just tell him what she wants for her birthday. However, the word "care" can also be a homophone for "monkey," which is what the rest of the sentence is about. In other words, the man is saying that since the woman doesn't know what type of monkey she wants (i.e., she doesn't know what she wants), maybe she should just tell him what she wants for her birthday instead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is trying to placate the woman by suggesting that she just tell him what she wants for her birthday instead of getting mad about the monkeys in the living room. However, the fact that there are monkeys in the living room is a metaphor for the fact that the woman is pregnant: the monkeys are a symbol for the upcoming baby, and the man is trying to suggest that instead of getting mad about the situation, the woman should just be direct about what she wants.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is making a joke about the woman's birthday being a monkey-themed surprise party. The joke is clever because it's a play on words --- instead of saying "I don't want a surprise party," the woman said she doesn't want a "surprise," which the man then takes to mean that she wants a party with monkeys.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is trying to get the man to give her a hint about what he wants for his birthday, but he insists he doesn't care. However, the fact that there are monkeys all over the room implies that he actually does care about something --- he wants a monkey. The woman's sarcastic remark is thus humorous because it's true: he should just tell her what he wants instead of pretending he doesn't care.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "a monkey on your back" is often used to describe a stressful burden that someone is carrying around. In this case, the woman has an actual monkey on her back, which is a situation that would be very stressful. The man is trying to defuse the situation by joking that she should just tell him what she wants for her birthday instead of saying she doesn't care.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "going bananas"; in this case, the woman is saying that her husband is "going bananas" because he is surrounded by monkeys. The phrase "going bananas" is often used to describe someone who is acting erratically or is otherwise out of control.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman on the couch is asking the man what he wants for his birthday, and he responds by saying he doesn't care. However, the woman is literalminded and interprets this to mean that he doesn't want anything, when in reality he just doesn't want to make any decisions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is saying that she doesn't care what the man gets her for her birthday, but the man interprets this to mean that she actually does want him to get her a gift, and so he should just ask her directly what she wants. The monkeys in the room are there to add to the surreal atmosphere of the situation and to reinforce the idea that the woman's birthday is coming up soon.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="181.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="183.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
