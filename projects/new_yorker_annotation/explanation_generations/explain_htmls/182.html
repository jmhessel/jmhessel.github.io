It's your call, honey.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The judge is asking the person in the courtroom if they want "swift justice" or "cold pancakes". "Swift justice" is a phrase meaning that the person wants their case to be heard and decided quickly. "Cold pancakes" is a phrase meaning that the person wants their pancakes to be cold. In this case, the judge is asking the person if they want their case to be decided quickly or if they want their pancakes to be cold.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is unexpectedly coming out of the bottom of the judge's podium, and she is so angry that she is offering the person two options: either "swift justice" or "cold pancakes." The pancakes are cold because she has been underneath the podium for so long.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Swift justice" is a term often used to describe how quickly the justice system can act, whereas "cold pancakes" is a term used to describe how unappetizing cold food can be. In this case, the joke is saying that the person can either have justice that is quick but may not be satisfying, or they can have something that is satisfying (pancakes) but may not be quick.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="181.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="183.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
