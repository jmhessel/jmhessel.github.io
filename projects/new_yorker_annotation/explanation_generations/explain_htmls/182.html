The joke is a play on the idea that people who are texting are not paying attention to their surroundings, and thus, are not aware of danger. In this case, the danger is a large whale landing on top of them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the whale is beached and stuck on the island. It is a metaphor for how someone can be so busy texting that they do not pay attention to their surroundings and end up in a sticky situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to how humans often get distracted by their phones and fail to pay attention to their surroundings. In this case, the whale beached itself because it was not paying attention to where it was swimming and got stranded on the small island. The joke is a play on how humans are not the only ones who can get distracted by technology.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man who is under the whale is saying that he's sorry for not paying attention, and that's why he got stranded on the island. However, the word "texting" can also refer to the act of sending a text message, which is how the man got stranded on the island in the first place --- he was too busy sending a text message to notice that he was about to walk into a whale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at how texting and phone addiction has become such aproblem that even a whale can be distracted by it and accidentally beach itself on a small island.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The whale is "texting," as in, sending a message via the WhatsApp messaging app. However, the whale is also "texting" in the sense that it's belly-flopping on top of a person, squishing them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "texting" can mean sending a text message on a phone, but it can also mean writing in a text, like a book. In this case, the whale was "texting" by beaching himself on the small island; he didn't see the island because he was too busy looking at his phone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The whale is "beached" on the island, which means it's stuck there and can't move. But "beached" also sounds like "bleached," as in, the whale is so pale because it's been sunbathing. The joke is that the whale is stuck on the island because it was too busy texting to notice that it was swimming too close to shore.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the whale is beached on an island that is too small, and the implication is that the whale is texting and not paying attention to where it is going. The joke is clever because it is a play on words --- the whale is "beached" (stuck on land) because it was "texting" (using its phone) and not paying attention.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common saying "sorry, I was distracted." In this case, instead of being distracted by something like a phone call or a person walking by, the whale was distracted by its own texting. This is a play on the fact that whales are often more intelligent than humans, and thus are capable of activities like texting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the whale is beached on the island, and is probably going to die. The whale is texting and not paying attention to its surroundings, which is how it ended up in this predicament. The joke is also a play on the common problem of people texting and not paying attention to their surroundings, which can often lead to accidents.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who is beached underneath the whale is saying that they are sorry for not paying attention, implying that this is a common occurrence. The joke is funny because it is a play on the "sorry for your loss" trope, but in a situation that is bizarre and unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the person under the whale is presumably dead, the other person's nonchalant attitude implies that this is a common occurrence on the island, and that the person who is responsible for the death is not taking it seriously. The joke suggests that the person who was texting is more concerned about their phone than the life of the other person.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The human who is trapped underneath the whale is apologizing for not paying attention, and thus being in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, the fact that he was texting suggests that he was distracted, and not paying attention to his surroundings, which is why he didn't see the whale until it was too late.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the recent phenomena of "whale texting", where people have gotten in trouble for texting while driving and crashing into whales. The whale in this situation is beached on the island, and the implication is that the person who was texting while driving, crashed into the whale, causing it to be beached.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="181.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="183.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
