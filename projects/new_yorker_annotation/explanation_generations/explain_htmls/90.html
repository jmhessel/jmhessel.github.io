However, in this case, the banana peel is the one who is feeling uncomfortable, and the therapist is suggesting that the banana peel lie down on the floor, which is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The therapist is not asking the banana peel if it would feel more comfortable on the floor because it is a peel, but rather, because the banana peel is yellow and may feel uncomfortable being the only yellow thing in the room. The therapist is also indicating that she is aware that the banana peel is not a human, and is therefore not in need of therapy, but is trying to be accommodating nonetheless.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The therapist is asking the banana peel if it would feel more comfortable on the floor, which is a normal question to ask a person who is sitting in a chair. However, the fact that the banana peel is not a person, and is inanimate, makes the question funny. The therapist is unaware that the banana peel cannot understand or answer her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is treating the banana peel like it is a person. She is asking it questions and trying to get it to open up about how it feels. She is even offering to let it sit on the floor if that would make it more comfortable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common phrase "peeling back the layers." In this case, the therapist is trying to help the banana peel "unpeel" or understand its feelings, by asking it to move to the floor (which is a common position for people to sit in during therapy sessions). The joke is also funny because it's a play on the fact that banana peels are often thrown on the ground, which is where they end up when they are peeled.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it play on the therapist's attempt to be professional and accommodating to her patients. However, since the patient is a banana peel, the therapist's efforts are futile. The therapist's suggestion to move to the floor is also amusing because it is a common position for therapists to sit on the floor with their patients, but in this case, it would just be the therapist talking to a banana peel on the floor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in order for the therapist to be talking to the banana peel, she would have to be taking it as a patient seriously. The therapist would not need to ask the banana peel if it would be more comfortable on the floor if she was not taking the situation seriously.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on a common question therapists ask their patients: "How do you feel about lying down on the couch?" In this case, the therapist is talking to a banana peel, which can't lie down, so she instead suggests the floor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. When someone sees a therapist, they are usually advised to lie down on the couch. In this case, the psychiatrist asks if the banana would feel more comfortable on the floor, which is a less common place for bananas. The joke is clever because it is a play on words that also makes a comment on the absurdity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is taking the session with the banana peel seriously, even though it is an inanimate object. The therapist is trying to be considerate of the "patient" by asking if it would be more comfortable on the floor, even though the banana peel cannot answer.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because therapists often ask their patients if they are comfortable on the couch, and the banana peel is a play on the common trope of people slipping on banana peels. In this case, the therapist is asking if the banana would feel more comfortable on the floor, implying that the banana is her patient.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is trying to be accommodating to the banana peel, which clearly does not need or want therapy, by offering it a spot on the floor instead of in the chair. This would be a normal thing to do for a human patient, but the fact that the therapist is treating the banana peel as if it is a person is what makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the psychiatrist is trying to be helpful, but the patient is not there. The joke could also be interpreted as the psychiatrist trying to be helpful to the banana, which would be even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The therapist is asking the banana peel if it would feel more comfortable on the floor, but the word "comfortable" can also mean "at ease" or "relaxed." In other words, the therapist is asking the banana peel if it would feel more relaxed on the floor, which is a silly question because banana peels are inanimate objects.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is talking to a banana peel as if it is a person. The banana peel cannot respond to the therapist, so the therapist offers to move to the floor so that the banana peel will be more comfortable.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="89.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="91.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
