The scientists are observing the mice, and one of them says that they should "slowly lower in the grant money." This could mean that they should lower the amount of money that they give to the mice (i.e., their grant), or it could mean that they should slowly lower a bag of money into the tank so that the mice can grab it. Either way, it's a funny play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words; the scientists are lowering money into the tank for the mice, but they are also "lowering in" the money in the sense that they are decreasing the amount of money they are giving to the mice. This is because the money is a grant, which is a type of financial aid that is often given with the expectation that it will be used for a specific purpose. In this case, the scientists are using the money to fund their research, which is presumably why the mice are wearing lab coats and carrying clipboards.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The scientists are observing the mice, and one of them says that they should lower the grant money slowly. This is a pun because "grant" can refer to either money given for a specific purpose (such as research) or to a large animal (such as a mouse). Thus, the joke is that they are considering lowering a mouse into the tank to see how the other mice will react.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="89.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="91.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
