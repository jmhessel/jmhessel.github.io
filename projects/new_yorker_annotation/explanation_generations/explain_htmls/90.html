This meeting is still boring.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is unexpected. The nudity is unexpected and makes the meeting more interesting, but the person still finds the meeting boring, suggesting that even with the addition of nudity, the content of the meeting is still not interesting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the saying "I told you so". In this case, the person is saying that they were wrong about the meeting being interesting because it is still boring even though everyone is naked. The joke is also funny because it is unexpected; one would not expect people to be naked in a meeting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the saying "naked truth." In this case, the "naked truth" is that the meeting is boring, even though everyone is literally naked. The joke also pokes fun at the fact that people often get naked in order to "let it all hang out" and be more honest with each other, but in this case, it's not leading to more honest or interesting conversation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the saying "there's nothing new under the sun." In this instance, the sun is literally everything because everyone is nude and there are no clothes to provide newness. Even though this meeting has the unusual circumstance of everyone being naked, the speaker still finds it boring, just like every other meeting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is so absurd. The fact that the people are naked makes it even more absurd, and thus funnier. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the common saying "I was wrong, this is not what I expected" --- in this case, the speaker expected the meeting to be boring, and it turns out that it is, even though it's taking place in an unexpected setting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because even though the situation is abnormal (people being naked in a meeting), the person still says that the meeting is boring, which is a very normal thing to say about meetings. The joke is poking fun at the fact that meetings are often seen as dull and unproductive, even when the circumstances are unusual.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that meetings are often seen as being boring. The fact that the people in the meeting are naked makes the joke even funnier, because it's unexpected and adds an element of absurdity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is naked, so he's "bare" (i.e., he has no clothes on), and he's also "bare" (i.e., he's not wearing a suit). The joke is that the man had assumed that the meeting would be more interesting because everyone would be naked, but it's still boring.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who made the statement implies that they thought that perhaps the meeting might be more interesting if the participants were naked, but they were wrong, and it's still boring. This is a play on the idea that "sex sells" or that people are often more interested in things that are sexual in nature.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the situation of the meeting has changed (everyone is now naked), the speaker still says that the meeting is boring. This implies that, even though the nakedness is unexpected, it doesn't make the meeting any more interesting. The joke is funny because it's a play on the expectations of what would make a meeting more interesting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully subverts the stereotype of business meetings as being dry, formal, and boring. In this case, the addition of nudity does not make the meeting any more interesting, according to the speaker. The joke could also be interpreted as a comment on the superfluousness of clothing in most business meetings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idea that "clothing makes the man." In other words, the fact that the people in the meeting are naked does not make the meeting any more interesting. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the phrase "there's nothing to see here," often said when there's something weird or unexpected going on. In this case, the fact that there's a bunch of naked people in the meeting is unexpected, but there's "nothing to see" because they're just naked people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on thecommon saying "I was wrong, this meeting is productive." The joke highlights the contrast between the two words "productive" and "boring" by adding in the element of nudity, which is usually reserved for activities like going to the beach, not for work meetings. The joke is clever because it's a play on words that also requires a bit of mental gymnastics to understand.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the saying "I was wrong, this meeting is boring." The twist is that instead of the meeting being boring because it's tedious/long, it's boring because everyone is naked and there's nothing to look at.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because even though the meeting attendees are now naked, the speaker still finds the meeting to be boring. This is a play on the saying "there's nothing new under the sun," which means that everything that can happen, has happened before. In this case, even though the situation is new (i.e., everyone is naked), it's still boring.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
