The bull is probably there because it's looking for a mate, but it's not going to find one at the bar. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words --- "stud service" can refer to a service provided by a male animal to mate with a female animal, but it can also refer to a service provided by a human to have sex with someone else.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the person the bartender is going to call is the owner of the bar (Ted) and that the person who is going to answer the phone is willing to have sex with animals ( Ted's Stud Service). This is a play on the fact that some bars have a "Bouncer" or "Doorman" who checks ID's and keeps out unruly customers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while a bull stud service is a real thing, it's usually not something that you would order at a bar. The bull in the bar is ordering a drink, and when the bartender asks for his name, he joking says that he'll take the Ted's Stud Service instead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "take it": in a normal scenario, if someone offers you a drink, you "take it" by accepting the drink. However, in this context, the bull is sitting at a bar and offering his services as a stud, i.e., he is offering to mate with a female cow. The bartender is looking back at the bull because it's strange to see a bull in a bar, and the guy next to the bull is making a joke about how he would "take" the offer of a drink if it were offered to him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all." In this case, the speaker is saying that if the only way he can get a drink is by sleeping with the bartender, he'll take it. The joke is also funny because it's unexpected; usually bulls are associated with being virile, not with being gay.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "stud service." In the context of a bar, "stud service" is a term for bartenders who serve drinks (i.e., they are "on the clock"). However, in the context of a bull, "stud service" refers to a bull bred for breeding, i.e., to impregnate cows. The bull is saying that if the bartenders want him to breed, he'll do it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull is at a bar and he's ordering a drink, and he's sitting next to a guy, which is a normal thing for people to do at a bar. But bulls can't sit at bars and order drinks, so the joke is that the bull is pretending to be a guy, and if someone asks him for Ted's Stud Service, he'll take it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The bull at the bar is hoping to get "served" drinks, but the bartender is going to call "Ted's Stud Service" to deal with the animal. "Stud Service" is a term often used for breeding animals, especially bulls, so the joke is that the bull is hoping to get drinks, but will instead get used for breeding.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull is talking to the bartender about a situation in which the customer asks for a specific service that the bull is not qualified to provide. The bull is saying that if the customer asks for Ted's Stud Service, he will pretend to be Ted and provide the service, even though he is not qualified.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "Ted" in "Ted's Stud Service" is likely a reference to the bull, who is sitting at the bar. The bull-man is saying that he will take the throne if it's offered to him, which is a play on the fact that bulls are often used for breeding purposes because of their virility.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a bull is a male cow, and "stud service" is a term often used for breeding. In this context, the bull is offering to mate with the female bartender, which is a humorous play on the fact that bulls are often seen as being aggressive and virile.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because bulls are often used for stud services, which is a service where the bull mates with a female animal to create offspring. The bull in the bar is saying that if the bartender asks for his stud service, he will take it, meaning he will mate with the female animal. The joke is funny because it is unexpected and because it is a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The bull is at a bar, so the phrase "stud service" could refer to ordering a drink, or it could refer to a service that bulls provide (i.e., reproducing). The bull is saying that if someone asks for the latter, he will provide it, even though it's probably not what they're expecting or wanting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull-man is offering to take on a job that is usually meant for a human being: in this case, being a "stud service" for another bull. This is a type of job that often requires intimate contact with another animal, and so it's humorous to imagine a bull taking on this type of job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of the term "stud service." In the context of the bar, "stud service" would refer to a service that Ted (the bull) provides to the other patrons of the bar (likely sexual in nature). However, the term can also refer to the breeding of animals, which is what Ted is actually in the business of.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
