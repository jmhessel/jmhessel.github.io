The couple is discussing how their parents will disapprove of their relationship because they are from different religious backgrounds. However, in this case, the difference is not between two humans, but between a human and a bee.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man's head being in a beehive implies that he is part of a colony or community (much like how bees live in hives), and the woman being a Wasp also implies that she is part of a colony or community (Wasps are a type of insect). The joke cleverly combines these two concepts to create a situation where the man's head being in a beehive is not seen as odd, because they are both part of colonies.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. In this scenario, the woman is a "Wasp" (an acronym for "White Anglo-Saxon Protestant") and the man is Jewish. However, the fact that the man has his head in a beehive changes the meaning of the word "Wasp": instead of referring to his religion, it now refers to the fact that he is literally a wasp, or a bee. This change in meaning is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that people from different religious backgrounds won't approve of their children marrying each other. In this case, the woman is peering out of the beehive, which is analogous to coming out of the closet, and the stunned reaction of the man implies that he didn't know she was Jewish.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that wasps build nests and bees build hives. In this case, the man is inside the beehive, which would typically be the home of bees, not wasps. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the stereotype that Jews and WASPs (White Anglo-Saxon Protestants) don't get along. In this case, the woman is Jewish and the man is a WASP, and they are both literally insects.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is staring at the man's head in the beehive, which is a type of hive that is made out of wax. The man is a wasp, which is a type of insect that lives in hives. The woman is staring at the man's head, which is in a hive, because she is Jewish and he is a Wasp. The joke is clever because it is a play on the two different meanings of the word "hive."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that wasps are a type of insect, and Jewish people are sometimes called " semitic." In this case, the woman is a wasp, and the man is Jewish, so their parents wouldn't approve of them dating because they're different religions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because inter-faith marriages were once taboo, and even now can be difficult. The woman in the scene is looking at the man in the beehive with a mix of shock, horror, and possibly attraction. The fact that they come from different religious backgrounds is the source of the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the stereotype that Jews and Wasps (white Anglo-Saxon Protestants) do not get along. The situation is made even more absurd by the fact that the man is literally inside a beehive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common phrase "He's a Wasp and I'm a Jew," which is used to describe people from different cultures who are in a relationship. In this case, the woman is literally a wasp (a type of bee), and the man is literally a Jew (someone with a Judaism), which is a play on the common phrases. The fact that they are both insects makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "wasp": in the context of the scene, a wasp is a type of bee that lives in a hive. However, the other meaning of "wasp" is a derogatory term for a white, Anglo-Saxon Protestant. Thus, the joke is cleverly implying that the woman is not interested in the man because he is of a different religion.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is looking at a beehive with a man's face peeking out, and she says that their parents won't approve because she is Jewish and he is a Wasp. The word "wasp" can mean a type of insect, or it can be a derogatory term for a white person of Protestant heritage. In this case, it is a play on both meanings, as the man is literally an insect (a bee) and he is also of a different religion than the woman.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is staring at the man's head in the beehive because she is shocked, and the man is Jewish. The joke is that the woman is a WASP, which stands for "White Anglo-Saxon Protestant," and Jewish people are often not considered WASPs. Therefore, the joke is that their parents wouldn't approve of them dating because they are from two different groups.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the words "Jewish" and "Wasp". In this case, the woman is Jewish and the man is a Wasp, which are two different types of bees. The joke is clever because it not only uses the two different types of bees to make a pun, but it also uses the fact that beehives are often associated with kosher food.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common phrase "you're not my type." In this case, the woman is saying that she can't date the man because he's "a Wasp" (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant), and she's Jewish. The fact that the man is stuck in a beehive adds an absurd and visual element to the joke.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="12.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="14.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
