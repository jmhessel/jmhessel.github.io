Tsunamis are usually caused by earthquakes, but in this case, the moon's gravitational pull has caused the water in the pool to rise up and create a tsunami. The man's comment about the house being too close to the moon is a play on the saying "too close for comfort," meaning that the house is so close to the moon that it's now in danger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the tsunami in the pool is caused by the moon, which is a natural celestial body, whereas the usual cause of a tsunami is an earthquake, which is an unnatural event. The man in the joke is saying that he told the woman that the house they bought was too close to the moon, which caused the natural disaster, and she didn't listen to him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the tsunami is an impossible event, and the man's explanation for it is equally absurd. The man blames the tsunami on the house being too close to the moon, as if the gravitational pull of the moon could cause a tsunami. This is, of course, nonsense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the fact that the man and woman are sitting next to a pool from which a tsunami is coming. The man says that he told the woman the house was too close to the moon, which is a completely unrelated event to the tsunami, but the woman likely won't be able to think straight because of the impending disaster.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the scene says that the house is too close to the moon, which could be interpreted as meaning that it's too close to the source of the tsunami. However, it could also be interpreted as meaning that the house is too close to the moon in general, which is why there is a tsunami coming out of the pool.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the tsunami in the pool is caused by the tides, which are caused by the moon. The man says that he told the woman that the house they bought was too close to the moon, indicating that he knew that this would happen. The woman, presumably, did not believe the man when he said this, making the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's comment makes it seem like he was expecting the tsunami. In reality, the tsunami is there because the moon is too close to the house, which is a highly improbable event. The joke is a play on the fact that the man's expectations were wrong.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man says something that is obviously not true. The woman says that the tsunami came from the moon, and the man replies that he told her the house was too close to the moon. Of course, the house has nothing to do with the tsunami, which only heightens the humor of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man says that he told the woman that the house was too close to the moon, which is the cause of the tsunami. Of course, the moon is not actually capable of causing a tsunami, but the man's comment is still funny because it's a non-sensical way to try and explain the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the tsunami is usually caused by a seismic event, which displacement of water would then result in a large wave (a tsunami). However, in this instance, the tsunami was caused by the moon, which is usually considered to be too far away to have any effect on Earth's water. The joke is a play on the fact that, while the moon is usually considered too far away to have an effect, in this instance, it is close enough to cause a tsunami.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman says that the tsunami is due to the moon's gravitational pull, which is a scientific explanation for why tsunamis happen. However, the fact that the tsunami is coming out of their pool rather than the ocean implies that the woman's explanation is incorrect. The man's response is a way of calling her out on her incorrect explanation, while also dressing it up as a joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the moon is often cited as the reason for various abnormal things happening, like tides and werewolf transformations. In this case, the tsunami in the pool is similarly attributed to the moon, despite the more logical explanation being a seismic event. The joke is clever because, technically, the house is close to the moon, just not close enough for the moon to have any effect on the pool.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The tsunami coming out of the pool is a pun on the phrase "to rise out of the sea." The man in the backyard is surprised, because he thought they were too close to the moon, which is why he told the woman not to buy the house. However, the real reason the tsunami came out of the pool is because they are too close to the moon, which is causing the tides to be higher than normal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a tsunami coming out of a pool is impossible, and the only way it could happen is if the moon's gravity was pulling the water towards it. However, the man's comment implies that he blame the woman for buying a house too close to the moon, when in reality, it is not her fault.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur. The man says that the house is too close to the moon, which has nothing to do with the tsunami coming out of the pool. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the man says "too close to the moon," but he means "too close to the sea," which is where tsunamis usually come from.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
