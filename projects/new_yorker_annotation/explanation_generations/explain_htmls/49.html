In this situation, however, the kitchen is actually dangerous, with traps and spikes everywhere: someone could literally die if they tried to use it. The contrast between the typical meaning of the phrase and the situation at hand is what makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the potential renters/buyers of the house knew that the kitchen would be full of traps, but decided to purchase/rent it anyway because they liked the kitchen so much. This is a play on the phrase "a deal to die for."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the kitchen is so dangerous that it could literally kill you. This is obviously not what most people are looking for in a kitchen. The listing for the property probably just said something like "nice kitchen" or "spacious kitchen," but the joke is that it's actually a kitchen to die for because it's so dangerous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the kitchen is so dangerous that it could literally kill you. The joke is also amusing because it is a play on words: "a kitchen to die for" is a proverbially good thing (something you would want in your house), but in this case, it is quite literal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who is looking at the listing for the apartment did not expect the kitchen to be literally lethal, with a number of traps that could easily kill a person. The contrast between the expectation of a normal kitchen and the reality of a dangerous one is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a dark play on words. A "kitchen to die for" is usually a euphemism meaning a very nice kitchen, but in this context, it's literally true: if you step wrong, you will die. This demonstrates the dangers of not reading a listing carefully before agreeing to live in a new place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, when realtors are trying to sell a home, they often use euphemisms to make the property sound more appealing than it is. In this case, the kitchen is actually a death trap, and so the realtor's statement is tragically accurate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while in most cases, a "kitchen to die for" would simply be an idiom meaning a very luxurious or high-end kitchen, in this case, it's quite literal: the kitchen has been set up in a way that it could very easily kill someone. The listing did warn them, but they weren't expecting the traps to actually be literal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a "kitchen to die for" is usually a idiom meaning a kitchen that is very luxurious or desirable. In this case, the kitchen is "to die for" in a more literal sense, since there are traps set up that would kill anyone who came in. This is a play on words since the traps are usually associated with dieting (i.e. "I'm on a diet, I can't have that cake, it's a trap!")</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "a kitchen to die for." In this context, the word "die" is used both literally (as in, if you step on a trap, you will die) and figuratively (as in, the kitchen is so great, you would be willing to die for it).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who is speaking is making a pun on the phrase "a kitchen to die for." A kitchen to die for usually means a kitchen that is so beautiful and perfect that you would die to have it. However, in this case, the kitchen is actually deadly, with all of the traps. So, the person who is speaking is saying that the listing for the apartment was accurate, in that it did warn them that the kitchen was dangerous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the traps are so dangerous that they could kill the people in the kitchen, but the person who listed the property for sale (or rent) used the idiom "to die for" to describe how amazing the kitchen is. This is a play on words, as the idiom is usually used to describe how desirable something is, but in this case, the thing that is "to die for" is literally deadly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of a kitchen being a place where people usually prepare food and eat, it is strange and dangerous to have traps everywhere. The fact that the traps are present makes it clear that the person who set them up wanted to kill whoever came in, which is a far cry from the usual functions of a kitchen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in real estate listings, "kitchen to die for" is often used as a selling point for a home, because people spend a lot of time in their kitchens. However, in this case, the kitchen is so dangerous that it's literally a death trap. The contrast between the two meanings of "kitchen to die for" is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "kitchen to die for" is usually used to describe an kitchen that is so beautiful and luxurious that you would be willing to die to have it. In this case, the "kitchen to die for" is literal: if you step into this kitchen, you will die because of the traps.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="48.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="50.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
