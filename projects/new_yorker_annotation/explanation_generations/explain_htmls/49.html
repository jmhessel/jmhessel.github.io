The joke implies that the man has a drinking problem, and is willing to search through a sandbox (a place associated with childhood innocence) to find his alcohol.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the sandbox is looking for his Scotch (whisky) but can't find it. The joke is that Mrs. Freeley (a homophone of "freely") has hidden the whisky somewhere on the property, and the man is looking for it in the sandbox. This is a clever way to hide alcohol from adults, as they would typically not think to look in a sandbox for their drinks.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="48.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="50.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
