It just smells the other car on you.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the play on words with the phrase "smells the other car on you." In this context, the word "smells" can be read as a homonym for "has sex with." Thus, the joke is implying that the car is going to have sex with the couple.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The salesman is trying to calm the potential customers by saying that the car just smells the other car that they were previously test driving; however, the way he phrases it makes it sound like the car is smelling them. This is confusing and amusing because it's not clear if the car is smelling the other car or the people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "smells the other car on you" is a pun on the actual phrase "smells the other car's scent on you." In other words, the car is able to smell the other car's scent on the couple, which is strange because cars don't have noses.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat-car is a ridiculous and impractical design, but the salesman is trying to downplay its weirdness by acting like it's not a big deal. The joke works because it's a play on the fact that in the car-selling business, salespeople often try to distract potential customers from a car's flaws by talking about something else.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is trying to assure the couple that the car doesn't actually have teeth, it just smells the other car because it's a new car. However, the fact that the car has teeth is indicative of the fact that it's a modified car, which would be a turn-off for most people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the car is acting like a dog, smelling the other car on the man and woman. The joke is poking fun at the fact that new cars often have a strong smell, like that of chemicals, which can be off-putting to some people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "the other car" could mean a different car from the one the person is looking at, or it could mean a car that is the opposite sex from the one the person is looking at. In this case, the salesman is telling the potential buyer that the car doesn't like the smell of other cars, meaning it's likely to be a male car. The joke is clever because it's a double meaning that is also a pun on the phrase "the other car."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The term "cars that smell other cars" is a joke in itself, but the salesman's explanation that the car is just smelling the other car on the couple adds an extra layer of absurdity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The car salesman is trying to assure the man and woman that the car is not dangerous, even though it looks like a monster, by saying that it's just smelling the other car on them. However, the word "smelling" can also be a euphemism for "checking someone out", which would make the car's behavior seem threatening instead of just curious.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The salesman is trying to reassure the couple that the car is just smelling them, but the way he phrases it makes it sound like the car is going to eat them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The husband is trying to reassure his wife that the car is not actually dangerous, despite its appearances. He says that the car is just smelling the other car on them, meaning that it's harmless. However, the word "smelling" can also be a euphemism for "attacking," which is what the cat-car is actually doing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The couple is looking at a car that has cat parts on it, and the salesman tells them to relax because the car just smells the other car on them. The play on words is that the car doesn't just smell the other car, it literally has parts of the other car (i.e., a cat) on it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man and woman are presumably worried/scared about riding in a car that is a living creature, and the salesman is assuring them that the car is just smelling the other car on them, as if that is a normal thing. The contrast between the normal behavior of a car (smelling other cars) and the abnormal behavior of a car (being a living creature) is what makes this joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The couple is looking at a car that has been modified to have cat parts, and the salesman says that it is just smelling the other car on them. The word "smelling" can mean to detect, as in the sense of smell, or to be suspicious of, as in to smell something fishy. In this case, the salesman is saying that the car is just being suspicious of the other car because it can smell it on them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the car is behaving like a predatory animal, smelling the other car on the man and woman, and the salesman is trying to downplay the situation and make it seem normal.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="109.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="111.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
