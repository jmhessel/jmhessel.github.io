This is strange because the man is just sitting in a bathtub, not doing anything that would indicate that he is possessed. The woman's question implies that she think the man is in danger and needs to be exorcised, when in reality, he is just taking a bath.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is asking about their plumber in a very serious tone, and the man is making a joke about how the plumber might need to do an exorcism because of the way the woman is looking at him. This is funny because it's a play on the fact that people often feel uncomfortable when they see someone's feet, which are considered to be dirty and gross.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is surprised to see a man in a bathtub, and her first thought is to wonder if their plumber also does exorcisms. This is absurd because exorcisms are usually performed on people who are possessed by demons, and the woman does not think that the man in the bathtub is possessed by a demon.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="219.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="221.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
