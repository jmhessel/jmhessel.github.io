In this context, "choosing your own lobster" would mean to be able to pick the lobster you wanted from a tank, as one might do at a seafood restaurant. However, the man in the courtroom is wearing a snorkeling mask, which makes it appear as though he has been in the tank with the lobsters, and has been caught and brought to court.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is being charged with a crime, but he is trying to defend himself by saying that he followed the instructions on the menu. In this case, the menu said to "choose your own lobster", and so the man chose his own lobster. The fact that the menu said to choose your own lobster does not mean that it is legal to do so, and so the man's argument is not valid.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lobster is in the wrong place. It's usually served in a restaurant, but here it's being held in a courtroom. The joke is also funny because the lobster is a seafood item, and it's not usually considered a criminal. The man is also dressed for swimming, which is another clue that he's out of place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the defendant is in court for stealing a lobster from a restaurant, and he's trying to defend himself by saying that he chose his lobster from the menu. However, the fact that he's in a courtroom implies that he didn't pay for the lobster, which is why he's on trial. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the defendant chose his own lobster, but he didn't pay for it, so technically, he chose to steal it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's attire is out of place in the courtroom. He is dressed for snorkeling, which is usually done in a beach or pool setting, but not in a courtroom. The fact that he was probably arrested for snorkeling in a place where he wasn't supposed to be highlights the absurdity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is on trial for stealing a lobster from a seafood restaurant, and he is trying to defend himself by saying that he was only following the instructions on the menu. However, the judge is not convinced, and the joke is funny because it points out the absurdity of the man's defense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is in a courtroom and is clearly not supposed to be there. He is dressed for swimming, which indicates that he was probably at the beach before he ended up in court. The joke is clever because the man could have chosen any lobster from the menu, but he chose the one that got him into trouble.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is in court for a crime, but it seems like he thought he was going to be choosing a lobster from a menu. The fact that he's dressed for swimming also makes it seem like he came straight from the beach. The joke is clever because it plays on the fact that "chose your own lobster" could mean either choosing a lobster to eat or choosing a lobster to be your pet.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because although the man is in court, he is still wearing his swimming clothes. He is probably there because he was caught stealing a lobster from a restaurant, and he is using the defense that he was only following the restaurant's menu, which said that he could choose his own lobster.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is dressed for swimming is in court because he chose his own lobster from a restaurant's menu. The joke is funny because it is a play on words: the man "chose" his own lobster, meaning he selected it from the menu, but the word "chose" can also mean "stole". So, the man is saying that he did not intend to steal the lobster, he just wanted to choose his own lobster from the menu.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man being held before the judge is wearing a wet suit and fins, as if he had just come from snorkeling. The joke implies that he had been caught stealing lobsters from a seafood restaurant, and thought that he would be able to choose his own lobster as part of the theft. The lobster joke is a play on the common phrase "choose your own ____," which is often used to mean that there are many options to choose from.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the courtroom is wearing a scuba set and swimming gear, which is unusual. He is being charged with a crime, but it's not clear what that crime is. The joke is that he's being charged with the crime of choosing his own lobster from a menu, which is a silly thing to be charged with.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in trial appears to be trying to use the fact that he was given a choice of lobster as his defense. The court room is not the place to be discussing what was eaten for dinner, and so his defense is out of place and unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lobster is in the courtroom as a defendant, and he is being accused of choosing his own lobster. The joke is a play on words, as the accused is a lobster, and he is also accused of choosing his own seafood. The Lobster is clearly not happy with the situation he's in, and the joke implies that he would rather be swimming and eating seafood than be in court.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the courtroom is wearing a snorkel, and the judge asks him why he is there. The man responds with a clever play on words, saying that he was just following the menu's instructions to "choose your own lobster." The joke is clever because it is a great example of word play.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
