The joke is playing off the idea that dinosaurs are extinct, and so it's absurd to think that a caveman would be encountering one.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the irony of the situation: the man is being bitten by a dinosaur, which is usually considered a dangerous and scary creature, but he is being praised for the dinosaur's "unconditional love." This is a play on the fact that many people believe that dogs have "unconditional love" for their owners, even though dogs have been known to bite people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the cave is in a very strange and dangerous situation: he's being bitten by a dinosaur, which shouldn't be possible given that they're from different time periods. The woman's comment, that dinosaurs are known for their unconditional love, is meant to be sarcastic, implying that the man should have known better than to get too close to the dinosaur in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's comment suggests that he is familiar with dinosaurs and their habits, despite the fact that dinosaurs went extinct millions of years before humans existed. The man's comment also suggests that he views the dinosaur as a pet, despite the fact that it is clear the dinosaur is feral and attacking him. The absurdity of the situation is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dinosaur is biting the man's leg and the man is calmly talking to the other cavepeople as if this is a perfectly normal thing. The joke is poking fun at the idea that dinosaurs are often thought of as ferocious and dangerous animals, when in reality they may have just been misunderstood. The man's comment about the dinosaur's "unconditional love" is sarcastic, implying that the dinosaur is anything but loving.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's leg is being bitten by a dinosaur, and yet he still tries to downplay the situation by saying that dinosaurs are known for their unconditional love. The joke is absurd because dinosaurs were not around during caveman times, so the man must be referring to something else.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "unconditional" can mean two different things: without conditions, or absolute. In this case, the caveperson is saying that the dinosaurs love for him is without conditions, meaning that the dinosaur will continue to bite his leg even if he stops doing what he is doing. However, the other interpretation, that the love is absolute, is also true: the dinosaur will continue to bite his leg even if the caveman wants it to stop, making the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the cave is being bitten by a dinosaur, which is impossible because dinosaurs went extinct millions of years before humans existed. The dinosaur is biting the man's leg, which is a sign of affection in many animals, particularly dogs. The joke suggests that the man sees the dinosaur's actions as sweet, despite the fact that it is a very dangerous situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "unconditional love": in a normal scenario, unconditional love would refer to the love between a parent and child, or a romantic partner, that is not based on any conditions. However, in this context, the man's love for the dinosaur is conditional on the dinosaur not biting his leg.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common saying "dogs are known for their unconditional love." In this case, the speaker is referring to the dinosaur, which is biting the man's leg, as an example of an unconditionally loving animal. This is ironic because the man is in pain and clearly does not want to be bitten by the dinosaur.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the comment made by one of the cavepeople is unexpected. It's strange that the caveperson would make a joke in this situation, and even stranger that the joke would be about the reptile's love being unconditional. The fact that the caveperson is making light of a dangerous situation suggests that this is a common occurrence and they are used to it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is mixing two disparate things that don't usually go together: dinosaurs and love. The speaker is pretending that the fact that the dinosaur is biting the man's leg is a sign of affection, rather than aggression. This is humorous because it is a non-sequitur.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the popular saying "dogs are known for their unconditional love." In this case, the caveperson is being attacked by a reptile, which is the opposite of love. The joke is clever because it takes the saying and flips it to create a humorous contrasting image.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it puns on the phrase "unconditional love". The speaker is saying that the reason the dinosaur is biting the man's leg is because they love each other so much, despite the fact that they are from different time periods. The joke is also funny because it's a non-sequitur: the man being bitten by the dinosaur has nothing to do with the conversation the cave-people were having before he was introduced.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words; the phrase "unconditional love" is typically used to describe the love between a parent and child, or a husband and wife. In this case, the phrase is used to describe the love between the caveman and the reptile, which is clearly not the same kind of love. This joke pokes fun at the way people use the phrase "unconditional love" without really understanding what it means.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="219.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="221.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
