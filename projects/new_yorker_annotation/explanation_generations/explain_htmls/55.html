It's not as if the fish can understand or judge him, so the fish should be the least of his concerns. The joke is funny because it's a non-issue that he's fixating on.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is saying that he is not comfortable discussing his personal life in front of his fish, implying that the fish is sensitive to topics like that or is a member of his family who he doesn't want to embarrassing himself in front of. The joke is clever because normally, people would say they aren't comfortable discussing something in front of their "parents/children" etc, but the man says "fish", implying that the animal is just as important to him as any other family member.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "I'm not comfortable discussing that" is often used when someone doesn't want to talk about a sensitive topic in front of others. In this case, the patient doesn't want to discuss his sensitive topic in front of the therapist's fish, which is an animal. The joke is clever because it's a double-meaning: the phrase "in front of my fish" can mean either that the fish is present in the room or that the fish is a object of ridicule.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the fish is the only one in the room who is not a sentient being, and thus, cannot understand or participate in the therapy session. The man is saying that he doesn't want to discuss his feelings in front of the fish because it would be pointless, which is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's absurd that the man would be worried about discussing something personal in front of his fish. His fish is unlikely to judge him, and even if it did, it's not like the fish could tell anyone. The man's insecurity is humorous because it's irrational.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In this context, "fish" is both a type of pet and a term used to describe a person who is bad at keeping secrets (i.e. "he's a real bigmouth, he'll tell anyone our secrets"). So, the man on the couch is saying that he doesn't want to discuss his secrets in front of the therapist's pet fish, because the fish will tell everyone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The patient is not comfortable discussing his problem in front of other people, but the other people in the room are animals, not humans. So, technically, the patient is not comfortable discussing his problem in front of other people, but rather in front of other fish.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "I'm not comfortable discussing that in front of my therapist." In this case, the man is saying he doesn't want to discuss his personal matters with his fish, which is absurd. The joke is also absurd because, in general, animals are not known for being good listeners or for giving sage advice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the therapy couch is saying he doesn't want to discuss his problem in front of the therapist's fish, as if the fish is a fellow patient who is also in therapy. The joke is funny because it's unexpected and paints a surreal picture of what therapy might be like if animals were also able to receive and benefit from it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the patient is a fish, and so the psychiatrist is effectively saying that he's not comfortable discussing the patient's problems in front of the other patients in the room. The joke is a play on the fact that patients in therapy often feel like they are being judged by the other patients in the room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the use of the word "fish" as a pejorative term for someone who is considered stupid or gullible. The implication is that the patient is saying that they don't want to talk about their problems in front of the other animals in the room because they think the animals will judge them or not understand.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The animal on the psychiatrist's couch is not a human, but a fish. The patient is not comfortable discussing certain topics in front of other people, but in this case, the psychiatrist is the only other person in the room, and the patient is not comfortable discussing certain topics in front of the fish.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while people might have feelings of reluctance to discuss certain topics in front of strangers (e.g. in a therapy setting), it would be absurd to have the same feelings of reluctance in front of a pet. The joke is a play on the fact that, even though animals on therapy couches are absurd, the man still has the same reservations about discussing personal matters in front of them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "I'm not comfortable discussing that in front of my therapist". In this case, the person being asked to discuss something is not comfortable discussing it in front of their fish, which is absurd because fish are animals that can't understand human language. The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that people often feel uncomfortable discussing personal matters in front of their therapist, as if the therapist is going to judge them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it puts the psychiatrist in the position of the animal, who is usually the patient of the psychiatrist. In this case, the psychiatrist is the one who is uncomfortable discussing something in front of someone else, and so he is asking for privacy. The joke is clever because it inverts the power dynamic between psychiatrist and patient, and also because it's a play on the phrase "I'm not comfortable discussing that in front of my children."</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="54.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="56.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
