However, the huge wave is a symbol of the current political climate in the US, which is very anti-immigrant. The joke is clever because it uses two different meanings of the word "miss" --- the wave will literally miss the boat, but it's also a pun on the fact that immigrants will be "missed" or not allowed into the country.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The people in the boat are worried about the giant wave that is about to crush them, but the person making the joke is referring to the other meaning of "polls": an opinion poll, which could be used to predict whether or not the wave will actually hit the boat. In other words, the person making the joke is telling the others not to worry about the wave, because it won't actually hit them according to the polls.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people in the boat are worried about the gigantic face, which is a metaphor for the Statue of Liberty, crashing down on them. However, the person telling the joke says that they don't need to worry because the polls show that it will miss them. This is a play on the fact that, in US elections, people often vote based on which candidate they think will win, rather than who they actually want to win. In this case, the person is saying that they don't need to worry because the polls show that the Statue of Liberty will miss them, even though it's a giant face and they're in a small boat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the wave has a scary face, the people in the boat are not worried because they trust the polls. The polls, presumably, show that the wave will not hit their boat. However, the fact that the wave has a face implies that it is sentient and trying to scare the people in the boat, which goes against the assumption that the wave is not malicious.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "the sky is falling." In this case, instead of the sky, it's a wave, and instead of falling, it's coming towards them. The speaker is calm because they have seen the polls, which presumably show that the wave will not, in fact, hit their boat. This is a humorous take on the often-anxious attitude people have towards waves, which are usually harmless.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people in the boat are rowing away from a giant wave, which is usually depicted as a natural disaster. However, in this case, the joke is that the people are rowing away from a political disaster, i.e., the Trump administration. The fact that the Statue of Liberty is in the background also adds to the joke, because it's a symbol of freedom and hope for immigrants, which is the opposite of what the Trump administration stands for.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people in the boat are worried about the giant face on the wave, which seems to be headed towards them. However, the person who made the joke is confident that they will be safe, because "the polls" (i.e., public opinion) show that the wave will not hit them. This is a play on the fact that polls are often used to predict the outcome of events, such as elections.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people in the boat are worried about the huge wave that has a face on it, seemingly coming to crash down on them. The person making the joke reassures them that they will be okay by saying that the polls show that the wave will miss them. This is a play on words because the word "polls" can refer to surveys conducted to predict the outcome of events (in this case, the wave missing the boat) or the raised portion of a boat that people stand on (i.e., the people in the boat will be safe because they are on the raised portion of the boat).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The people in the boat are worried about the large wave that is looming over them, but the speaker says not to worry because the "polls" show that it will miss them. In this context, "polls" refers to public opinion polls, which are often used to predict the outcome of elections. However, the word "polls" can also refer to the word "poles," as in the poles that a boat uses for navigation. Thus, the joke is saying that even though the large wave is coming towards them, they will be safe because the boat will be able to navigate around it using the poles.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the boat is trying to reassure the other people that they will avoid the giant wave, despite the fact that it is clearly headed towards them. He does this by referencing the polls, which are often used to predict the outcomes of elections. In this case, the polls are wrong, and the wave will indeed hit the boat, but the man is using them as a way to try to calm everyone down.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it references the fact that, in the United States, there is often a lot of talk about the dangers of immigrants coming across the border from Mexico by boat. In this case, the people in the boat are not worried about the wave, which could be interpreted as a metaphor for an immigrant, because the polls show that it will miss them. This is a play on the fact that, often, people who are against immigrants will say that they are coming to the country "illegally," as if they are criminals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The 'polls' being referenced are not used to predict the weather, but rather public opinion polls. In this case, the speaker is saying that, even though it looks like the huge wave will hit them, the polls (i.e., public opinion) show that they will miss it, meaning they will be safe. This is a reassuring message to the others in the boat who look worried.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "polls" the person is referring to are not opinion polls, but rather the waves that the rowboat is sitting in. The person is saying that, based on the waves (the polls), they don't think the big wave will hit them. However, the wave is actually a gigantic face, which changes the meaning of the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people in the boat are being chased by a giant wave, which is a metaphor for the incoming "blue wave" of democratic voters in the 2018 midterm elections. The joke is that the people in the boat are confident that the wave will miss them, even though it's clearly heading right for them, because of the polls. The pollsters could be wrong, but the people in the boat are trusting them anyway.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is worried about the huge wave with a scary face, which is coming towards them, but they are reassured by the fact that the Statue of Liberty is in the background. The Statue of Liberty is a symbol of freedom and democracy, and the fact that it is in the background of the scene reassures the speaker that they will be safe from the wave.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="54.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="56.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
