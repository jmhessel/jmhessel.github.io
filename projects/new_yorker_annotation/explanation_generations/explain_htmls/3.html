The gingerbread man is a "confection" --- meaning a sweet food --- and the doctors are saying that the gingerbread man has "spread" meaning that the icing or decoration on him has become too wide.

The gingerbread man is sick, and the doctor is saying that the sickness has "spread" --- but in this case, the "sickness" is the gingerbread man's actual physical body, which is made of gingerbread, and has thus "spread" or expanded.
