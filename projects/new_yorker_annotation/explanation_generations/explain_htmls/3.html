The boss is asking the man why he thinks he was chosen for the job, and the man responds with a joke that implies that the boss chose him out of convenience because he was the "first choice." The joke is clever because it is true in a literal sense: the man was the first choice for the job, but the boss didn't choose him because he was the best candidate, but because he was the first one available.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The original question was "Why are there so many chairs in front of me?" which the man answers with a joke. The joke implies that the person asking the question was not the first person chosen for the job, and the chairs in front of him represent the people who were chosen before him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in the back of the room is likely feeling self-conscious about being the last one seated. The boss's joke implies that the person is not their first choice for the job, which is a common insecurity for people in the workforce. However, the fact that there are too many chairs in the room suggests that the person is not the only one feeling self-conscious, as there are likely other candidates who were also not the first choice and are also seated in the back of the room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The boss is asking the man why he thinks he was chosen for the job, and the man responds with a joke about how he could have been anyone's first choice. The joke is clever because it is true: the man could have been anyone's first choice, but he wasn't.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man being interviewed for the job is sitting in a line of chairs, implying that he is not the first choice for the job, but the interviewer still wants to talk to him. The joke is a play on words, because the man in the line of chairs is literally not the first choice, but the interviewer is also choice for the job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The boss is asking the man why he thinks he was chosen for the job, and the man responds with a joke that he was not the first choice. The word "choice" can mean both "the act of choosing" and "a selection of things from which to choose," so the man is technically correct: he was not the first person chosen for the job, there were other people who were chosen before him, but he was ultimately the best "choice" (or selection) for the job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because there are too many chairs in the office, which implies that the person who is seated in the back is not the first choice for the job. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words: "choice" can mean both "the act of choosing" and "a good or bad option." In this case, the person in the back is not the best "choice" for the job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of thedouble meaning of the word "choice": in a normal scenario, the man would be the CEO's first choice, but in this context, the man is sitting at the back of a line of chairs, suggesting that he was not the first choice. This is a clever way to suggest that the man is not the best CEO because he was not the first choice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the queue (line) is asking the man in the office why he wasn't chosen for the job, but the fact that there are so many chairs between them implies that the man was in fact the last choice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because there are too many chairs in the room, implying that the person who was just hired was not the first choice for the job. The employer may have interviewed several people and had to settle for the person who is currently seated, hence the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. On the one hand, the man behind the desk is asking the man in the foreground what makes him think he wasn't the first choice for the position he was given. However, the fact that there is a line of chairs behind the man in the foreground implies that he is, in fact, the first choice--he's just not the first person they interviewed. So, the man behind the desk is really asking what makes him think he wasn't the first person they talked to, not the first person they hired.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man behind the desk is asking the man in the queue (line) why he thinks he was not their first choice. This could mean that the man was not the first person they interviewed for the job, or, more likely, that he was not their first choice for the job. The joke is clever because it can be interpreted in two ways.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the foreground is sitting at the back of a row of chairs, implying that he was not the first person chosen for the job. This is a play on words because the "first choice" could mean either the first person chosen for the job or the first person chosen to interview for the job. In either case, the man in the foreground is not the first choice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the foreground is sitting in a line of chairs, as if he is waiting to be interviewed for a job. However, the man behind the desk is not the interviewer, he is the interviewee. The joke is that the man in the foreground is not the first choice for the job, and has mistakenly sat in the wrong line.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is asking why the other man thought he was not their first choice. The joke is that the man is sitting in the back of a line of chairs, which suggests that he was not the first choice.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="2.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="4.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
