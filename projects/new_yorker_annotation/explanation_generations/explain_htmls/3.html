In this case, the person sees the sheep that is going to be a problem, but the problem is that the sheep is too large.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. When a group of sheep are together, they are called a flock. The word "flock" can also be used as a verb, meaning to come together in a group. Thus, the joke is suggesting that one of the sheep is going to "flock" or come together with the others in a group, and be a problem for the sheepdogs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is playing with the concept of "herding sheep." In this case, the "problematic" sheep is the one who is not following the pack, and is instead standing out, or facing the opposite direction. The joke implies that this "problematic" sheep is going to be more trouble for the sheep dogs to deal with than the other sheep.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because sheep are often thought of as being docile and easy to manage. However, the fact that the sheepdog is twice the size of the sheep implies that the sheepdog is worried that one of the sheep might be a problem. In other words, the joke is playing on the stereotypes of both sheep and sheepdogs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it points out the ridiculousness of the situation: the dogs are so big that they can easily control the sheep, and yet they are worried about which one of the sheep is going to be a problem. This is silly because the sheep are not a threat to the dogs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it outlines thedogs' conversation in which they are discussing which sheep is going to be the "black sheep" of the bunch. The term "black sheep" is used to describe someone who is different from the rest of the group, and is often seen as a negative thing. However, in this case, the black sheep is just a regular sheep who happens to be different in color from the rest of the flock.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dogs are talking about the sheep as if they are criminals or bad people. The dogs are saying that they see one sheep in particular who is going to be a problem, which is ironic because sheep are known for being gentle and docile animals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "problem" can be read as both a noun and a verb. In this context, the word "problem" is being used as a noun, referring to the one sheep who is going to be a problem. However, the word can also be read as a verb, in which case it would refer to the act of the sheep becoming a problem. This double meaning is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Problem" can mean two things: first, it can be a noun meaning a difficulty that needs to be overcome; second, it can be a verb meaning to cause trouble. In this case, the sheepdog is saying that he sees the one sheep who is going to cause trouble.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, despite the fact that the sheep dogs are significantly larger than the sheep, they are still worried about one of the sheep getting out of line. This is silly because, if any sheep were to get out of line, the dogs could easily stop it with their size advantage.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it suggests that one of the sheep is going to be a problem for the dogs in the future. This is silly because sheep are not known for being particularly troublesome animals, and so it would be very strange if one of them were to be a problem for the sheep dogs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dogs are talking about herding the sheep, and one of them says that he thinks he sees the one who's going to be a problem. The fact that the dogs are so much bigger than the sheep implies that herding them should be easy, but the dog's comment suggests that even herding sheep is not without its challenges.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The sheepdog is saying that he sees the one sheep who is going to be a problem. But, the word "problem" can also mean a mathematics problem. So, the sheepdog is saying that he sees the one sheep who is going to be a math problem. This is a clever play on words that takes advantage of the fact that "problem" can have multiple meanings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because sheep are usually considered to be docile animals, and so it's unexpected to see a sheep dog that is twice the size of the sheep it's supposed to be guarding. The joke is also clever because the sheep dog is literally "seeing" the one sheep who is going to be a "problem."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The person who is speaking is looking at the sheep and trying to figure out which one is going to give them trouble. But because the sheep are so much smaller than the sheep dogs, it's actually the sheep dogs who are going to be the problem.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
