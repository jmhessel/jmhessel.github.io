In the game show, contestants are given the choice between two different doors, one of which has a prize behind it while the other has a gag prize. The man spraying off the toaster is the equivalent of a contestant who has chosen the door with the gag prize behind it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is hosing down the toaster is clearly doing something wrong. He is probably regretting his decision to hose down the toaster, and wishes he had chosen door number 2 instead (a reference to the game show Let's Make a Deal, where contestants can choose to keep their current prize or trade it for a mystery prize behind one of three doors).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is doing something that is usually done indoors (washing a toaster), but he is doing it outdoors. The neighbor watching him implies that he is doing something strange or unusual. The man says he should have chosen door number 2, meaning he should have chosen to do something else instead of washing the toaster, but the phrase also sounds like he is saying he should have chosen to do it indoors instead of outdoors.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is clearly referencing the game show "Let's Make a Deal," in which contestants choose one of three doors, behind one of which is a grand prize. In this case, the man chose door number 1, which was a toaster, and not the grand prize.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is doing something that is usually done indoors (washing a toaster) in an outdoor setting (in the front yard with a hose). The joke suggests that the man regrets his decision to wash the toaster outside, and that he would have been better off if he had chosen "door number 2" (i.e., if he had chosen to do something else).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the "should have" phrase. In the game show "Let's Make a Deal", there is always a choice between three doors, one of which has a valuable prize behind it. The contestant usually chooses Door #1, but sometimes, they are advised to choose Door #2 instead, which usually has an inferior prize. In this case, the man chose to wash his toaster outside, but he wishes he had chosen the door that led to the car wash instead, because car washes are much better equipped to wash things like a toaster.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the game show "Let's Make a Deal." In the game show, there are three doors: behind one door is a prize, behind the other doors are GOB Bluth from "Arrested Development" (a character known for being slimy and despised). The joke is that, if the man had chosen door number 2, he would have gotten Bluth, but instead, he got stuck with the toaster. The joke is funnier if the reader is familiar with "Let's Make a Deal" and GOB Bluth.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the famous line from the game show "Let's Make a Deal." In that show, contestants are faced with the choice of several doors, one of which leads to a grand prize. The man in this scene was faced with the choice of hosing down the toaster or not, and he chose door number 2, which turned out to be the wrong choice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is spraying off a toaster, which is an unusual thing to do. The joke is a play on the phrase "I should have chosen door number 2," which is often said when someone chooses the wrong option. In this case, the man hosing off the toaster chose the wrong door, which is door number 2.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is washing the toaster in a way that is usually reserved for cars (with a hose and all), and he's making a joke about how he should have chosen the other door, meaning he should have chosen a different method of cleaning the toaster.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to the game show "Let's Make a Deal," in which contestants choose one of three doors, one of which contains a prize. The prize is usually something silly or undesirable, which is what the man in the joke is left with after hosing off his toaster.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is doing something bizarre (washing a toaster outside) and the neighbor is reacting as if this is a normal thing to do. The man then says that he should have chosen door number 2, implying that he made a mistake in choosing to wash the toaster outside.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the game show "Let's Make a Deal," in which a contestant is given the choice of several prizes behind different doors, one of which is usually a "booby prize." In this case, the man watering the toaster is the contestant, and he chose the door with the toaster behind it, which is the booby prize.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is washing a toaster, which is a common kitchen appliance, but the way he is doing it (with a hose outside) more closely resembles the process of car-washing. The man's neighbor may have assumed he was washing his car, which is why he looks so surprised. The joke is a clever way of pointing out the absurdity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is clearly not winning the "toaster wars." He's trying to clean his toaster in an unconventional way, and he's not having much success. His neighbor's judgmental gaze implies that he's not the only one who thinks this is a strange way to clean a toaster. The joke is a play on the famous "should have chosen door number 2" line from the game show, "Let's Make a Deal." On that show, contestants are given the choice of several different doors, one of which contains a prize. The joke is that the man should have chosen the car wash (door number 2), which is a much more effective way to clean a toaster.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
