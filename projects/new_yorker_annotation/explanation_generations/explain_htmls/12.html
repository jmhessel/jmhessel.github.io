I'm in the middle of a sting operation.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's face on the beehive is unexpected and gives the beehive a humanlike quality. The joke is also funny because of the double meaning of "sting operation": the man could either be referring to a police sting operation or the fact that he is being stung by bees.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the beehive is literally in the middle of a bee sting operation, but he's also asking the woman not to give away his hidden location because he's in the middle of a covert police operation. The double meaning is humorous because it's unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the beehive is literally in the middle of a "sting" operation, as he's being stung by bees. However, he's also undercover, in the middle of a secret mission or investigation. So, the joke is that he's telling the woman not to "blow his cover" or give away his secret identity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man's face in the beehive is literally in the middle of a "sting" operation, as in he's undercover, but he's also about to get stung by a bee.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's face coming out of the beehive implies that he is a bee, and thus, undercover. The fact that he is asking the woman not to "blow his cover" adds to the humor because it's a double-meaning: if she blows his cover, she will expose his true identity as a bee, but she will also literal blow him away with air.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the beehive is pretending to be a bee, and he's telling the woman not to reveal his true identity. The word "sting" can mean both the act of being stung by a bee, and a covert operation by law enforcement.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's face in the beehive is a reference to the fact that bees live in hives. The man is saying that he's in the middle of a "sting operation," which is a type of investigation where law enforcement officers pose as criminals in order to catch them in the act. The joke is also a play on words, because when a bee "stings" someone, it's injecting them with a venom that can be painful.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's face coming out of the beehive makes it look like he is the queen bee. However, he is actually a police officer who is undercover in a sting operation. The woman is telling him not to blow his cover, or else the operation will be jeopardized.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the beehive is hiding, but he's also in a beehive, which is where bees live. So he's both hiding and in plain sight. Furthermore, he's in the middle of a "sting" operation, which is another word for an undercover operation. The joke is clever because it ties together several different meanings of the word "sting."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's face in the beehive is a reference to the fact that bees are often used in sting operations by law enforcement. The joke is also funny because it's impossible for a man to actually fit inside a small beehive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's face on the beehive is not what one would expect to see. The joke is even funnier because the man asks the woman not to blow his cover, implying that he is undercover, and that the beehive is part of his disguise.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's face coming out of the beehive suggests that he is, in fact, a bee. The joke is a play on words because "sting operation" has a double meaning: it can refer to a covert mission conducted by law enforcement to catch criminals, but it can also refer to the act of a bee using its stinger. Therefore, the man's earnest request not to "blow his cover" is humorous because it's a bee asking a human not to reveal that he is, in fact, a bee.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's head is so big that it doesn't fit in the beehive, but he's trying to pretend that it does. He's doing this because he's undercover, and if he were to reveal himself, it would ruin the operation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "blow my cover" and the fact that bees make honey. The man's head in the beehive is literally in the middle of a "sting operation" to make honey. The woman is staring at him because she's surprised to see a man's head in a beehive, not realizing that he's there on purpose.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's face on the beehive is unexpected and out of place. His request not to blow his cover implies that he is undercover, perhaps as a bee, and is in the middle of a sting operation. The joke plays on the fact that the man's cover is so outlandish that it is easily blown.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="11.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="13.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
