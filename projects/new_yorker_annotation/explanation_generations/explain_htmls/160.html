The joke also implies that his job is so boring that even being executed would be a more interesting way to spend his time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is so bored with his office job that he's willing to be executed in the electric chair just to get out of it. The fact that he's more concerned with his lunch plans than his impending death is both darkly humorous and a comment on how boring office work can be.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is hooked into an electric chair, which might be used to execute him at noon (12:00pm), but he's telling whomever he's talking to on the phone to cancel his 12:01pm appointment. The fact that he's so calm about his impending execution adds to the humor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is so calm about being in an electric chair that he's still able to attend to his work obligations. He's even bored, which is why he's reading a document. The joke of someone being so calm in such a high-stakes situation is what makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, although the man is in a potentially dangerous situation, he's still just going about his business, answering the phone and reading some documents. The fact that he's so nonchalant about being in an electric chair helps to highlight the mundane nature of his work day.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is so bored with his work that he's willing to be executed just to get out of it. The fact that he's casual about it ("Cancel my twelve-oh-one") makes it even funnier because it's such a nonchalant way to respond to such a serious situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person is sitting in an electric chair about to be executed, but he's still conducting business as usual. He's telling his assistant to cancel a meeting he has at noon, as if he's in a completely normal situation. The humor comes from the incongruity of being in an electric chair and still conducting business as if nothing is wrong.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's response to the person on the other end of the phone implies that he has been in the electric chair so often that it's become a nuisance, and he's just trying to get out of his appointments. This is absurd because, while people might be executed in an electric chair, it's not something that happens on a regular basis.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is so bored with his work that he's apparently about to be executed in an electric chair, and he's more concerned with cancelling his lunch plans than with the fact that he's about to die.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the common office situation in which someone's day is so uneventful and boring that they feel the need to cancel their lunch plans. In this case, the man is so bored that he's about to be executed in an electric chair, and he's still more concerned with his lunch plans than his impending death.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is so bored with his life that even the prospect of being executed in an electric chair doesn't phase him. He's so blas√© that he's even willing to cancel a lunch plans, which suggests that he has no intention of fighting his impending execution.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is scheduling an execution, but his bored voice implies that executions are a regular occurrence for him, so much so that he needs to schedule them around his lunch break. The fact that he's so nonchalant about executions might be seen as barbaric by others, in contrast to the modern way of life.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the man is in a potentially life-threatening situation, he is more worried about his lunch plans than the fact that he is sitting in an electric chair. The joke highlights the mundane and sometimes ridiculous things that people worry about in the face of real danger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is so bored with his life that he's willing to sit in an electric chair (which suggests he's about to be executed). He's even more bored with his life if he's willing to cancel his lunch plans for the day. The joke plays on the idea that death is a way to escape from boredom.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the man's nonchalant attitude towards his impending execution. He's so bored with his job that he's actually looking forward to being executed in the electric chair, and so he tells his assistant to cancel his lunch date. The irony is that the electric chair is usually associated with death, not with boredom.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="159.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="161.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
