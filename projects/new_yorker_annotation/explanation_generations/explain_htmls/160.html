In this case, the man is warning the woman not to take a job with the company because the employee shown in the stockade likely received stock options as part of their compensation package, and it's likely that their stocks are now worthless because the company is doing poorly. The joke is clever because it's both a play on words and a warning about a bad investment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the word "stock": in business, "stock" can refer to a type of ownership in a company (stock options), but it can also refer to a physical item that can be used to confine a person's body (pillory). The man in the stocks is likely there as a form of punishment, and the joke is telling the woman to be careful in her own business dealings so she doesn't end up in the same predicament.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the stocks is literally being offered stock options, as in, the company he works for is offering him stock as part of his employee benefits package. However, given that he is in stocks (a physical restraint used to punish someone in the past), it is clear that he is not in a position to take advantage of that offer. As such, the joke is telling the other two people not to take the stock options being offered to them, because they, too, might end up in stocks.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in stocks (specifically, a pillory), people used to be put on public display as a form of punishment for their crimes. The phrase "stock options" is a business term that, in a very different context, refers to a type of benefits package that companies offer to their employees. The joke is clever because it takes the two very different meaning of the word "stock" and uses them to create a pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is warning the woman not to take a job with the company that has an employee locked up in a stockade. The stock options are a play on the word "stocks," as in the stocks that people were once locked in as punishment. The joke is clever because it's both a warning about working for a company with questionable ethics, and a pun on the word "stocks."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because stock options are a type of financial compensation that is often offered to employees as an incentive to stay with a company. In this case, the man in the stocks is literally being offered stock options as a form of payment, which is absurd because it would be very difficult to exercise those options while in stocks.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The stocks that the man is restrained in are a type of physical restraint, but they are also a type of investment. The joke is saying that you should avoid working for a company that offers stock options (a type of financial investment) if they are the type of company that would also use physical restraints on their employees.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is warning the woman not to take the company's stock options as part of her employment compensation, because she might end up like the man in the stockade. This is a clever way of warning someone not to "go public" with their criticisms of a company, because they might end up being punished.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "stock options" is a type of financial compensation that is often given to employees as an incentive. However, in this context, the word "stock" is being used in the same sense as it would be used in the phrase "stock market" or "stock prices": a stock is a type of securities that represents ownership in a company. Thus, the joke is saying that the man in stocks (who is presumably on display as a punishment) should avoid working for a company that offers stock options as compensation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. In this case, the word "stocks" can refer to both the physical restraints that the man is currently in, as well as the financialstocks that are often offered as benefits to employees. The joke is that, if you are offered stock options as part of a job, you should be wary, because the company might be in a bad financial situation (i.e., "stock" options might not be worth anything).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the stocks is literally being restrained by stocks, as in a financial investment, but the joke is saying that you should "pass" on the opportunity to invest in the company because it is not a good investment. This is a clever way to talk about something that is normally seen as unpleasant or negative in a positive light.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "stock options" the man is referring to are not the usual type of stock options given as an employee benefit, which are options to buy shares in the company at a discount. Rather, the "stock options" here are options for being locked in astocks, i.e., a punishment device consisting of a wooden frame with holes for the head and hands, in which victims were locked. The man is warning the woman not to accept such options from their employer.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is telling the woman that if the company offers stock options as part of their benefits package, she should probably decline. This is because a stock option is a type of equity compensation, which is given to employees as an incentive to stay with the company. However, the other meaning of "stock" is a physical restraint used to punish people, as in the phrase "in the stocks." So the man is also saying that if the company offers the option of being physically restrained and punished as part of their benefits package, she should probably decline.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is warning the woman not to accept a job offer from the company, given that they treat their employees so poorly. The joke is clever because "stock options" is a type of compensation that companies offer to employees, so the man is indirectly warning her not to take the job by telling her to avoid the "stock options."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in stocks is likely a financial worker, and so the stock options being offered by the company are probably not a good investment, given that the person in charge of them is in stocks! The joke is thus a play on the phrase "don't put all your eggs in one basket", meaning don't put all your resources into one venture, as it could fail.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="159.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="161.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
