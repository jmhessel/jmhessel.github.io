In this case, "little Italy" refers to a small section of the city that the monsters are destroy. The joke is clever because it's a double meaning: "little Italy" can also refer to a type of cuisine, which the monsters are literallySuggesting for dessert.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on "little" and " Italy." The two monsters are giant, so they would presumably eat a lot, and " Little Italy" is a neighborhood in many cities known for its restaurants. Thus, the joke is suggesting that the monsters could eat the whole neighborhood as "dessert."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The monster is asking if the other monster wants to eat the Little Italy section of the city for dessert, and the joke is that the monster pronounces "Italy" as "eye-taly", which sounds like "a tad unappetizing".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because after the dinosaurs have eaten all the buildings in the city, one of them suggests going to Little Italy for dessert. This is humorous because it's a play on words; Little Italy is a neighborhood in many cities known for its good Italian food.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Dessert" can mean both a type of food (usually something sweet after a meal) and the end of something. In this case, the reptile monsters are destroying the city, and the one monster suggests to the other that they eat the Little Italy section of town for "dessert".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the two dinosaurs are going to eat the city and then move on to another city for "dessert." This is absurd because, first, dinosaurs are not real and so they cannot be eating cities. Second, even if they were real, they would not eat cities because they are not large enough to consume an entire city.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the two monsters are eating a city, and the one monster suggests getting "Little Italy" for dessert. The joke is funny because "Little Italy" is both a place where one might get dessert, and also a small section of a city that could be eaten as dessert.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The two monsters are destroying (eating) the city, and the person making the joke is suggesting that they go to Little Italy for dessert. This is a play on words because "Little Italy" is both a neighborhood in many cities which is known for its Italian restaurants, and it is also a common nickname for the country of Italy. Thus, the person making the joke is suggesting that the monsters go to Italy for dessert.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two monsters are destroying a city, and the one monster asks if the other wants to go to Little Italy for dessert. This is funny because it is a normal human thing to do, but it is strange because the two monsters are destroying a city. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words: the phrase "little Italy" is usually used to describe a small area in a city with a lot of Italian restaurants, but in this context, it is a literal suggestion to eat the city's Italian section as dessert.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two dinosaurs are destroying a city, and one of them suggests going to Little Italy for dessert. This is funny because it's a play on words; Little Italy is a neighborhood in many cities that is known for its Italian food. So, the dinosaur is suggesting that they eat the neighborhood for dessert.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two monsters are destroying the city, and the one monster suggests going to Little Italy for dessert. This is funny because it's a juxtaposition of the destruction with the normalcy of suggesting a restaurant for dessert. Also, it's usually difficult to find parking in Little Italy, so the joke is also funny because of the irony of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a reference to the movie "Godzilla". In the movie, Godzilla is a giant reptile monster that attacks a city. Little Italy is an ethnic neighborhood in New York City that is known for its Italian restaurants. The joke is punning on the fact that the monster is eating a building in the city, and suggesting that the monster should eat something from Little Italy as dessert.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the calm, level-headed voice of the one monster asking about food options after they finish destroying the city, and the carnage that they have just caused. It's as if they're completely unconcerned with the destruction they've wrought, and are just focused on the next meal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the food "lasagna" which is a type of Italian food. The joke is also funny because of the absurdity of the situation: two giant monsters are destroying a city, and one of them suggests going to a specific part of the city for "dessert."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a play on words. The monster is happy because it gets to eat a lot of people, and the place it's destroying is called "Little Italy". The joke is also funny because it's a reference to a real place, which is known for its food. If the place the monster was destroying was called "Little Italy", then it would be funny because the monster would be eating a lot of food.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="202.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="204.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
