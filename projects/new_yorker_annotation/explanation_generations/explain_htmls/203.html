The bull is usually seen as a calm and docile animal, but the image shows it going berserk at the sight of the cows having tea. This is analogous to how some people get angry or jealous at the sight of their significant other enjoying themselves with someone else.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "seeing red," which often means being so angry that everything appears tinted red. In this case, the bull is actually seeing red (the color red), but it's not angry: instead, it's amorous. The joke is clever because it's a play on words.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="202.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="204.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
