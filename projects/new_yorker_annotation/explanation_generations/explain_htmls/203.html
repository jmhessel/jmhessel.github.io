The joke is a play on the fact that, in most cases, it would be the trespasser who would be expected to knock, not the property owner. But in this case, the man who was living in the tree was trespassing, so the joke is that he should have knocked before the lumberjacks found him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the man hiding in the trunk of the tree was doing so in order to avoid being seen, but given that the tree was being cut down, he would have been found anyway. The joke is clever because it puns on the word "knock": in this context, "to knock" means to make a sound with your fist on a door, but it can also mean to fell a tree.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the stump is telling the lumberjack that, next time, he should just knock instead of chopping down the tree. But, of course, the man in the stump is also telling the lumberjack that he should have knocked before entering his home, which is the tree stump. The joke is clever because it's a double meaning that is also a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man who was just cut out of the tree is telling the other man who cut him out, that next time, instead of just cutting down the tree, he should knock on it first. This is funny because it's a non-sequitur: the man who was just cut out of the tree doesn't have any reason to tell the other man how to do his job better, and the advice to knock on the tree before cutting it down doesn't make any sense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the stump was living there without the knowledge of the lumberjack who cut him down. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the man in the stump is telling the lumberjack that, next time, he should just knock on the stump before cutting it down, to make sure that no one is living in it. But the man in the stump is also saying that, next time, the lumberjack should knock on the door of the stump, to make sure that he is not home before cutting it down.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man with the saw probably knocked on the tree before cutting it down, as is customary. However, the man who was living in the tree obviously didn't want to be disturbed, and so he is telling the other man that next time, he should just knock on the stump instead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who was inside the tree was probably not expecting anyone to cut it down, let alone find him. The man who cut down the tree is telling him that, next time, he should just knock on the tree to let people know he's there before they cut it down.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who was just cut out of the tree is now free, and he is telling the lumberjack who cut him down that he could have just knocked on the tree to get his attention, rather than going through all the trouble of cutting it down. The joke is clever because it plays on the fact that normally, you would knock on a door to get someone's attention, but in this case, the man was inside the tree, so the lumberjack had to cut it down to get to him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a very polite thing to say to someone who has just accidentally disrupted your home. The man in the stump was living there, and the lumberjack just chopped down his tree without knocking first. The man in the stump is telling the lumberjack that, next time, he should just knock first, as a way of telling him that he was rude and should have been more considerate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. When you "knock on wood," it's for good luck, so the man inside the tree is telling the lumberjack to do that next time instead of just chopping the tree down. The man knocking on the tree would usually be the one who wants good luck, so it's ironic that in this situation, the man inside the tree is the one telling the lumberjack to knock on wood.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who was living in the stump presumably wanted to be left alone, and the lumberjack just went ahead and chopped the tree down without thinking. The man living in the stump is now homeless, and the joke suggests that he could have just knocked on the tree to let the lumberjack know he was there, rather than being rude and chopping it down.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man hiding in the tree trunk couldn't have known that the other man was going to cut the tree down, otherwise he would have knocked on the tree to warn him. The fact that he didn't knock is what led to the man getting stuck in the tree trunk, and the joke is that it was his own fault for not knocking.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man who was in the tree says "next time just knock" meaning that the next time the lumberjack wants to come in, he should just knock on the tree, instead of cutting it down. However, the man could also be telling the lumberjack to knock the tree down next time, instead of cutting it down.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it is possible to hide in a tree trunk, it would be very difficult to do so without being seen, especially if someone was cutting the tree down. The man in the hole must have been extremely desperate or foolish to try to hide there, and the person cutting the tree down is saying that next time, the man should just knock on the door instead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man sticking his head out of the stump is telling the lumberjack that next time, he should just knock on the stump before cutting it down, presumably to avoid harming any people who might be living inside of it. However, the word "knock" can also be used as a noun meaning "a blow from someone's fist," which is what the man in the stump probably just received. Thus, the joke is both a pun and a play on words.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
