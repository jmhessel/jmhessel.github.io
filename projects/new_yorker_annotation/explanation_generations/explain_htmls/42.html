The man says they will return when Cleveland, the city, wins a championship. However, the aliens misunderstand, and think he is saying they will return when Cleveland, the person, wins a championship. This is humorous because it's very unlikely that Cleveland, the person, will ever win a championship, especially given that he is a farmer.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man says that they promised to return when Cleveland won a championship, but what he really means is that the aliens promised to return the Cleveland Indians baseball team to their home planet. The team has a long history of losing, so the aliens must have been waiting a long time for this to happen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man went up to the spaceship expecting to be abducted, but the aliens instead returned him to Earth. This is a play on the common UFO conspiracy theory that aliens have abducted people and are holding them against their will on spaceships. In this case, the aliens are abducting people from Cleveland because the city hasn't won a championships in a long time.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="41.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="43.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
