Let him come up with a caption.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it takes the stereotype of the antiquated caveman who is behind the times and juxtaposes it against the stereotype of the ad executive who is always up on the latest trends. The caveman is said to be so behind the times that he needs an ad executive to tell him what to do, even though the ad executive is from a time period that is just as foreign to the caveman.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the suit is clearly out of place in the cave, and yet the cavepeople seem to be used to his presence. The joke suggests that the man in the suit is an advertising executive, and that the cavepeople are relying on him to come up with a caption for their cave painting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "come up with a caption" can mean either to write a caption for a picture or to come up with an idea. In this case, the businessman is being asked to come up with an idea, but because he is from a different time, he doesn't understand what they are talking about and instead offers to write a caption for the picture.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because typically, advertising executives are the ones who come up with slogans or campaigns for products, rather than the people who actually make the products. In this case, the man in the suit is probably from a more modern era, and the cave couple is from the prehistoric era. The joke is implying that the man in the suit is not qualified to come up with a caption for the cave painting, because he is not familiar with the time period or the context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a caveman is trying to sell advertising space on his cave to a businessperson from the future. The businessperson is presumably from a time when advertising is more sophisticated, and thus would be better equipped to come up with an advertising campaign for the cave. However, the caveman is already trying to sell the advertising space, which is why he's asking the businessperson for a caption.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The advertising executive is from the future, and so he's out of his time, just like the caveman. However, because he's an advertising executive, he's also in the business of coming up with slogans and captions, which is why the caveman suggests that he come up with a caption for the scene.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In the context of the scene, the advertising executive is trying to come up with a caption for the cave couple. However, the joke is also poking fun at the advertising industry, which is often accused of being out of touch with reality. The fact that the advertising executive is from a different time period than the cave couple only furthers this point.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it juxtaposes two images that are usually not thought of together: a caveman and a businessperson. The caveman is from a time period where advertising didn't exist, and the businessperson is from a time period where advertising does exist. The joke is also funny because it playfully pokes fun at the idea that businesspeople are the ones who come up with advertising campaigns, by suggesting that even a caveman could do it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The advertising executive being from a different time period implies that he is out of touch with the current market. Thus, when the caveman says "let him come up with a caption," he's saying that the advertising executive is too old and out-of-touch to understand what would be a funny caption for the picture.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. In this situation, the "caveman" is working on coming up with a caption for an ad. The joke is that the fancily-dressed man behind them is an advertising executive, and that he should be the one coming up with the caption, not the caveman.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is clearly not from the advertising executive's time period, yet the advertising executive wants the caveman to come up with a caption for whatever it is they are selling. It's a play on the idea that advertising executives are out-of-touch with what is trendy or popular.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in order to create a successful ad campaign, the man in the suit (an advertising executive) needs to come up with a clever and attention-grabbing caption. However, because he's from a different time period, he's not familiar with the cavemen's way of life, which makes it difficult for him to come up with an effective caption.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in today's society, it's very common for ad executives to come up with catchy phrases or slogans for products. However, the idea of an executive from today's worldexisting in a cave is ridiculous, so the joke is that the executive is probably not the best person to come up with a caption for the cave painting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the suit is clearly not a caveman, and yet he is in a cave. The other cavemen assume that he is some sort of advertising executive, and that his job is to come up with a caption or slogan for their cave.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the cave is a caveman, and the man on the rock is an executive, so the joke is that the executive is the one who should be coming up with the ideas, not the caveman.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
