This is a playful way to spice up their sex life by incorporating a bit of history and fantasy. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words: an archeologist is someone who studies mummies, so the woman in the scene is telling her partner to pretend to be an archeologist who is studying her mummy body.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because mummies are usually found in tombs and not in beds. The fact that these two people are in a bed mummified suggests that they are role-playing being mummies in an archeological excavation. This is an unusual situation because it's not often that people role-play being mummies in their bedroom.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The first meaning is that the couple is role-playing as an archaeologist and a mummy. The second meaning is that the couple is engage in a sex act where one person is pretending to be an archaeologist and the other is pretending to be a mummy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the classic mummy's curse: "Those who disturb the tomb shall be cursed." In this situation, the couple is playing a game where they pretend to be archeologists, and the joke is that the person who woke the mummy up (thus disturbing the tomb) is now the mummy, and the other person is the archeologist.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully addresses the taboo surrounding sex with corpses. The joke also suggests that sleeping with a mummy is a kind of kinky role-playing that people engage in.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "you're the archeologist this time" is a pun on the fact that mummies are often found in tombs and pyramids by archeologists. The fact that the mummies are in a bedroom implies that they are married, and the joke is that they are taking turns being the archeologist in their relationship.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "archeologist" can mean someone who studies ancient civilizations, or in this case, someone who has sex with mummies. The joke is that the people in the bedroom are so old that they have to switch roles during sex, with one person being the archeologist (the person who has sex with mummies) and the other person being the mummy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple in the bedroom are mummies, which are traditionally seen as being uninterested in sex. However, in this situation, they are trying to have sex with each other, but they are having trouble because they are so old and fragile. The joke is that, since they are both mummies, they can't really tell who is who, and so they have to take turns being the archeologist (the one who is examining the other).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The husband is saying that his wife should be the archeologist this time because she is the one who is better at it. However, the husband is also saying that his wife should be the one who is wrapped up in bandages like a mummy because she is the one who is better at it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "archeologist" can refer to someone who studies ancient civilizations, but it can also be a a type of safe sex where one partner wears a condom and the other partner does not. In this case, the mummies are using the safe sex method, but one of them is pretending to be an archeologist, which is a funny juxtaposition.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. When two mummies are having sex, one of them is typically the "top" and the other is the "bottom." However, in this case, because they are both mummies, they are unable to switch positions. As a result, the bottom mummy is telling the top mummy to switch positions with him so that he can be the top.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The couple in the bedroom are mummies, which are often found in archeological sites. However, in this case, the roles are reversed --- instead of the mummies being discovered by archeologists, the couple are pretending to be archeologists who have just discovered each other.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a reversal of typical roles, the wife is telling the husband that he is the one who has to go out and work as an archeologist. This is silly because, as mummies, they are likely thousands of years old and would not be able to hold modern jobs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "archeologist" is similar to the word "Egyptologist", and so the joke is that the two mummies are pretending to be archaeologists who are excavating a tomb. The tomb is their bedroom, and they are pretending to be digging it up and exploring it. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the fact that mummies are often found in tombs and archeologists excavate them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the juxtaposition of the two things that don't usually go together: mummies and bedroom. The mummy is usually found in tombs and not in people's bedroom, so the joke is surreal. Furthermore, the fact that the people are mummies implies that they are trying to have safe sex by wrapping themselves up, which is another absurd and funny detail.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
