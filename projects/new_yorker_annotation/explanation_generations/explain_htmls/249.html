He doesn't seem to find it strange that a whale is walking around a grocery store on land, which is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's an unlikely situation: a whale and an Amish man, two very different types of people, meeting up at a grocery store. The Amish man probably wouldn't be caught dead in a modern store, and the whale is out of his element, so to speak. The joke is further compounded by the fact that the whale is wearing a suit, which is even more incongruous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the whale is out of its natural habitat and the Amish man is in a modern store, which are both unusual situations. The joke suggests that the only place you would normally see the whale is at work, and the only place you would normally see the Amish man is outside of work. This is a play on the common saying "it's not what you know, it's who you know".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "outside of work" can mean either "not at work" or "in a different place than work." In this case, the Amish man is in a different place than work (a grocery store), but the whale is actually at work (in the water). Thus, the Amish man is saying that he didn't recognize the whale outside of the water, which is funny because the whale is a fish and should be in the water.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's usually Amish people who are known for not participating in modern conveniences like grocery stores, and not the other way around. The joke reverses the roles and has the supermarket shopper not recognize the Amish person outside of their work context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man dresses like an Amish person, who are known for not using many (or any) modern conveniences, yet here he is in a grocery store, using a shopping cart, which is a very modern convenience. It's even more unusual that he's not the only one doing it --- there's also a giant whale pushing a cart around as well!</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The Amish person is dressed like he is from a different time period, and the whale is, well, a whale. The joke is that the whale almost didn't recognize the Amish person out of work, because he is so used to seeing him in the water.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it suggests that the whale is working at the grocery store, which is absurd. The joke also plays on the contrast between the whale, which is a large and majestic creature, and the Amish man, who is a small and simple man. The pegged leg is also a contrast, as it is something that is often seen as old-fashioned.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people are in a grocery store, which is a place where people usually go to buy food. However, the whale is a mammal that lives in the water, and thus wouldn't need to buy food. The Amish man is also out of place because his religious beliefs meant that he doesn't use modern technology, which includes shopping at supermarkets.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Amish man and the whale are in an unexpected place (a grocery store) and the Amish man is dressed very differently from how he would normally be dressed. The joke is that the Amish man and the whale are actually co-workers who don't see each other very often, and the Amish man didn't recognize the whale outside of work.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Amish are known for their simple lifestyle and avoidance of modern technology. Seeing an Amish person in a grocery store, which is a very modern place, is strange. Even stranger is the fact that the Amish person is accompanied by a whale, which is an even more incongruous sight. The joke implies that the Amish person is out of their element, and the whale is even more so.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people are in a grocery store, and one of them is a whale. This is strange because whales are not typically found in grocery stores. The joke is also funny because the whale is out of its natural environment (in the water) and is doing something that is not typically associated with whales (pushing a grocery cart).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people are in an unusual situation. The whale is out of water, and the Amish man is in a modern store. The joke is that they are in such an unexpected place that they almost didn't recognize each other.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in Amish clothing is so out of place in the supermarket that he is mistaken for an employee. This is humorous because, in addition to being an unlikely shopper, the Amish are known for eschewing modern technology, which would make it very difficult for them to do their jobs in a grocery store.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected to see a whale in a grocery store, pushing a shopping cart. The joke relies on the contrast between the two customers: the whale, who is out of place, and the Amish man, who is in his element. The added detail of the peg leg makes the Amish man seem even more old-fashioned and out-of-touch with modernity.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="248.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="250.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
