It would look better on the other side.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man originally said he was going to put the boulder on one side of the hill, but then he changed his mind and said it would look better on the other side. However, the other side is actually the side that is further away from the woman, so he would have to exert more effort to get the boulder there.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. When someone says they "changed their mind," they usually mean they decided to do something different than what they originally planned. In this case, the man has actually changed the boulder, which is now on the other side of the mountain. The woman at the table is in the wrong time period, which is why she's surprised.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man says that he changed his mind about moving the boulder, but what he really means is that he changed his mind about the woman in the dress. He now thinks that she would look better on the other side, i.e., not sitting next to him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is pushing a boulder uphill, which is a famous story about the Greek character Sisyphus. In the story, Sisyphus is punished by being made to push a boulder up a hill, only to have it roll back down again. The woman's comment implies that she is also stuck in this punishment, but she has given up and decided that it doesn't matter which side of the hill the boulder is on.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the Sisyphean task, which is a task that is impossible to complete. In the Greek myth, Sisyphus was tasked with pushing a boulder up a hill, but it would always roll back down again. The man in the picture is likely experiencing the same thing, but he seems to have given up and is now drinking alcohol. The woman in the dress is out of place because she is dressed formally, while the man is not, and because she is not doing anything to help him with his task.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the Sisyphean task of rolling a boulder up a mountain, only to have it roll down again. In the joke, the old man says that he changed his mind, which implied that he was going to try to roll the boulder up the mountain again, only to have it roll down again. The joke is a commentary on the futility of the task.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully subverts the legend of Sisyphus. In the myth, Sisyphus is condemned to roll a boulder up a mountain for eternity; the boulder always rolls down again just before he reaches the top. In this variation, the old man changes his mind about where he wants to put the boulder, which is a small act of defiance against his fate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the Greek myth of Sisyphus, who was tasked with rolling a boulder up a hill only to have it roll back down again. In the myth, Sisyphus is punished for his hubris, but in this joke, the man is not being punished; he's just changed his mind about where he wants to put the boulder. The joke is clever because it uses the familiar story to create a new punchline.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it references the Greek myth of Sisyphus, who was condemned to push a boulder up a hill only to have it roll back down again. The man in the picture is presumably in the same situation, and he has made the decision to change his mind and attempt to push the boulder up the hill from the other side. This is humorous because it's a pointless task, but the man is hoping that by changing his approach, he'll be successful.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the Greek legend of Sisyphus, who was condemned to roll a boulder up a hill for eternity. The joke is clever because it uses the word "mind" in two ways: the first is a play on the phrase "to change one's mind", and the second is a play on the phrase "to keep one's mind on the task at hand". In the context of the legend, the joke is clever because Sisyphus is constantly changing his mind about which side of the hill the boulder should go, and he can never keep his mind on the task at hand because he is bored out of his mind from doing the same thing over and over again.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man pushing the boulder up the mountain is trying to move it to the other side, but the woman at the table is telling him that it would look better on the other side, meaning that he should leave it where it is. The boulder and the woman are in different time periods, which is why the woman's advice is confusing to the man.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man pushing the boulder is very tired, and the woman at the table is telling him that he should have placed the boulder on the other side of the hill. This is a play on the Sisyphean task, which is a task that is impossible to complete, such as pushing a boulder up a hill. In this case, the joke is that the man is so tired that he is willing to switch sides and push the boulder up the other side of the hill, even though it will be just as difficult.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is pushing a boulder uphill, which is a famously impossible task. The woman's comment implies that he's been doing this for a long time, and she's getting bored. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the phrase "the grass is always greener on the other side," which means that people often think that things are better elsewhere when they are actually not.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is saying that he changed his mind about where he wants the boulder to go, but the woman Misheard him and thinks he's saying that he changed his outfit and wants to see how he looks on the other side. This is funny because it's a non-sequitur.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the stereotype of women as being indecisive. The man is trying to move the boulder to the other side of the mountain, but the woman tells him to stop, saying that it would look better on the other side. This is a classic example of a woman changing her mind, which is what the joke is referencing.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
