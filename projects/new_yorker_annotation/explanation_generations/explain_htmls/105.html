The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the Grim Reaper is known for "reaping" souls, and a knuckleball can be "tricky" to hit.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the grim reaper, who is usually associated with death, is playing a game that is typically considered to be very safe. However, the fact that he is playing catch with a knuckleball, which is a type of pitch that is notoriously difficult to control, means that there is a potential for injury (and thus death). The joke is also funny because it is a play on words: the phrase "watch out for the knuckleball" is typically used to warn batters of the pitch, but in this case, it is literal advice to avoid the ball because it could kill you.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="104.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="106.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
