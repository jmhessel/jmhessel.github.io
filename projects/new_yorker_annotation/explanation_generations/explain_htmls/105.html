This is a play on words because "you didn't mention" can also mean "you forgot to mention".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is looking at the knight, who is wearing glasses, and says that he didn't mention that he wears glasses. However, the knight is not wearing glasses, and is instead looking at the woman through a magnifying glass. This is a way of saying that the woman is examining the knight closely, and perhaps finding him wanting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the old stereotype that people who wear glasses are nerds. The fact that the man is wearing a suit of armor makes him even more nerdy, and the woman's disappointment is exaggerated because of it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in medieval times, people who wore glasses were often ridiculed because they were seen as being weak or nerdy. However, in modern times, glasses are seen as pretty normal, and even stylish in some cases. So, the fact that the woman is surprised that her date wears glasses implies that she either doesn't know much about Medieval times, or that she herself is pretty old-fashioned.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's date is disappointed that he's wearing glasses, which she apparently didn't know about. However, the man is wearing a suit of armor, which is much more significant than the glasses. The suit of armor is probably a deal-breaker for most people, but the man didn't mention it, which is why the woman is so disappointed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because when people go on dates, they try to present themselves in the best possible light. Wearing glasses is often seen as a negative, because it makes someone look nerdier or less attractive. The woman on the date probably didn't mention she wore glasses because she wanted the knight to like her for who she is, not just her looks. The knight's response implies that he would have preferred she didn't wear glasses, which surprises and likely disappoints the woman.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in most cases, people don't wear glasses in medieval times. However, the woman's comment implies that she is traditional and would have preferred if her date had told her he wore glasses earlier, as it is something she would have liked to have known.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the suit of armor is a metaphor for the man being "armored" emotionally, i.e., not being open and vulnerable. The woman is disappointed because she was hoping to connect with him on a deeper level, but his emotional armor is preventing that. The glasses are a metaphor for the man's "true self" being hidden behind the armor; by not mentioning that he wears glasses, he's not being completely honest about who he is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is talking to the knight, and she says "you didn't mention you wear glasses", which could be interpreted two ways. The first way is that the knight is wears glasses, and the woman didn't know that. The second way is that the knight is supposed to wear a visor, but he doesn't have one on, which is why she can see his glasses. Either way, the woman is surprised by the knight's appearance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's date is disappointed that he didn't mention that he wears glasses, as if it's a dealbreaker. However, the man is wearing a full suit of armor, which is a much more significant issue than the fact that he wears glasses. The joke is clever because it plays on the idea that we often focus on small, inconsequential details when looking for a partner, when there are much more important things to consider.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully questions the man's sincerity. He's clearly trying to impress his date by wearing a suit of armor, but the fact that he's wearing glasses undermines the whole effect. It's as if he's saying "I would have looked more knightly if you had just told me you wear glasses."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is disappointed that their date wears glasses. This is usually not a big deal, but in this case, it's a problem because the date is wearing a suit of armor, which makes it difficult to eat and drink. If the speaker had known that the date wore glasses, they could have planned ahead and brought food that didn't require utensils.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "You wear glasses" can mean two things: that the person wears eyeglasses, or that the person is dressed formally in a suit (i.e., they "wear glasses"). In this case, it's the latter meaning that is intended, but the woman looks disappointed, implying she was hoping for the former meaning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is disappointed that her date is wearing glasses, which is a common enough complaint. However, the fact that he's wearing a suit of armor amplifies her disappointment, because it suggests that he was trying to hide the fact that he wears glasses by wearing a helmet.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. When people go on first dates, they often try to hide any imperfections they have; however, the man in this situation is literally wearing his imperfections on his sleeve (or rather, his head). Wearing glasses is often seen as a sign of intelligence, but in this case it just means that the man can't see well.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="104.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="106.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
