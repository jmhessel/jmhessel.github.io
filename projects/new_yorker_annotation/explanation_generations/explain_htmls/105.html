In this context, the man on the cloud is saying that he didn't get promoted in his job as a "squeegee-man" (someone who cleans the windows on planes) because his plans (to move up in the company) didn't work out. However, the fact that he is in the sky next to an airplane re-contextualizes the phrase "to pan out": in this context, it means that his plans went so badly that he ended up stranded on a cloud.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man hitchhiking is trying to get a ride on the plane, but he is not in a position to actually do so because he is a squegee-man, someone who cleans the windows of the plane. The joke is clever because it uses a play on words: the man is trying to "hitch a ride" on the plane, but he is actually in the process of being "hitched" to the plane via his job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a joke about the man's career, or lack thereof. He was working as a "senior squeegee-man", which is a made-up title, during flight simulations. Presumably, he was responsible for keeping the windows clean. He didn't get promoted, and so he's now hitchhiking on a cloud. The joke is clever because it takes a real-world job (being a janitor) and applies it to a surreal situation (hitchhiking on a cloud).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is hitchhiking on a cloud, which is realistically impossible. The man is likely a former employee of an airplane company who was laid off when the company switched to flight simulations, which don't require human employees. The man's current situation, being stranded on a cloud, is analogous to his former situation of being laid off and unemployed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because planes typically don't fly near hitchhikers, let alone pick them up. The joke is making a play on words with the phrase "as senior squeegee-man" which is a position on an airplane (someone who cleans the windows during flight), and the fact that he "didn't pan out" meaning he wasn't successful.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is hitchhiking on a cloud, which is something that doesn't actually exist in the real world. He is doing this because he was previously a senior squeegee-man during flight simulations, but he was unable to get a promotion to an actual pilot position. The joke is clever because it uses the pun "pan out," which can mean both "succeed" and "be seen from above."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is hitchhiking, but instead of a normal thumb outstretched to ask for a ride, he is using a squeegee, which is an implement often used to clean windows. Thus, he is asking for a ride by simulating the action of cleaning a window on an airplane, which is something that would never actually happen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the hitchhiker is in a situation that is impossible. He's either very lucky that he's managed to find a cloud to hitchike on, or he's very unlucky that he's stuck on a cloud in the middle of nowhere. The joke plays on the fact that the impossible situation is just a simulation, and that the man is only a senior squeegee-man, implying that his career has not progressed as he might have hoped.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully comments on the ridiculousness of the scene. The man is hitchhiking on a cloud, which is impossible, and he's been passed by a plane, which means he's very high up in the sky. The joke suggests that he was possibly a janitor at a flight simulator company, and that's how he ended up in this situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the double meaning of the word "pan." In this context, "pan out" can mean either to succeed or, because the man is on a cloud, to fall down. The joke is that the man's career didn't go as planned: he was a senior squeegee-man (someone who cleans the outside of windows), but he got passed over for a promotion and is now stuck hitchhiking in the sky.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at the air travel industry's treatment of employees. The man in the clouds is a former employee of an airline who was in charge of cleaning the windows (a job that is essential for the pilot to have a clear view), but he was let go during cost-cutting measures. The fact that he is now reduced to hitchhiking on clouds is a comedic contrast to his previous job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at the fact that the man is hitchhiking in the sky, which is impossible. The joke is also a play on words, as the man is a "senior squeegee-man", meaning he is in charge of cleaning the windows on the plane, but he is also "senior" in the sense that he is old. The fact that he didn't "pan out" contradicts the usual connotation of the phrase, which is that the man was successful.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully mocks the man's current situation. The man is hitchhiking in the sky, which is an impossible feat, and he is doing so via an equally impossible means (standing on a cloud). The man must have been "down on his luck" to have ended up in this situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man on the cloud is hitchhiking, and the plane that flies by is a "pan-am" plane. The man's former job was as a squeegee-man, which is someone who cleans windows. The joke is thus that the man didn't get promoted at his old job, and is now reduced to hitchhiking on clouds.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it references the movie "Up", in which a man ties helium balloons to his house and flies away. The joke is that, instead of having a fulfilling life like the man in "Up", the man on the cloud is stuck doing a job that isn't very glamorous.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="104.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="106.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
