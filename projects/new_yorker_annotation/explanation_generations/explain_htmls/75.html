The joke is clever because "protection" can refer to both condoms and birth control pills.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man with his arms crossed is talking about how he got his colleague pregnant, and he explains that he was using protection --- in this case, a condom. However, the other man interprets this as meaning that the colleague was telling him she was pregnant before they had sex, which is not what the first man meant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's colleague is telling him about a conversation he had with a woman, in which she said she had protection (a contraceptive), but the colleague misheard and thought she said she was pregnant. The joke is sexually suggestive and also plays on the fact that the man with the huge belly looks pregnant himself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the large stomach is saying that he was told his colleague had protection (most likely a condom), but it's obvious that she was lying because he got her pregnant. This is a common joke format where someone says something that has a double meaning, but the second meaning is more obvious than the first.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is talking about his colleague's "abdominal obesity" as if it is a pregnancy. This is a clever way of making a fat joke without being too offensive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the first man is talking about how his colleague got pregnant, and how he was assured that she had protection (i.e., a condom). However, the second man is clearly pregnant, which means that the protection didn't work. This is a play on words, as the protection the first man is talking about (a condom) is different from the protection the second man is referring to ( birth control pills).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man thought his colleague was referring to birth control when she said she had "protection." In reality, she was referring to the fact that she is pregnant, and the baby is the one providing protection (i.e., the baby is a form of birth control).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's huge belly makes it look like he's pregnant. The other man is saying that he was also fooled by a woman who said she had birth control, implying that the man got the woman pregnant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "protection" can mean multiple things. It can refer to a condom, which would prevent the man from getting his colleague pregnant. However, it can also refer to something else --- e.g., a stomach bulge --- which in this case, would not prevent the colleague from getting pregnant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of the word "protection." In this context, "protection" could refer to either a condom, which would prevent the colleague from getting pregnant, or a bulletproof vest, which would protect the colleague from getting shot. However, given the context of the situation, it is most likely that the colleague is referring to a condom, which makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the large belly is pregnant, and the other man is his colleague. The colleague's joke implies that the man got his wife pregnant, even though she was on birth control. The joke is also funny because it uses the word "protection" in two different ways: birth control protects against pregnancy, and a colleague is someone who is supposed to protect you at work.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is talking about his colleague's impending fatherhood as if it were an STD. In other words, he's joking that the colleague got someone pregnant despite using a condom. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the colleague is going to be a father, so he has a "protection" in the form of a child.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of the word "protection." In this context, "protection" could refer to either a condom, which would prevent pregnancy, or a shield, which would protect the man's belly from being poked. However, given the situation, it is more likely that the man is referring to a condom, as he is worried about the other man's pregnant-looking belly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the large stomach is saying that he was told his colleague had protection (implying against getting pregnant), but it turns out that the colleague was referring to a physical barrier like a condom rather than, say, birth control pills.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is pregnant, and the other man is surprised. The first man is referring to the fact that he is wearing a belt, and the second man thinks he is referring to a condom. The fact that the first man is pregnant is unexpected, and the fact that the second man misunderstood his meaning is also unexpected.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="74.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="76.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
