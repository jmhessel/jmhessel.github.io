Now.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The person speaking is saying that unicorns don't exist, which is true, but they also don't exist now, implying that they used to exist. This is a humorous way of pointing out the absurdity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is saying that the reason unicorns don't exist is because they've been hunted to extinction. The speaker is implying that, if humans had just left them alone, unicorns would still exist. The joke is also a play on the common saying "nowhere to be found" by saying that unicorns are "now" extinct.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Now" can mean either "at this present moment in time" or "the present situation". In this context, the joke is saying that the trophy heads on the wall don't exist anymore (because they've been killed and mounted), but they did exist at one point.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "now" can mean two things: "at this present moment" or "previously." In this context, the joke is saying that unicorns didn't exist previously, but they do now. This is a clever way of saying that the person is looking at a deer head, which is a type of animal that does exist.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The person speaking is saying that, of course, unicorns don't exist now because they're all dead; they've been killed and their heads are on the wall as trophies. This is a sadder but more accurate view of unicorn hunting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is saying that, of course, unicorns don't exist now because they were hunted to extinction. In other words, the only reason unicorns don't exist now is because they used to exist, and were hunted by humans. This is a silly statement because it's logically backwards: the reason they don't exist now is because they never existed, not because they were hunted.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "unicorn" can mean both the mythical creature that doesn't exist, and also a term for something that is rare and valuable. In this context, the person is saying that unicorns don't exist, meaning that the mythical creature doesn't exist. But they also saying that unicorns don't exist now, meaning that even though the mythical creature doesn't exist, the unicorn heads (which are rare and valuable) do exist.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "now" can mean either "at this present time" or "as a result of what has happened previously." In this context, the person is saying that unicorns don't exist "at this present time" because they've been hunted to extinction.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of the room with the mounted unicorn head, the speaker is saying that unicorns don't exist... but they did at one point, or else there wouldn't be a mounted unicorn head. The speaker is implying that the person who killed the unicorn is now responsible for their extinction.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "now" can mean either "at this present moment in time" or "the previously mentioned thing does not exist." In this joke, the meaning is "at this present moment in time unicorns do not exist." However, the fact that there are unicorn heads on the wall implies that they at one point did exist, and were likely hunted for their horns.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The literal meaning of the joke is that the three mounted trophy heads - the deer, the unicorn, and the bull - are not alive now, they are just dead heads. But the joke could also be interpreted to mean that unicorns never existed at all, and that the person who killed the unicorn and put its head on display is just delusional.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of a unicorn head being mounted on a wall. Unicorns are mythical creatures that have never been proven to exist, so it would be impossible to kill one and taxidermy its head. The joke playfully imagines a world in which unicorns once did exist, but have since gone extinct.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it takes the existence of the mythical unicorn for granted, and tries to explain away the hunters' success by saying that they killed it "now", implying that at some point in the past, unicorns did exist. This rivals the implausibility of the hunters being able to kill a unicorn in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The unicorns on the wall don't exist, but they existed at some point in the past when they were killed and their heads were mounted on the wall. The person who made the joke is punning on the fact that they don't exist now.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "now" can mean two different things: the present moment, or the act of head-butting someone. In this case, the latter meaning is implied, as in, the person only knows that unicorns don't exist because they've just been hit on the head with a unicorn trophy.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
