The jokee is so used to eating destructively that they don't see the current situation as out of the ordinary, and so they just ask for a beer as if they were at a bar or a barbecue.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it's not unusual for monsters to be rampaging through a city and destroying buildings, it is unusual for them to request a beer while they are doing it. The contrast between the devastation they are causing and the casual request for a beer is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the person who made the cartoon thinks that dinosaurs are still around and that they are eating buildings. This is a silly idea, because dinosaurs have been extinct for millions of years.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur. The dinosaurs are devouring a city, and the one dinosaurs asks the other to pass him a truck. It's unexpected, and doesn't make sense in the context, which is what makes it humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it's normal for monsters to destroy buildings and eat people in fiction, it's less common for them to request specific items while they are doing it. In this case, the monster asks for a beer truck, which is an unexpected but not entirely unreasonable request given the situation. The juxtaposition of the destruction with the mundane request is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur. In the context of the situation, the speaker is asking for a beer truck to be passed to them, seemingly expecting that there would be one available, even though that doesn't make any sense. The joke is made funnier by the fact that the speaker is a dinosaur, which makes it even more incongruous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The first meaning of "beer truck" is a truck that delivers beer. However, the second meaning is a Truck, which is a type of vehicle. In this context, the joke is funny because the person is asking for a vehicle to help them eat the city, which is similar to how a truck would help someone eat a lot of food.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a nonchalant request made in the middle of a city being destroyed by dinosaurs. The person asking for the beer is so unfazed by the situation that they are more concerned with drinking beer than with running for their lives. This humorous contrast makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is so nonchalant about the dinosaur eating a building. It's as if this is a commonplace event that happens often enough that he's not surprised or scared by it. He's just casually watching and waiting for the show to be over so he can go about his business. Asking for a beer truck implies that he plans to drink while he watches.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur. The person who made the joke is likely responding to the situation in a way that doesn't make sense, or is making a joke that's unrelated to the situation. In this case, the joke is about how the person wants to drink beer, even though there's a dinosaur devouring a city. This is humorous because it's a contrast to the seriousness of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is asking for a beer truck to be passed to him while he is in the middle of devouring a city. This is absurd because it's a non-sequitur: the speaker is focused on the task at hand, and asking for a beer would be a distraction. Furthermore, it's unlikely that there would be a beer truck nearby in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the rampaging monsters is asking the other for a beer truck. The irony is that they are destroying the city and yet one of them is still thinking about having a beer, even though there's probably not going to be any beer left after they're done demolishing everything.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a nonchalant request made in the midst of destruction. The contrast between the casual words and the chaotic situation make it humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non sequitur. In the context of two dinosaurs devouring a city, the question of whether or not to pass a beer truck is completely unrelated and unexpected, and thus, humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a nonchalant response to the destruction being caused by the dinosaurs. The joke-teller is more concerned with getting a drink than with the fact that two giant monsters are destroying the city.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
