However, in this context, "restraint" refers to the physical restraining devices that the two people are wearing. The joke is clever because it's a play on words that also happens to be true in the literal sense: the people in the office are literally restrained, so they must value restraint (the physical restraint device) above all else.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the women are wearing straightjackets, which are meant to restrict movement, and yet they are still able to conduct a business meeting. This joke implies that the women are so restrained in their daily lives that even being in a straightjacket doesn't stop them from working.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "restraint" can mean both self-control and a physical restraint used to control someone's body movements. In this case, the two people are wearing straitjackets, which are a type of physical restraint, and they are saying that they value restraint, meaning self-control. This is funny because it is a paradox.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people in the office are wearing straitjackets, which are restraint devices used to prevent people from moving their arms or legs. The fact that they are in straitjackets implies that they are not in control of themselves, which is the opposite of what you want in an office setting. Nevertheless, one of the people says that they "value restraint" above all else, which is ironic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people who are interviewing for the job are restrained in straight jackets, which goes against the usual practice of an interview, where the interviewee is expected to be on their best behavior. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words, as the word "restraint" can mean both self-control and the physical act of restraining someone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The office workers are in "restraint" because they are literally restrained by the straight jackets, but they are also exhibiting restraint in their behavior. This is a contrast to the usual image of office workers, who are often seen as being stressed out and having little self-control.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Restraint" can mean both the physical act of restraining someone in a straightjacket, as well as a quality that is valued in business settings, such as behaving in a calm and professional manner. The fact that the women are in straightjackets emphasizes the contrast between the two meanings of the word.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two women in straightjackets are talking in an office, and one of the women is behind a desk. This implies that the office is a mental institution, and that the woman behind the desk is the doctor. The joke is making fun of the fact that people in mental institutions are often considered to be crazy, or out of control.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "restraint" can mean both keeping oneself under control and a type of device used to physically restrict movement. In this context, the interviewers are saying that they value self-control in their employees, but the fact that they are both wearing straight jackets implies that they may not be the best people to take that advice from.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because straitjackets are used to restrain people, usually because they are considered to be a danger to themselves or others. The people in the office are wearing straitjackets, which implies that they are not in control of themselves, which is not the professional image that most businesses strive for.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "restraint" can mean both self-control and the physical act of restraining someone. Therefore, the joke is both a comment on the ridiculousness of the situation (two people being restrained in straight jackets in an office) and a play on the words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "restraint" can mean both the act of keeping oneself under control as well as a physical restraint like a straitjacket. In this context, the interviewer is telling the interviewee that they should keep themselves under control, but the fact that they are both straitjacketed implies that they are not in control of themselves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The straight jackets are a physical restraint, and the word "restraint" can also mean self-control or discipline. The fact that the people who are interviewing for the job are the ones who need to be restrained is ironic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The people in the office are restrained by the straight jackets they are wearing, but they are also restrained in their behavior because they are professional. The joke is that, despite the fact that they are physically restrained, they are still behaving in a restrained, or professional, manner.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "restraint" has two meanings: the physical restraint of being confined in a straitjacket, and the psychological restraint of self-control. In this case, the two people in the office are both restrained in a physical sense (by the straitjackets) and in a psychological sense (by their need to keep their cool in a high-stress situation).</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="207.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="209.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
