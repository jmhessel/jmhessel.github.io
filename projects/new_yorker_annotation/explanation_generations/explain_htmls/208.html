He is probably a writer, and the pirates are discussing how they are going to kill him and take his possessions. The fact that they are considering killing him for his cat is absurd, and the joke is poking fun at how pirates are often stereotyped as being ruthless and violent.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the cat is sitting on what is presumably the pirate captain's chair, and the pirate captain is not pleased. The joke is a play on the fact that, in many stories, the pirate captain is a gruff and intimidating figure, but in this case, he's been usurped by a man with a cat. This is funny because it's a reversal of the power dynamic that is usually seen in stories involving pirates.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the cat is a writer, and he is bemoaning the fact that he will never be able to write a good pirate story now that he's seen a real pirate ship. The joke is clever because it playfully subverts the stereotype of the "crazy cat lady" by instead making the cat the source of the man's inspiration.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="207.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="209.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
