The city of Detroit is known for its car manufacturing, and the phrase "by golly" is often used to express surprise. So, the joke is that the car factory is in Detroit, and they are making a new type of car that has icing on it, which is surprising.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "back": in one sense, the auto industry in Detroit, Michigan, USA, has been struggling in recent years, so the joke could be interpreted as a sarcastic comment on the current state of the auto industry. However, the other sense of "back" is that the final step in the car-making process is putting icing "on" the cars, which is not something that is typically done, so the joke could also be interpreted as a comment on the absurdity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "by golly" is often used to express surprise or amazement. Here, the speaker is surprised at how the Detroit car factories are doing, but instead of making normal cars, they are making cars with icing on them. This is unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. Icing on the cake is often used as a metaphor for something that makes a good situation even better. Here, the joke is that the workers have added something superfluous to the cars --- icing --- making them into "cakes" rather than cars. The joke implication is that the workers are so incompetent that they can't even make cars anymore, only cakes.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The city of Detroit is known for being the center of the American automotive industry. However, in recent years, it has been in decline, with many car factories closing. The speaker in the joke is saying that the factory is doing well because it has come up with a new innovation: putting icing on cars. This is a silly idea, of course, but it makes the joke funnier because it is a possible way that Detroit could try to revive its automotive industry.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The city of Detroit is known for being the "Motor City" because it used to be a major hub for automobile manufacturing. However, the Detroit car industry has been in decline in recent years. The joke suggests that the car factory putting icing on the cars is a sign that Detroit is "back" because they are doing something innovative and different. However, the fact that the cars have icing on them is still strange and unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because icing on cars is an extremely unnecessary luxury item. It's a sign of wealth and status to have icing on your car, which is something that people associate with Detroit: a city that was once a symbol of American industrial might, but has since fallen on hard times. The joke is that the luxury item of icing on cars is a sign that Detroit is making a comeback.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "By golly" is often used to express surprise or incredulity. The joke is clever because it is true that Detroit, which is known for its car manufacturing, has been struggling economically in recent years. However, the joke implies that the workers at this factory are so surprised by the random addition of icing to the cars that they think Detroit, as a whole, must be doing better than they thought. The joke is clever because it pokes fun at the city's struggling economy while also offering a potential solution: perhaps if all car factories in Detroit added icing to their cars, the city would make a comeback.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The manager is excited because the machine is putting icing on the cars, which he views as a sign that the car company is doing well. However, the joke is also a jab at the city of Detroit, which has been in decline in recent years. The play on words relies on the fact that "icing" can refer to both the act of decorating a cake with frosting, and also slang for a diamond (as in "put a ring on it"). In other words, the manager is excited because the factory is finally putting "diamonds" on the cars, which is a sign of the company's success.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the workers on the assembly line are putting icing on the cars, which is an unusual thing to do. The joke suggests that the city of Detroit, which is known for making cars, is making a comeback because the factory is doing something different and creative.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "By golly" is a phrase people say when they are surprised or delighted, and in this case, the person is surprised and delighted because the car factory is doing something strange (putting icing on the cars). However, the joke is also funny because "by golly" sounds a lot like "body" and so the phrase can be interpreted to mean that the workers are putting icing on the cars because they are putting the finishing touches on the product.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is an example of a non-sequitur. The workers in the factory are putting icing on the cars, which is an unusual and unexpected thing to do. The man in the suit says "By golly, Detroit is back!", which doesn't make any sense in relation to what is happening. The joke is funny because it is unexpected and doesn't make any sense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the implication is that the workers at this car factory have never seen icing before, and are amazed that the final product has it. Detroit is known for its automotive industry, so the joke is that this car factory, with its unusual product, is representative of the city's comeback.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. When people say "by golly," they usually mean something like "wow" or "I can't believe it." In this case, the phrase "by golly" is actually referencing the act of putting icing on the cars, which is a silly and unexpected thing to do. The joke is clever because it's easy to miss the double-meaning at first, and only realize it once the punchline is delivered.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "By golly" is often used to express disbelief, e.g., "I can't believe it's already Wednesday, by golly!" In this case, the speaker is surprised that the car factory is doing something so silly as putting icing on the cars --- but, because they're in Detroit, perhaps it makes sense after all.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
