This could be interpreted in a few ways: either she's implying that the cat is so regal and commanding that it makes her want to have a child (who would presumably be just as majestic), or she's saying that the cat is so lazy and fat that it makes her want to have a child (who would presumably be less lazy and fat). In either case, the contrast between the cat and a human child is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple may be considering having a child because their cat has been crowned king. They see how happy their cat is and maybe they want to experience the same happiness. The joke is also funny because it's unexpected; we don't usually think of having a baby when we think of becoming kings or queens.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the word "kid." A "kid" is both a baby goat and a child. So, the couple is joking that maybe it's time for them to have a baby, since they already have a "kid" (a cat) who is acting like a king.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the couple is so enamored with their cat that they are considering having a child that would be just like their cat. The absurdity is that, of course, you cannot have a child that is exactly like a cat, though perhaps they want a pet that is more like a family member.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "kid" can mean a baby goat, or a human child. In this situation, the couple looks on as their pet cat is "crowned king," and one of them jokes that maybe it's time for them to have a "kid" --- i.e., a human child. The wordplay is made funnier by the fact that, usually, when people have kids, it's because they want to, not because they have a pet that gets crowned king.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the cat is now the head of the family, and that the couple may want to have a child so that the child will be subordinate to the cat. This is a play on the traditional roles of children and parents, with the addition of the cat as a new family member.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is looking at the cat in the throne and discussing how it's time for them to have a baby, as if the cat is their child. This is a play on words, as the cat is both fat ("chubby") and a "king," making him a "chubby king."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur. In the context of the situation, the cat being dressed like a king doesn't have anything to do with the man and woman having a kid. However, the joke works because of the incongruity between the cat being a king and the man and woman having a kid.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is considering having a child, but they are doing so while their cat is lounging on a chair like a king. This implies that the cat is currently the center of their world and they may not be ready to have a human child yet.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the woman is looking at the cat with concern, the man says that maybe it's time they had a kid. The joke is playing on the idea that, when people have a pet, sometimes they will say that the pet is like a child to them. In this case, the man is saying that the cat is like a child, but also that maybe it's time for them to have an actual child, implying that the cat isn't enough for them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is suggesting that they have a child to compete with the cat for attention. The cat is dressed up like a king, signifying that he is the center of attention in the house, and the man is suggesting that they have a child to vie for attention with the cat. This is humorous because it's an unexpected solution to the problem, and because it's an extreme solution.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reversal of roles. In this scene, the cat is acting like a king on his throne, while the man and woman are sitting below him like commoners. The man then suggests that maybe it's time to have a baby, implying that the cat is acting like a king so much that he may as well be one.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non sequitur. The two people in the room are discussing whether or not to have a kid, and the cat, who is dressed up like a king, has no say in the matter. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: a "kid" is both a baby goat and a child, so the cat, who is king, is literally being asked if it's time for them to have a baby goat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple's reaction to their cat being crowned king is to laugh and think about having children, as if it's the most normal thing in the world. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the couple is crowned "king" and "queen", which are usually titles given to a man and woman when they have a child. So, the joke is implying that having a child is the natural next step after their cat is crowned king.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it suggests that the couple is considering having a child, but they are only considering it because the cat is acting more regally than they are. In other words, they feel like they need to have a child in order to outrank the cat in terms of importance/authority in the household.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="78.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="80.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
