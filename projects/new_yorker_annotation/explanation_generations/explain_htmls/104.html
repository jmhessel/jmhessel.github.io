The therapist is therefore saying that the next time they should meet, the car will need to come back in 5,000 miles to get more gasoline, which is the functional equivalent of a human needing to come back in a week or two for another session.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is treating the car as if it's a person who has been coming to see him regularly. In this context, the phrase "I'd like to see you again in 5,000 miles" is a pun on the fact that cars need to go to the mechanic every 5,000 miles or so for a tune-up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is talking to the car as if it is a regular patient. Cars need gasoline to run, not therapy, so the therapist's suggestion that the car come back in 5,000 miles is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's absurd that a car would go to therapy, and even more absurd that the therapist would try to charge it for another session. The therapist is playfully trying toCharge the car, as if it could actually pay, by saying that the next session will be in 5,000 miles, which is how often cars need to get their oil changed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it puns on the fact that 5,000 miles is a long way, and also the fact that electric cars need to be recharged after driving a certain amount of miles. The therapist sees the car as a patient that needs help, but the car is also a vehicle that needs to be refueled. The contrast between the two meanings is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the car is an inanimate object and therefore cannot come back in 5,000 miles. The fact that the psychiatrist is talking to the car as if it is a patient and making aappointment for a follow-up visit is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the words "I'd like to see you again." In this case, the therapist is telling the electric car that he wants to see it again in 5,000 miles, which is a long way for a car to travel. This is a way of saying that the therapist doesn't think the car will be back, or that the car has 'run out of time.'</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The therapist is talking to the car, which needs to be taken care of every 5,000 miles, and is saying that she wants to see the car again in 5,000 miles. This is a clever way of saying that the therapist wants to see the car again in 5,000 miles for a check-up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully acknowledges the unusual situation (a car in a therapist's office) while also making a pun on the common phrases "I'd like to see you again" (which signals romantic interest) and "in 5,000 miles" (which signals the distance one would have to travel to see the other person again).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because 5,000 miles is a long way to travel and it would be unrealistic for the therapist to see the car again so soon. However, this is a realistic amount of time for a car to travel before needing an oil change or tune-up, which is likely what the therapist was suggesting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully acknowledge the absurd situation with a car in therapy while also making a pun on the common phrase "I'd like to see you again in a week." In this case, the car needs to come back in 5,000 miles, which is a long time, emphasizing how unhelpful therapy would be for a car.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's absurd to think that a car would be a patient in therapy. The therapist tries to end the session in the same way she would with a human patient, by saying she'd like to see them again, but in this case, it's not possible. The joke is clever because 5,000 miles is a common interval for getting a car's oil changed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the traditional phrase "I'd like to see you again in a week/month/year". In this case, the therapist wants to see the car again in 5,000 miles, which is the average distance a car can travel on a single tank of gas. The joke is funny because it highlights the absurdity of treating a car as a patient.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is giving the car the same advice he would give to a human patient. This is absurd because cars don't have mental health issues, and don't need to see a therapist every 5,000 miles.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "seeing you again." In a normal context, "seeing you again" would mean scheduling another appointment to talk. However, in this context, the car needs to see the therapist again in 5,000 miles, which is the amount of miles until the car's next oil change.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="103.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="105.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
