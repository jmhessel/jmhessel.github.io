"The guy you're looking for" could refer to either the ballerina dancer or the mobster. In the first case, the bartender is telling the trenchcoat-wearing man that the dancer left the bar an hour ago. In the second case, the bartender is telling the man that the mobster he is looking for waltzed out of the bar, i.e., left in a hurry.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the guy the man in the trenchcoat is looking for has left the bar, and the fact that he left is communicated with the word "waltzed." The word "waltzed" is usually associated with dance, so the fact that the guy left the bar by "waltzing" implies that he is a dancer, like the ballerina that is standing behind the man in the trenchcoat. The joke is clever because it uses the fact that the ballerina is present in the bar to give a clue as to where the guy the man is looking for has gone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the trenchcoat is looking for someone, and the bartender tells him that the person he is looking for "waltzed out of here an hour ago." The joke is funny because the word "waltzed" can mean both to dance the waltz, or to leave quickly/sneakily, and in this case, the latter meaning is implied.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the trenchcoat is looking for someone, and the bartender says they left "an hour ago." However, the word "waltz" can also mean to leave quickly or without notice, which is probably what the man in the trenchcoat is really looking for. The ballerina dancer behind him reinforces this meaning, as she is wearing a tutu, which is associated with the Waltz.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man the bartender is talking about left the bar "an hour ago," but he left dancing, or "waltzed." The fact that he left dancing implies that he left quickly and gracefully, which is the opposite of what one would expect from a gangster-type character.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the trenchcoat is looking for someone, and the bartender says that the guy he's looking for "waltzed out of here an hour ago." The fact that the man he's looking for is a dancer makes this even funnier, because it's an unexpected way for him to have left.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the phrase "waltzed out of here" is usually used to describe someone leaving politely or under their own power. In contrast, the man being sought by the mobster is a dancer, so he literally waltzed out. The joke also plays on the contrast between the violent world of mobsters and the often refinement associated with ballet dancers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the trenchcoat is looking for someone, but the person he's looking for has already left. The man is looking for someone who has "waltzed out of here," which is a reference to the Waltz, a type of dance. The fact that the man is looking for someone who has "waltzed out of here" is funny because it's an unusual way to describe someone leaving a bar.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a "waltz" is a type of dance, and the guy the man in the trenchcoat is looking for has left the bar. The fact that the guy left by "waltzing out" is a play on words, because a waltz is a type of dance. Also, the fact that the guy the man is looking for is a "ballerina" is another play on words, because ballerinas often dance the waltz.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man the bartender is talking about left the bar an hour ago, but he did so by "waltzing" out, meaning he left in a hurry or in a hurry to escape. This contrasts with the much more graceful and slow movements associated with ballet dancing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the trenchcoat is looking for someone, and the bartender tells him that the person he's looking for left an hour ago. The word "waltzed" is usually used to describe a slow, elegant dance, like a waltz, which is the opposite of what the man in the trenchcoat is probably looking for. The man in the trenchcoat is probably looking for someone who is in a hurry, and the use of the word "waltz" implies that the person he's looking for is not.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the trenchcoat is probably looking for someone, given his attire. The bartender says that the guy he's looking for left an hour ago, but he didn't just leave, he left "waltzing," which is a type of dance. This is funny because it means that the guy he's looking for is a ballerina, which explains why the dancer behind him was looking so upset.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the trenchcoat is looking for someone, and the bartender tells him that the person he's looking for left "an hour ago." The term "waltzed out" is often used to describe someone leaving quickly and peacefully. In this case, it's implied that the person the man is looking for left quickly, and the man in the trenchcoat missed them. The joke is also a play on words because the word "waltzed" can describe both a type of dance and a type of leaving.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the traditional dance of a gangster is not a waltz, it's usually more associated with hard-hitting music like jazz or rock. In contrast, the ballerina behind the mobster is doing a dance that is much more gentle and eloquent. The joke implies that the mobster is looking for someone, but they left the bar peacefully, unlike the typical portrayal of gangsters in media.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words.

The word "waltzed" is usually used in the context of dancing, so the fact that it is being used to describe someone leaving implies that the person left in a hurry. The fact that the person left in a hurry is also implied by the fact that they are a ballerina, which is a profession that requires a lot of grace and precision.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="103.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="105.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
