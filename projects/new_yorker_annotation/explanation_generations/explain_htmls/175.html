Licking is something that dogs do, but it's also a term for kissing. So, the dog is asking if there's anything else the other dog would like him to do for them, since he can't scratch them with his cone on.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cone is supposed to stop the dog from licking, but because it's on backwards, the dog can still lick. The dog is offering to lick the other dog in a reversal of the intended usage of the cone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The dog with the ineffective Elizabethan collar is offering to lick the other dog anywhere it wants, but the word "lick" can also be a verb meaning to hit or to beat. Therefore, the dog is also offering to fight the other dog.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common trope of dogs being attracted to each other's butts. In this case, the dog with the cone on backwards is offering to lick the other dog's butt, but the cone prevents the other dog from understanding what is being said. The fact that the dog with the cone on backwards is still trying to flirt despite the obstacle is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Elizabethan collar is meant to stop the dog from licking its own wound. But because the cone is on backwards, the dog can still lick its own wound. The dog is asking the other dog if there's anywhere it would like to be licked.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog on the left, who is not wearing the cone backwards, is offering to lick the other dog's cone. This is humorous because the cone is meant to stop the dog from licking their own wounds, so the other dog's cone would be effectively useless.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "any place you'd like me to lick for you" could be a sexual innuendo, with the word "lick" being a slang term for performing oral sex. However, in this case, the dog is simply offering to lick the other dog's wounds, as is often done with Elizabethan collars. The fact that the dog is offering to perform a helpful act but using sexual language is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the fact that dogs often lick their own genitals and also because the dogs are wearing cones which make it difficult for them to lick anything. The dog with the cone on backwards is especially comical because it suggests that the dog is either very confused or very naughty.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The dog with the cone that's facing the wrong way is saying that he's willing to lick the other dog in a sexual way. However, because he's wearing a cone, he can't actually do it. The joke is clever because it's both a dirty joke and a pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The Elizabethan collar is a type of cone that is put on dogs to prevent them from licking their wounds. However, because the cone is on backwards, the dog is essentially offering to lick the other dog's wounds. The joke is further compounded by the fact that licking is often seen as a sign of affection between dogs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it takes advantage of the fact that, when animals have their head constrained by an object like a cone, they can't balance themselves properly and often appear to be offering sexual favors to whomever put the object on them. In this case, the dog with the cone on backwards is especially comical because it's cone is useless, making the dog appear to be especially eager to lick something.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Elizabethan collar, or "cone of shame" is typically used to prevent dogs from licking their own wounds. However, in this case, the dog has the cone on backwards, and is offering to lick the other dog's wound instead. This is an ironic reversal of the typical use of the cone, and thus is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Elizabethan collar is typically put on dogs to stop them from licking their wounds, and thus the cone is placed in a way that the dog can't reach its own body. However, the dog on the left side is wearing the cone backwards, so the dog on the right side is essentially offering to lick the other dog's wounds for them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog with the ineffective Elizabethan collar is saying that it will lick any body part the other dog wants in order to make up for the fact that it can't dogs because its collar is turned the wrong way. In other words, the dog is offering a sexual favor in exchange for being allowed to scratch the other dog.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the phrase "any place you'd like me to," meaning that the speaker is willing to do anything the other person asks. In this case, the speaker is a dog, and the place they are offering to lick is the other dog's privates, an intentionally humorous and disgusting offer.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="174.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="176.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
