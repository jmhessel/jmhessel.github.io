He's also a member, for crying out loud!</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is talking about how a friend of hers joined a shady organization, and she's trying to validate it by saying that the friend is a member. The fact that the other person in the room is covered in hair makes it appear as if the friend is an animal, which makes the organization seem even shadier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is talking about how she saw an advertisement on TV for a club that her husband could join, and it sounded reputable. The clubs that her husband usually joins, however, are not reputable, and are likely to be things like the 'hair club for men' which is a club for balding men to get hairpieces. The fact that he is a member of such a club is not a good sign, and thus the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the husband's head and hands being covered in grass makes it appear as though he is a member of the lawn. The lawn is a club for people who like to garden, and the fact that the husband is a member of the lawn makes it sound like the old woman is trying to justify why she watches a lot of television.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the husband's head and hands being covered in grass or hair makes it appear as if he is a member of a golf course or country club. The implication is that the old woman mistook the TV show for a different kind of program that would be found on a more reputable channel. The joke is also funny because it playfully pokes fun at old people for not understanding how modern technology works.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people are watching a commercial for a dating website for people who want to date hairy people. The grandma is shocked that such a website exists, and the hairy person is shocked that the grandma would think that it's reputable. The joke is poking fun at the niche nature of the dating website, and how it might be seen as strange or odd by people who don't understand the appeal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the word "member." In this case, the woman is saying that she thought the TV show was reputable because the person who is on it is a member of a club. However, the other meaning of "member" is a part of the body, specifically the penis. So, the woman is inadvertently saying that she thought the TV show was reputable because the person who is on it has a big penis.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is talking about how she heard about a man who she thought was reputable, but it turned out that he was a member of a group that she disapproves of. The fact that the man is covered in hair or grass suggests that he is a member of a group that is into bestiality, which is an unexpected and taboo topic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the word "reputable." The person with the hairy face is watching a "reptilian" TV show, which has low production values and is not reputable, but is also a member of the Reptilian TV show fan club. The joke is that the person with the hairy face is so gullible that they believe the Reptilian TV show is good because they are a member of the fan club.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person with all the hair is probably watching a infomercial for some kind of mail-order club or product, which the older woman then mistakenly took to be a reputable organization because the person on TV said they were a member. The older woman then signed up for the club without realizing that it was a scam.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "member": in the context of the joke, the woman is talking about how the TV character is a member of a club, which makes him sound more reputable. However, the fact that the man's head and hands are covered in grass or hair implies that the woman is actually talking about how the TV character is a member of the local country club, which is funny because it's an old, stuffy club that her husband probably doesn't want to be a member of.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the old woman is apparently trying to defend her husband's decision to join a strange club by saying that it's reputable because the President is a member. The fact that the President is a member is not actually a good indicator of the club's quality, and in this case, the President is her husband, meaning that she's not even making a good argument.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's comment implies that the person with the hairy face is a member of a club or organization that watches television all day. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the woman says the organization is "reputable," which is a homonym for "riparian," meaning "relating to or situated on the bank of a river." Thus, the joke is that the person with the hairy face is a member of a club that sits on the bank (of a river) all day and watches television.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because people often join clubs or organizations to meet people and socialize. In this case, the woman's husband has joined a club --- the local lawn (or hairy man) club. The fact that he is a member makes it even funnier, because it implies that he goes to meetings, perhaps even wearing a grassy suit.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is talking about how she saw an ad on TV for a dating website, and she thought it sounded reputable because one of the members is her husband. This is ironic because, if her husband is a member of the dating website, that means he is looking for dates outside of their marriage, which is not reputable at all.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the old woman is talking about how her husband's head and hands are covered in grass or hair, as if it's a good thing. She's trying to make it sound like it's a positive thing by saying that he's a member of something (presumably a club or organization), but the reality is that it's just a weird thing that her husband has going on.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
