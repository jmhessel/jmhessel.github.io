This is silly because, while knights were often associated with rescuing damsels in distress, they would not have been associated with rescuing food.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in knight armor is interrupting the man cooking's dinner to presumably save it, but the man in the kitchen is doing a poor job of cooking, so it's unclear why the knight would need to intervene. This is a play on the common trope of the knight in shining armor rescuing the damsel in distress.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the knight is in the wrong place and his comment demonstrates that he doesn't understand what's going on. He thinks he's rescuing dinner, but in reality, he's just in the way and making a mess.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in armor is interrupting the other man while he is cooking, and he says that he heard that dinner needed rescuing. This is a play on words because, in a normal context, one might hear that someone is in danger and needs rescuing, but in this context, the man is referring to the food that is in danger of being overcooked.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Rescuing" can mean coming to save something, like a person in distress. But, it can also mean taking something out of danger, like food from a burning building. In this case, the knight is taking the food that the man is preparing (i.e., rescuing it) and eating it himself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the knight is interrupting the man cooking dinner to tell him that "dinner needed rescuing". It's humorous because, of course, dinner does not need rescuing --- unless, of course, the knight is referring to the situation in the kitchen, which is a total mess. The double meaning of the word "rescue" is what makes this joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in knight armor is interrupting the man cooking dinner by coming into the kitchen. This is unexpected because usually, knights are not associated with kitchens, and the context of the knight rescuing dinner makes it seem as if the man cooking was in some sort of danger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in knight armor is interrupting the man while he is cooking dinner, and the knight says he is there to rescue dinner. This is humorous because, while knights are supposed to rescue damsels in distress, they don't typically rescue food.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the kitchen is making such a mess that it looks like he is in need of rescuing. The knight, upon hearing that dinner needed rescuing, thought that meant there was an actual person in danger. However, the man in the kitchen is just making a mess and doesn't need rescuing, although he may need help cleaning up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the knight is in a kitchen, which is not where knights normally are. The knight is also wearing a full suit of armor, which is not appropriate for the kitchen. The joke is that the knight is trying to be helpful, but is actually causing more harm than good.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the knight is in the wrong place and time. He thinks he's supposed to be rescuing the meal, but in reality, he's just in the way and making a mess.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the person in knight armor is clearly not a actual knight, they are acting in a chivalrous manner by coming to the aid of the person in the kitchen who is cooking. This is a play on the fact that, usually, it is women who are associated with cooking and being in the kitchen, while knights are associated with being protectors.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in knight armor is interrupting the man cooking to say that he heard that dinner needed rescuing. This is absurd because the man is cooking dinner, so it does not need rescuing, and also because knight armor is not something that someone would wear while cooking.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the kitchen is making a mess, and the knight is offering to rescue him, i.e., save him. But, the man is also cooking dinner, so the knight is also literallly rescuing dinner.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in knight armor is interrupting the man while he's cooking to say that he's heard that dinner needed rescuing. This is silly because, while dinner may need rescuing in the metaphorical sense, it doesn't need rescuing in the literal sense, and the person in knight armor is clearly ready and willing to rescue it in the literal sense.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="201.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="203.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
