We will report that this planet's inhabitants are friendly and playful.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that, when people first land on a planet and meet the inhabitants, they are usually deemed "friendly" or "hostile." In this case, the aliens have landed on Earth and met a dog, who is friendly and playful. The aliens are reporting back to their home planet that the inhabitants of this planet (humans) are friendly and playful based on their interactions with the one dog.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the aliens are observing the dog as if it is an alien on a foreign planet. They are making assumptions about the dog based on its behavior, and they are concluding that the dog is friendly and playful. However, they are not taking into account that the dog is most likely a pet on the ship, and it is behaving normally for a pet.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the suburban dog is an unlikely find on an alien planet. The dog's presence indicates that the planet is earth, despite the humans' baldness and blank faces suggesting they are aliens. The joke suggests that the aliens' mission was to find earth, and they are reporting back that the planet's inhabitants are friendly and playful. The joke is clever because it uses the suburban dog as a stand-in for humanity, which is a common trope.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the aliens have misinterpreted the dog's actions. They think that because the dog is wagging its tail, it must be friendly, when in reality, dogs wag their tails for a variety of reasons including when they are happy, when they are scared, and when they are about to attack. The aliens' misunderstanding of the dog's body language is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it assumes that the aliens' mission was to observe the dog, and they are now reporting back that the planet's inhabitants are friendly and playful based on their observations of the dog. This is a silly assumption because it's not clear what connection the dog has to the planet's inhabitants as a whole.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is a typical suburban pet, which contrast with the extraterrestrial bald humans. The joke is also funny because of the play on words: the word "inhabitants" can refer to both the people and animals on a planet. In this case, the "inhabitants" are the dog, which the extraterrestrial bald humans have deemed as "friendly and playful."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The dog is on a "mission" in the sense that he is the only living creature on the spacecraft, and the aliens are observing him to see if he is friendly. However, the dog is also accomplishing the mission of the spacecraft, which is to determine if the planet's inhabitants (in this case, the dog) are friendly. The aliens conclude that the dog is friendly based on his playfulness, and thus the mission is a success.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is the only earthling on the spacecraft, and so the aliens must be observing him to study human behavior. However, since the dog is just behaving like a dog, the aliens are likely to misinterpret his actions as signifying that all humans are friendly and playful. This would give a false impression of humans to the aliens.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reversal of what would usually happen in this situation. In most movies or tv shows, if aliens landed on Earth and found a dog, the aliens would be scared or confused by the dog. But in this joke, the aliens have already completed their mission and are reporting back to their home planet that the inhabitants of this planet (Earth) are friendly and playful, based on their interactions with the dog. The joke is funny because it's a reversal of the expected reaction.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is an unlikely ambassador for Earth. The three extraterrestrial beings are observing the dog and have made the conclusion that all Earthlings must be friendly and playful based on that one interaction. This is silly because, as anyone who has ever owned a dog knows, they can be friendly and playful, but also sometimes aggressive and territorial. So, the extraterrestrials have made a false assumption about Earthlings based on their limited interaction.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is the only inhabitant on the planet, and it's not clear how the dog could be considered friendly and playful. The dog is just sitting there, not doing anything. This joke is poking fun at the idea that aliens might come to Earth and make incorrect assumptions about humanity based on observing only one aspect of our lives.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "mission accomplished" is often used to denote the successful completion of a task, in this case, the task of determining whether the planet's inhabitants are friendly. However, the joke suggests that the only thing the aliens have determined is that the dog is friendly and playful. This is amusing because it is a very low bar to clear and doesn't say much about the planet as a whole.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the aliens have mistaken the dog for one of the Earth's inhabitants. They are observing him and will report back that the people of Earth are friendly and playful. However, the dog is actually just a pet, not a representative of the human race. The aliens' misunderstanding creates a humorous situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The dog is "friendly" because it is wagging its tail, and the humans are "playful" because they are playing with the dog. However, in this context, the word "friendly" also means that the dog is not a threat, and the word "playful" also means that the humans are not a threat. Thus, the joke is implying that the dog is safe to approach and the humans are safe to approach.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the popular idiom "mission accomplished". In this case, the mission is to assess the inhabitants of a planet, and the aliens have determined that the one dog they've found is representative of all the creatures on Earth. The dog being friendly and playful is in contrast to the popular idea of aliens as being hostile and dangerous.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="137.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="139.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
