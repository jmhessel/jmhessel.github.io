Harold always takes things so literally.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the old ladies are clearly not surprised by the man sitting on the egg, whereas the man looks surprised. The joke is clever because it puns on the phrase "put all your eggs in one basket," which is a common saying about investing. In this case, the old ladies have "put all their eggs in one basket" by literally putting all their eggs in one basket (i.e., the man sitting on the egg).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the old ladies are surprised by the man sitting on the egg, they are not surprised that he is sitting on an egg. This implies that sitting on eggs is a common occurrence, even though it is not. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words --- the man is sitting on an egg, but he is also sitting on an "egg" (i.e., a nest egg), which is a savings account or investment that people use for retirement.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has seemingly laid an egg, something that only chickens can do. However, the old ladies seem nonplussed by this, suggesting that this is not an unusual event. It's possible that the man is a chicken, which would explain why he's able to lay eggs, but that would be weird because chickens are usually associated with farms, not living rooms. Alternatively, the man may have been given an egg by a chicken as part of their retirement, which would be a literal interpretation of the old ladies' comment.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="137.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="139.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
