They were widely known for their work with tigers, so the joke is referencing that when the speaker says that "auditing" them (checking their financial records) has not been easy. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the speaker is saying that auditing the magicians (checking their financial records) is like taming a tiger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the tiger in the office is a reference to the two magicians, Siegfried & Roy, who were famously attacked by a tiger during a performance. In this joke, instead of being a magical act, the tiger in the office is part of the accounting department, which provides a humorous contrast to the more glamorous image of Siegfried & Roy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men in suits are referencing Siegfried and Roy, a duo of magicians who were infamously attacked by a tiger during a performance. The fact that their coworker is attempting to fight a tiger in order to access the filing cabinet is analogous to the danger and foolishness of their line of work.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Siegfried and Roy are a famous duo who performed shows with tigers. The fact that their audits have not been easy suggests that tigers in general are difficult to work with, which is likely why the man in the tattered clothing is having so much trouble with the tiger in the office.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the tigers in Siegfried and Roy's Las Vegas act were trained to be tame and not attack the performers or audience members. However, the tiger in this office is clearly not trained and is very dangerous --- thus, the joke is that it's been difficult to audit (or keep track of) the paperwork because the workers are constantly being interrupted by the tiger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men in the office are trying to do their job, auditing, which is financial oversight, but they are having a lot of trouble because of the tiger. The tiger is a reference to Siegfried and Roy, the magicians who were famously attacked by a tiger during a show. In the context of the joke, the tiger is preventing the office workers from doing their job, just as the tiger in Siegfried and Roy's act prevented them from finishing their show.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Siegfried and Roy are magicians who used to have a tiger act in their shows. The joke implies that the man in the office is trying to audit Siegfried and Roy, who are probably long gone, and that the task has been made harder by the presence of the tiger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in order to audit or review the financial records of Siegfried & Roy, the speakers would need to be in the presence of the tigers, which is dangerous. The fact that they are also in an office, which is typically a safe place, makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Siegfried and Roy are a real-life Las Vegas act where they perform with tigers. They are known for being very safety-conscious, to the point where their tigers are well-trained and no one has ever been seriously hurt during their performances. In this case, the joke is that the auditors are having a difficult time because the tigers are so well-trained that they are hard to find any mistakes in the act.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The two men in suits are auditors, which means they audit the financial records of companies. Siegfried and Roy are famous magicians who used to have a show in Las Vegas with tigers. The joke is that the auditors are having a difficult time because the tigers are guarding the filing cabinets, which presumably contain the financial records that the auditors need to access.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the image is reminiscent of the Las Vegas show Siegfried and Roy, in which two magicians perform tricks with tigers. The man in the office is trying to Audit, or inspect, the file cabinet, but the tiger is making it difficult. The joke is also a play on words, because "auditing" can also mean to inspect financially.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of a tiger in an office environment: the joke suggests that the presence of the tiger is due to the fact that the company's auditors are Siegfried and Roy, world-famous tiger tamers. However, the joke could also be interpreted to mean that the tiger is part of an accounting firm which is auditing the company, which would also be an unusual scenario.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to the magicians Siegfried and Roy, who famously used tigers in their stage shows. The magicians were sued for animal cruelty, which has led to audits of their practices. The joke is implying that the man in the office is having a difficult time because he is being audit in a similar way, except with a real tiger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it refers to the fact that Siegfried and Roy, world-famous magicians, were sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for securities fraud. The joke suggests that the environment in the office, with a tiger guarding the file cabinet, is just as dangerous as trying to audit the notoriously tricky magicians.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Siegfried and Roy are a duo of magicians who used to perform with tigers. The joke is implying that the man in the office is trying to tame the tiger, in the same way that Siegfried and Roy tamed their tigers for their shows. The fact that it's an office environment makes it even funnier, because it's such a mundane place for something like this to be happening.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
