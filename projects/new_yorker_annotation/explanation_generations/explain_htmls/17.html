Can't miss it. Please hurry.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The person who is supposed to be vacuumed up is giving directions to the person holding the vacuum cleaner as if they are going to the White House. However, since they are being vacuumed up, the person giving the directions is actually going to be the one going to the White House.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person giving directions to the vacuum ship is giving them for the White House, the home of the President of the United States. This joke is clever because it is a play on words; the White House is usually described as a "big white house," but in this case, it is the actual target that the vacuum is supposed to be cleaning up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the aliens are vacuum cleaners are attempting to vacuum up the President of the United States and his dog. The joke is clever because it's a play on words -- the aliens are asking for directions to the "White House", but they are also literally asking for the president's house so they can vacuum him up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who is supposedly being vacuumed up by the UFO is giving directions to the driver as if this is a normal occurrence. The joke is clever because it is a play on words; when people are being sucked into a vacuum, they are said to be "vacuumed up."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the people being vacuumed up by the aliens are being abducted to the White House, presumably to meet with the President. This is a play on the trope of people being abducted by aliens, but with a political twist.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The person giving directions to the vacuum cleaner is assuming that it is intelligent enough to understand english and follow street directions. They are also assuming that the vacuum cleaner is friendly and wants to help, when in reality, it is probably planning to vacuum up the person and the dog.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The person is giving directions to the vacuum cleaner as if it's a person or entity that can understand them. However, the vacuum cleaner doesn't need directions because it's a machine that sucks up dirt and debris --- it doesn't have a destination.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the address of the White House (1600 Pennsylvania Avenue); in this situation, the people are asking the vacuum cleaner to take their dog to the White House. The absurdity of the request makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The speaker is telling the person operating the vacuum cleaner how to get to the White House, but they could also be telling the person how to get to Heaven. The joke is clever because it's a double meaning that is both funny and clever.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common instruction given by taxi drivers to their passengers. In this case, the people being vacuumed up by the aliens are essentially in a taxi, being taken to an unknown destination. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the common anxiety people have about being abducted by aliens.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a very normal thing to say when giving directions to someone, but in this context, it's absurd because the person is giving directions to aliens who are flying a vacuum cleaner. The joke is funny because it's a play on words --- the person is giving the aliens literal directions to the White House, but they are also telling the aliens to hurry because they are literally sucking up the people on the sidewalk.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person giving directions to the vacuum cleaner is assuming that it is intelligent enough to understand human language and navigate using verbal directions. They also seem to be under the impression that the vacuum cleaner is going to the White House to clean it, which is a comical image.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the famous line "E.T. phone home." In this joke, instead of asking the aliens to call him, the person on the ground is giving directions to the aliens on where to find the President's house. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the trope of aliens being interested in human political leaders like the President.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who is being vacuumed up is giving very specific instructions on where to find their house, as if this is a normal occurrence that the aliens are used to. This joke plays on the idea that people who are in peril often have a heightened sense of awareness and are able to think more clearly than usual.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on vacuum cleaners being known for their powerful suction. In this case, the vacuum is so powerful that it's sucking up people and animals off the ground. The person piloting the vacuum is asking for directions to the White House, which is a symbol of the American government. The joke is funny because it's a play on how the American government is often accused of "sucking up" its citizens.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
