This is a play on the common belief that taxes are a necessary evil that everyone has to pay.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Grim Reaper is known for taking people's lives, but in this case, he is the one who has died.

So, the fact that the speaker is hoping for taxes to die first is ironic and funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Grim Reaper is a figure that is representative of death, and taxes are something that people often complain about because they are unhappy with how much money they have to pay. The Grim Reaper is joking that he was hoping taxes would die before he did.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the saying "to bury the hatchet", which means to end a feud. In this case, the Grim Reaper, who is a personification of death, is literally burying the hatchet by hiding in a coffin at a funeral. This is a clever way of saying that the speaker would like death to end the feud.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is unexpected. The Grim Reaper, who is responsible for taking people's lives, is attending his own funeral. The speaker is joking that they hoped taxes would go away before the Reaper did.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Grim Reaper is attending his own funeral, and he is surprised that he died before taxes.

The person making the joke is hoping that taxes, something that everyone hates, would die before the grim reaper. This is a play on the idea that death is something that is inevitable and everyone must face eventually.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is impossible: the Grim Reaper, personification of death, cannot die. He's in a casket at a funeral, which is for people who have died, but he is not dead. The Grim Reaper must be very annoyed with the situation, expecting tax reform to happen before his own death.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Grim Reaper isDeath, personified. He is not supposed to die, but he is in a casket at a funeral. The other people at the funeral are surprised that he is there. The joke is clever because it play on the fact that people often say they hope taxes die before they do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Grim Reaper is known as a bringer of death, but in this case, he is the one who has died.

This joke pokes fun at the inevitability of death.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it reverses the roles of the Grim Reaper and taxpayer; in this joke, the Grim Reaper is the one who died and is in the casket, while the taxpayer is standing outside the funeral hoping that taxes, a common source of dread and anxiety, would go before the Grim Reaper. The Grim Reaper is usually associated with death, so the idea of the Grim Reaper dying is unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that death is often seen as an inevitability, and that most people would prefer to die of natural causes rather than be killed by the Grim Reaper. In this case, the Grim Reaper has died, and the speaker is joking that he was hoping that taxes, another inevitability, would have killed him first.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common phrase "death and taxes." The Grim Reaper is known for taking people's lives, but in this case, he himself has died. The couple at the funeral is paying their respects to the Grim Reaper, but the joke is that they are more relieved than sad because now taxes might have a chance of going away.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Grim Reaper, who is responsible for taking people's lives, is now himself dead. The fact that he is in a coffin at a funeral implies that even he is subject to death. The joke arises from the fact that death is usually seen as something that is permanent and never-ending, but in this case, it has ended for the Grim Reaper.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="16.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="18.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
