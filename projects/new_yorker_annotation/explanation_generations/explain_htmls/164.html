This is humorous because it's a ridiculous punishment that does not fit the crime.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the stocks is restrained and unable to move, which would normally prevent him from being able to check his phone during a meeting. However, in this case, the speaker is using the word "restrained" to mean the opposite of what it normally means, i.e., the man is so tightly bound that he will be unable to check his phone. The joke relies on the ambiguity of the word "restrained" to be funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the stocks is being punished for checking his phone during a meeting, which is a modern day offense. However, the method of punishment is very old-fashioned, which makes the joke ironic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the punished man is being restrained in an anachronistic way. It's as if thePunisher from a different time period has been transported to the present day, where he is now being laughed at for his old-fashioned methods. The joke is also funny because it's a clever way to punish someone who is addicted to their phone, by making it impossible for them to use it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in stocks is being punished for using his phone during a meeting, and the person walking in with the woman remarks that he won't be able to use his phone in the meeting now. This is funny because it's a silly overreaction to a minor infraction.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "check" can refer to a phone, or to a type of physical restraint. In this case, the man in the stocks has been restrained so that he can't check his phone during a meeting, which is a common pet peeve in offices. The joke is clever because it is a double meaning that not everyone will catch.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the stocks is being punished for checking his phone during a meeting. This is a common punishment for slaves or young children, rather than for office workers. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the phrase "let's see him" can mean either "I hope he will" or "I hope to see him", depending on the context. In this case, the speaker is saying that they hope to see the man in the stocks (i.e., be able to check his phone during a meeting), even though that is the opposite of what they are supposed to be saying.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the stocks are usually associated with more medieval times, when people would be put in stocks as punishment for crimes. However, in this scene, the man in stocks is being punished for checking his phone during a meeting, which is a more modern "crime." The juxtaposition of the old-fashioned punishment with the more modern "crime" is amusing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man and woman watching the office worker in the stockade are probably thinking that he deserved this punishment because he was checking his phone during a meeting, which is against office etiquette. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the office worker is actually in a "stockade" for checking his phone, which is a type of punishment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "strictly business." Normally, this phrase is used to describe how someone is acting in a cordial and professional manner, adhering to social conventions. However, in this case, the man being restrained in the stocks is acting in a very non-business like way, by being restrained in the stocks, which is a very old-fashioned form of punishment. The joke is funny because it pokes fun at the hypocrisy of the phrase "strictly business."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the stocks are usually used to prevent a person from moving their arms or legs, which would make it difficult to use a phone. However, in this context, the stocks are being used to prevent the man from moving his head, which would make it difficult to check his phone during a meeting. The joke is clever because it re-contextualizes the use of the stocks in a way that is unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the stocks is being punished for a white-collar crime, which is usually something like embezzlement or fraud. These crimes are often committed by people who are in a position of power or who have a lot of money, and thus the joke is funny because it is a reversal of the typical power dynamic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the punishment doesn't fit the crime. The man in stocks is being punished as if he had committed a serious crime, even though he is only guilty of checking his phone during a meeting, which is a minor offense. The stocks are disproportionate to the offense, and thus, the joke is funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the stocks are usually associated with a more Medieval time period, and the man in the stocks is probably a white-collar worker. The joke is clever because it's using the stocks as a way to punish someone for a modern day transgression, checking his phone during a meeting, which wouldn't have been an issue back when stocks were used.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the office worker who is locked in the stockade is being punished for checking his phone during a meeting. The joke is clever because it is a play on words--- checking his "phone" (i.e. being on his phone) is what got him in the "stockade" (i.e. being punished).</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="163.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="165.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
