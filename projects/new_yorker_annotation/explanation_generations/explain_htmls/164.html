The man says he misses the "little birds", but because the birds in the yard are giant, he is actually saying that he misses the birds that used to be there, before they got so big. This is a clever way of saying that he misses the smaller, simpler birds, and possibly also the children that have grown up and gone away.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the birds in the yard are so big that they look like children.
