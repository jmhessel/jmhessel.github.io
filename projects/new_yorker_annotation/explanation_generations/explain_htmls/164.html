This is, of course, not an effective strategy to deal with a giant monster, but it's the best the man can come up with in the moment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a calm response to a situation that should induce panic. Everyone in the room is shocked because there is a giant monster terrorizing the office building, but the one man who remains calm jokes that they have the room booked until 4:00. This joke highlights the absurdity of the situation: that a giant monster would be terrorizing an office building.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "booked" can mean two things: 1) to have made a reservation or 2) to have been arrested. In this case, the man is trying to reassure the others that they don't need to worry about the giant monster outside because they have the room booked until 4:00. However, the fact that the monster is outside suggests that they might need to worry about being arrested.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who made the reservation for the room is more concerned with following protocol and sticking to the schedule than the fact that there is a giant monster outside the window. In the face of danger, the person is still focused on the task at hand, which is holding the meeting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who made the booking is trying to reassure the others that they won't be eaten by the monster outside, since they have the room booked until 4:00. This is a play on the common saying "don't worry, we're in the [insert safe place here] until [insert time]" which is meant to calm people down and assure them of their safety. However, in this case, the safety is illusory, since the room won't protect them from the monster.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "booked" can mean two things: first, that the room has been reserved or "booked" for a certain period of time, and second, that the people in the room are "booked" (i.e., scheduled) to stay there until 4:00. The fact that there is a monster outside the window trying to get in adds to the joke by making it seem like the people are trying to hold the monster off until their time is up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "booked" can mean two things: first, that the room has been reserved or "booked" in advance, and second, that the room is "booked" meaning that the people in the room are going to be eaten by the monster. The people in the room are trying to reassure each other that they have time before the monster gets them, but the double-meaning of the word "booked" makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though there is a giant monster outside the window, the person is trying to reassure everyone that they are safe because they have the room booked for a few more hours. This is a play on the common phrase "don't worry, we're in this room until 4:00" used to placate people during long/stressful meetings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In this situation, the "room" refers to both the physical space the meeting is being held in, as well as the time slot the meeting was booked for. As the meeting is being disrupted by a giant monster, the man reassuring his colleagues that they have the room booked until 4:00 is playfully suggesting that they will be able to finish the meeting despite the giant monster.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who made the reservation for the room is nonchalantly telling everyone that they don't have to worry about the Yeti, even though it's very clear that the Yeti is a threat. The joke is a play on the idea that business meetings often feel like they are going on forever, even though they are usually scheduled for a specific amount of time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in the face of an impending attack by a giant monster, the one non-panicked person in the room tries to assure everyone that they're safe... because they have the room booked for another hour. The joke cleverly satirizes the way that people in white-collar jobs often prioritize their work and schedules over everything else, even in life-and-death situations.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though there is an absolutely terrifying monster outside the window, the person is telling the others not to worry because they have the room booked until 4:00. The joke is funny because it juxtaposes the mundanity of booking a room with the utter terror of the monster situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is assuring everyone that they have nothing to worry about, even though there is a giant monster outside that is terrorizing the city. The fact that they have the room booked until 4:00pm is irrelevant to the situation, but the man is trying to downplay the seriousness of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who made the reservation for the room is more worried about the meeting running over its allotted time than the huge monster that is outside. This joke pokes fun at the stereotype of meeting-goers being more concerned with procedure than actual results.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "booked" can mean two things: first, that the room has been reserved or set aside for a specific purpose (in this case, a meeting), and second, that the room is full (of people). In this situation, the room is full of people AND it has been reserved, so the joke is that the people in the room are safe from the monster until their meeting is over.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="163.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="165.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
