The joke is clever because it is a play on words: "put it down slowly" could mean either to lower the beach ball into the pool gently, or to stop playing with the beach ball entirely. In either case, the "mothers" in the joke are the people who brought the beach ball to the pool and are responsible for it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word " mothers " in this context refers to the female of a species who gives birth and protects her young. In this case, the mother is the beach ball protecting her young (the people in the pool). However, the word "mothers" can also mean multiple women who are related to each other, usually by being mothers themselves. In this case, the joke is saying that the mothers (the women at the pool) are protective of their young (the people in the pool) and should put the beach ball down slowly so as not to scare the young.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the beach ball is so big that it looks like a mother animal (perhaps a hippo or elephant) and the people around it are its babies. The joke is punning on the fact that "ball" can refer to a number of things: a round object, the game of baseball, or testicles.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the huge beach ball filling up the pool looks like a giant mother turtle and her eggs. The people are telling the person who put the beach ball in the pool to put it down slowly because they are afraid of the "mother turtle" getting angry and attacking them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "mother" can refer to a female parent, or it can refer to a large body of water (like the ocean). In this case, the joke is saying that the mothers (i.e., female parents) are protective of their young (i.e., children), but the mothers (i.e., large bodies of water) are also protective of their young (i.e., beach balls).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "ball" can mean a lot of different things, including a sphere-shaped object such as a beach ball, or a child's toy. In this case, the word "ball" is being used to mean a baby, which is why the speaker says "the mothers are very protective of their young." The joke is clever because it is using the same word to mean two different things, and it is also using a common phrase ("put it down slowly") in a different context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people in the pool are acting as if the beach ball is a baby animal, and they are worried about the mothers of the baby animals being protective. In this case, the mother animals are the people who brought the beach ball to the pool.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Beach balls are not real animals, and therefore, there are no mothers to be protective of their young. The joke is made even funnier by the implication that the mothers in question are human mothers, who would have no need to be protective of beach balls.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. When mothers are "protective of their young," it means that they are very careful and watchful over their children to make sure they are safe. However, in this context, "young" refers to the giant beach ball, which the mothers are actually very protective of.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "put it down slowly" is usually used in regards to guns or other weapons, but in this case, it is used in reference to a beach ball. The joke is clever because it is both a play on words and a play on the fact that beach balls are often used by children at the beach.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The people around the pool are not concerned about a large beach ball in the pool, but rather a mother bear and her cub. The people around the pool are telling the person who is holding the beach ball to put it down slowly so as not to scare the mother bear, who might attacked if she thinks her cub is in danger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the pool is filled with a beach ball, which is not a creature that typically needs to be handled with care. The joke is clever because it takes the premise of the situation --- a large object in a pool --- and uses it to create a new situation, in which the beach ball is actually a mother animal and the people in the pool are its young. The joke is also funny because it pokes fun at the idea of beach balls being "motherly" in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the beach ball is so large that it could easily hurt someone if it were dropped suddenly. The fact that the mothers are protective of their young implies that the beach ball is actually a baby, which is even more absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The fact that the pool is full of a giant beach ball implies that there are many small beach balls, which the speaker is referring to as "the mothers." The joke is that the mothers are actually the giant beach balls, and the speaker is telling the person to put it down slowly because the mothers are protective of their young.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because beach balls are not alive, and therefore cannot have mothers. The mothers in this scene are the women in swimsuits, who are protectively watching over the beach ball as if it were a baby. The joke suggests that the beach ball is a child, and the women are its mothers, which is absurd.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="116.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="118.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
