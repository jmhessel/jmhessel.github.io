The boss is mad at the person who voted yes because he wants people who will disagree with him, or people who will give him an honest opinion (i.e., a "man"). But, the boss says he'll build his own "yes-man", which is a robot that will agree with everything the boss says. The joke is clever because it's a pun on the literal meaning of "yes-man" and the figurative meaning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Yes-man" is a term used to describe someone who always agrees with their boss, and in this case, the boss is saying that he would rather have a robot that always agrees with him, rather than a human who is disagreeing with him. This is ironic because the boss is surrounded by robots who are voting yes on the proposition.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "yes-man" is someone who always agrees with their boss, and the boss is saying that he doesn't need another one of those. A "yes-man" can also refer to a robot that has been programmed to always agree with its human masters --- which is exactly what Jenkins, the person voting yes, is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "If I want a yes-man, I'll build one", which is often used to describe someone who is blindly obedient or agreeing with everything said. In this case, the boss is saying that he would rather have a robot that blindly agrees with him, because at least then he could control it. The fact that the boss is already surrounded by robots who are agreeing with him makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Yes-man" is a term used to describe someone who always agrees with the boss or leader, without offering any dissenting opinions. In this case, the boss is literally saying that he could build a robot to be a yes-man, which would be more efficient than having a human in that role.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Jenkins, the person voting yes, is already effectively a yes-man to the robots, by voting with them. The boss's statement implies that he could just make a robot to do Jenkins' job if all he wants is someone who always agrees with him, which is funnier because it's true.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The boss is mad at Jenkins because he's voting yes on the proposition, just like the robots. However, the boss is saying that he could just build another robot to get another yes-vote, implying that Jenkins is replaceable. This joke is also clever because it's using a robot takeover metaphor to comment on how employers often view workers as replaceable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is mad at Jenkins for voting with the robots, and he says that if he wanted another robot that just agreed with everything, he would build one himself. This is funny because it's an exaggeration: the boss is essentially saying that he prefers actual humans, even if they don't always agree with him, over robots.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Jenkins, the human who voted yes, is being compared to a robot. This is insulting because it implies that Jenkins is a mindless follower who just does what he's told, like a robot. The boss is saying that he could literally build a robot to do Jenkins' job if he wanted someone who would always just agree with him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "yes-man." A "yes-man" is a sycophant, someone who always agrees with the boss, and in this case, the boss is saying that he would rather have a robot that he built himself, which would agree with him, than a human who is disagreeing with him. The joke is also funny because it's a dark comment on the state of the work force, and the boss's lack of faith in his own employees.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Jenkins, the person who is voting yes, is being compared to a robot. The boss is saying that he would rather have a robot that does what it's told, rather than a human who does what he's told. This is a jab at the lack of autonomy and free will that Jenkins is exhibiting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the saying "If I want your opinion, I'll give it to you." The boss is saying that he doesn't want another person who just agrees with him all the time, he would rather have a literal yes-man, or in this case, a robot that he can program to agree with him. This joke is also clever because it's a play on words: a "yes-man" is a man who always agrees, but in this case, the boss is saying he wants a "yes-man" that is, literally, a manmade machine.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is mad at the person who voted yes because he wants someone who will disagree with the robots, not just vote with them. The joke is also clever because it puns on the fact that "yes-man" can refer to either a person who always agrees or a robot, which is what the boss is hinting he will build to take the place of the current Jenkins.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in this case, the person who is voting yes is literally a yes-man, or at least he's being controlled by robots. The boss' statement is thus ironic: he's saying that he doesn't need another yes-man, but in fact, that's exactly what he's got.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a "yes-man" is a derogatory term for a person who always agrees with those in power, and the boss is accusing the man who voted yes of being a yes-man. However, the joke takes on a new layer of meaning when considering that the boss is literally talking to a robot --- in other words, the boss is saying that he would rather have a robot as a yes-man than the human employee. This speaks to the fear of robots taking over human jobs, as well as the fear of robots becoming more intelligent than humans.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="116.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="118.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
