He is pretending that the beach behind him is just a virtual background that he has set up, and that he is not really in any danger. This is contrast to the other man, who is clearly miserable and has obviously been stranded on the island for some time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is in a real-life situation that is the opposite of what people usually use Zoom backgrounds for: instead of using a nice beach background to make it look like he's on vacation, he's actually on vacation but stuck on a small island. The joke is clever because it playfully subverts the common use of Zoom backgrounds.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the man being well-fed and having a drink while being stranded on a deserted island. It's as if he's not taking the situation seriously, and is just enjoying the time off from work. The joke is also a play on the fact that many people have been forced to work from home due to the pandemic, and so they have had to create fake Zoom backgrounds to make it look like they are in their office.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="116.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="118.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
