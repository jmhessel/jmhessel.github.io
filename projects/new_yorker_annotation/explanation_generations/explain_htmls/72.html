Let me guess. Creepy is behind me.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to the Disney movie Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. In the movie, the evil queen is disguised as an old hag, and asks Snow White if she would like an apple. Snow White, not knowing that the apple is poisoned, takes a bite of it and falls asleep. In this situation, one of the dwarfs has apparently snuck up behind Snow White while she was distracted playing with the others, and the speaker is joking that the apple must be poisoned because Snow White is now asleep.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a common Rollerblading technique is called "Creepy," which is when you skate backwards with your arms outstretched. However, in the context of Snow White, the phrase "Creepy is behind me" takes on a different meaning: it's a warning that the evil queen is behind her,Ready to poison her with an apple.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is Snow White, who is being blinded by the sun. The fact that she's being blinded by the sun is a reference to the original 1937 Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, in which Snow White is forced to take a bite of a poisonous apple given to her by the Evil Queen and falls into a coma. In the original story, it is a prince who kisses Snow White and wakes her up from the coma, but in this joke, it is the dwarfs who are roller skating around her that revive her. The appearance of the dwarfs skating is a reference to the film Apache (1954), in which a group of Native Americans ride around on horses to get away from the authorities.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the reference is to the 1937 Disney movie, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. In the movie, Snow White is constantly being chased by the Evil Queen, who is disguised as an old hag. The joke is implying that the person who is roller skating behind the person telling the joke is the Evil Queen, who is creepy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to a scene in the 1937 Disney film "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" where Snow White is being chased by the evil queen; in that scene, one of the dwarfs tells Snow White to "not look back" and "let me guess" who is behind her. The joke is clever because it changes the context of the scene: instead of being chased by the evil queen, Snow White is playing with the dwarfs and they are happily skating together.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. In the original Snow White story, the evil queen was always asking her magic mirror "who is the fairest one of all?", to which the mirror would answer "you, my queen". In this case, the speaker is guessing that the person behind them is Creepy, one of the seven dwarfs, based on the fact that they areroller skating, which is something that dwarfs are known for. However, the speaker's use of the word "creepy" also references the fact that the original Snow White story is a pretty dark fairy tale, in which the evil queen tries to kill Snow White multiple times. So the joke is funny because it is both a play on words and a reference to the dark tone of the original story.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the mention of "creepy" is a reference to the Queen in the Snow White story. The Queen is often seen as a creepy and evil character, so the fact that she is behind Snow White is unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "skating" can mean both roller skating and escaping. In this case, the person who said the joke is roller skating with Snow White and the seven dwarfs, but they are also escaping from the castle, which is presumably where the evil queen lives. The joke is funny because it's a double meaning that is clever and apt given the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that in many Disney movies, the villain is lurking behind the hero/heroine, watching them. The joke is that even though the Roller skating Snow White scene is from a different fairy tale, the dwarfs are still expecting the villain, Creepy, to show up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the film "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs". In the film, there is a scene where the dwarfs are roller skating and Snow White is not. As they are skating, one of the dwarfs falls and Snow White comes to help him. The other dwarfs say "Don't tell us, let us guess. Snow White is behind us", and when they turn around, she is indeed behind them. In this scene, the tables are turned and it is Snow White who is behind the dwarfs, and she says the same thing to them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "don't look now, but," which is often used to introduce someone to a scary situation. In this case, the situation is not scary, but is instead Snow White roller skating with the seven dwarfs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to a scene in the movie "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" where Snow White is surrounded by the forest animals and they warn her that the Evil Queen is behind her. In this situation, the dwarfs are suggesting that the queen is behind Snow White, but given that they are all roller skating, it's not clear how they would know if someone was behind her or not.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to the 1937 Disney movie Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. In the movie, the evil queen disguises herself as an old woman and offers Snow White an apple. The apple is poisoned and puts Snow White into a deep sleep. In this situation, the roller skating Snow White jokes that she knows the queen is behind her, disguised as an old woman, because she can feel her presence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in most versions of the Snow White story, the Evil Queen is the one who is after Snow White, not the Prince. In this case, the Prince is behind Snow White and she jokes that he must be the Creeper, a reference to the character from the popular horror game series. The joke is funny because it unexpected and playfully pokes at the Snow White story.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the original Snow White story, the queen is the one who is behind Snow White, not Creepy. In this version, with the dwarfs, it's Creepy who is behind her, which is a reversal of the original story. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: in the original story, the queen is "creepy," but in this version, it's the actual character of Creepy who is behind Snow White.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
