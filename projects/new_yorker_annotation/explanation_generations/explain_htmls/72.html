However, in this context, the phrase takes on a more literal meaning as the city in the background is completely destroyed. The woman in the scene is probably the man's only other option for company, so he is essentially saying that he wants to break up with her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the phrase "I'd like to see other people", which is commonly used when breaking up with someone. However, the fact that the two people are sitting on a bench in the middle of a wasteland implies that they are the only people around, making the statement absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is sitting on a bench, which can be a piece of furniture, but it can also be a verb, meaning "to sit." So, the man is saying that he wants to see other people, as in, date other people, but he is also saying that he literally wants to see other people, as in, other people who are not his current partner.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man and woman in the wasteland are probably not going to find anyone else in the middle of a wasteland. Even if they did find someone, it's unlikely that person would be dressed up in fancy clothes. The joke is a play on the phrase "I'd like to see other people," which is often used to break off an exclusive relationship.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a common phrase said during a breakup, but in this case, it's said in the middle of what appears to be a post-apocalyptic wasteland. The couple is sitting on a bench in the middle of the rubble, suggesting they were just talking about their relationship when one of them said they wanted to see other people. The joke is funny because it's a contrast between the dire situation they are in and the triviality of the reason they are breaking up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "seeing other people" is often a euphemism for dating or sleeping with other people while in a relationship with someone. However, in this context, it is literally true: the speaker would like to see other people because there is nobody else around in the wasteland. The joke is a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman in the scene is saying that she wants to see other people, as in, date other people, but because of the destruction in the background, the man interpretes this want as a desire to see if there are any other survivors in the city. This misunderstanding is humorous because it's a misunderstanding about something so basic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's response to the man's declaration that he wants to see other people is very out-of-place. In a modern setting, the ruins of a city would not be the ideal place to have a conversation about seeing other people (i.e., starting an open relationship or breaking up). However, the woman's response implies that she is okay with the idea, and is willing to have the conversation here and now. This is ironic because the surrounding ruined cityscape is usually associated with the aftermath of a relationship (i.e., a "war zone"), not the start of one.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reversal of the usual break-up line, "I need some time alone." In this context, the couple is sitting on a bench in the middle of a wasteland, so the man's line takes on a new meaning: instead of wanting to date other people, he literally just wants to see if there are any other living people in this desolate place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the situation: two people who are well-dressed and sitting in the midst of a destroyed city are having a conversation as if they are in a normal, healthy relationship. The joke could be interpreted as a commentary on how even in the most dire of circumstances, people can still maintain normalcy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a normal context, "I'd like to see other people" is something you might say when breaking up with your significant other. However, in this context, the fact that they are sitting in the middle of a wasteland implies that there are no other people to see, which makes the statement humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is saying that he would like to date other people, but because of the destruction in the background, it sounds like he is saying that he would like to see other people who are still alive. This is a dark joke, as it implies that the woman he is with is the only other person still alive in the city.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman has just said that she wants to see other people, meaning she wants to break up with the man. However, the destruction in the background makes it appear as though there is no one else left in the world, suggesting that the woman's desire to see other people may not be possible.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "I'd like to see other people", which is usually said by a person who is in a relationship and wants to break up with their significant other. However, in this case, the person is saying it to their significant other while they are looking at the destruction of a city in the background. The joke is that, in a relationship, people usually break up with each other because they want to see other people, but in this case, the person wants to break up with their significant other because they want to see other people who are not in the city that was just destroyed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people are in a relationship, but they are sitting on different benches, which suggests that they are not together. The fact that they are in a destroyed city also suggests that their relationship is in a bad place, which is why the man wants to "see other people."</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="71.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="73.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
