The man in the scene is chiseling a stone wheel, which is a common object, and not something that needs to be reinvented.

The man in the scene is chiseling a stone wheel, which is something that's been around for a very long time. The phrase "reinventing the wheel" is often used to describe someone coming up with something new that's not necessary because a similar thing already exists. In this case, the man is just making a stone wheel, not reinventing it, but the joke is that he's "making it great again" --- a play on the phrase "making America great again" which was popularized by Donald Trump during his presidential campaign.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is staring at the wheel, and the women are talking about how he's not doing anything to help with the housework. However, the man is actually trying to reinvent the wheel, which is a saying for when someone trying to do something that has already been done before. In this case, the man is trying to make the wheel "great again" --- meaning, he's trying to make it better than it was before.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is not "reinventing" the wheel, because that would be impossible, he's just making it "great again." This is a spin on the common political slogan "Make America Great Again," which is often used by conservatives. The joke is clever because it's both a play on words and a political commentary.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the room is staring at the wheel, and the joke is that he's not trying to reinvent it, he's just trying to make it great again. This is a play on the phrase "make America great again," which was popularized by Donald Trump during his presidential campaign.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the room is looking at the wheel, and it's implied he's trying to make it better/reinvent it. However, the pun is that he's actually making it "great again," as in the campaign slogan of Donald Trump. This is unexpected because it's not usually a goal to make something that's already been invented "great again."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is looking at a giant donut, which could possibly be a new sculpture. The phrase "reinventing the wheel" is often used to describe someone coming up with a new idea that's not necessary because a similar idea already exists. However, in this case, the man is looking at the giant donut and thinking that it's not a new idea, but rather a great example of something that already exists.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the current US president Donald Trump's campaign slogan "Make America Great Again". The man in this scenario is not actually improving the design of the wheel, he's just making it bigger, making it more excessive and unnecessary, much like how Trump's presidency is perceived.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the scene is carving a stone wheel, which is an ancient invention. The phrase "making it great again" is a deliberate echo of the catchphrase associated with President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, "Make America Great Again." In this context, the joke is making a joke about how the Trump administration is trying to take credit for things that were created long ago, or things that have been around for a long time and are not new inventions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is clearly not happy with the donut, and is considering it with a distasteful look on his face. However, the phrase "reinventing the wheel" is often used to mean coming up with a new and improved way of doing something --- in this case, the man is not coming up with a new way of making donuts, he's just making them great again.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is not actually reinventing the donut, he is just making it bigger. The joke is a play on the phrase "making America great again", which was popularized by President Donald Trump. The joke implies that the man is as misguided as Trump, who also claims to be reinventing America.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is looking at a giant donut sculpture, which could be interpreted as a symbol of American excess. The joke implies that the man is not interested in reinventing the wheel (the donut), but rather in making it great again, a play on Donald Trump's campaign slogan.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is staring at the wheel, and the women are talking about how he is trying to reinvent it. However, the word "reinvent" can also mean to make something great again, which is what the man is actually doing. The joke is clever because it is a pun on the two meanings of the word.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is CHOOSING to look at the giant donut, which is a sculpture. The joke implies that the man is not very bright, and is making a poor life choice by staring at the donut instead of something else, like a painting or a statue.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the man is staring at the wheel, it's not clear what he's doing with it. Is he trying to figure out how to use it? Is he trying to reinvent it? The joke is that he's actually just trying to make it great again, which is a play on the current political slogan "Make America Great Again." The wheel is a symbol of progress, and by making it great again, the man is implying that he wants to go back to a simpler time.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="231.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="233.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
