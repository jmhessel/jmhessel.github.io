The joke is that the couple is suggesting that they enjoy the emoji-trees while they can, implying that they won't be around for long. This is funny because it's unlikely that the emoji-trees will actually go anywhere, and even if they do, there are plenty of other things that will be emoji-fied.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that trees are living organisms, and, like all living organisms, they eventually die. The happy faces on the trees are a metaphor for how short and fleeting life is. The couple in the park is enjoying the happy faces on the trees while they can, because they know that they won't be there forever.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker implies that the couple's relationship won't last, and compares the couple to the leaves on the trees. This is a play on the saying "love is like a rollercoaster," which means that it has its ups and downs. The joke suggests that the couple is currently in an up, but that it won't last, just like the leaves will eventually fall off the trees.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "let's just enjoy the moment." The moment here is being enjoyed by the couple, but it's also imperiled because the trees are emoji, which are commonly used on phones and computers, and thus are at risk of becoming extinct if those technologies are no longer used.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The couple is talking about how they enjoy looking at the happy trees, but the word "enjoy" can also be used as a verb meaning "to eat", as in "let's enjoy this meal". In this case, the couple is saying that they will enjoy the happy trees while they are still around, but the implication is that they will eat them. This joke is a play on the fact that trees are often used as a food source, especially in the park, where people might picnic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of the word "enjoy": the couple is clearly enjoying each other's company, but the fact that the trees are happy as well implies that they may not be around for much longer. This could be interpreted as a commentary on the fleeting nature of happiness, or the impermanence of life itself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, although the trees are happy and smiling, they may not be around for long. The couple is saying that they should enjoy the trees while they can, because they may not be there for much longer. The trees' happiness may be short-lived.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The couple is talking about how they should enjoy the happy trees while they are still around, but the trees are literally alive and happy. The joke is implying that the couple should enjoy their time together while they are still alive and happy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that trees are often used as a symbol for relationships/love. The trees in this scene are depicted as happy and smiling, which is not typical for trees. The couple is hugging and enjoying their time together, and the joke is that they should enjoy the trees while they are still happy, because they won't be smiling for long.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the couple is aware that the happy faces on the trees are not a permanent fixture, and will eventually go away. The happy faces on the trees are a temporary measure, like an emoji, and will eventually lose their meaning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The couple is enjoying their time together while they are still "in the autumn of their life", meaning that they are getting older and their time together is limited. However, the trees in the scene are also in the autumn of their life, as it is fall, and they will soon be shedding their leaves. The couple is unaware of this, and so they think that the trees will be around forever, just like them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the trees are happy, but the couple is not, implying that the couple is going to break up soon. The trees are happy because they are in the fall season, but the couple is not because the impending break-up will likely be fall-out from their relationship.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The couple is surrounded by trees with faces, which could be interpreted as meaning that the trees are emoji. Emoji are often used to represent things that are transient or ephemeral, like moods or expressions. Thus, the joke is that the couple should enjoy the trees while they're still around, because they won't be there for long.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the trees are alive and happy, which is unusual. The couple is talking about how they should enjoy the trees while they're still around, implying that the trees will eventually die. This is a dark joke because it's playing off the common understanding that trees can live for a long time, but eventually, they will die.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is walking in the park and enjoying the autumn leaves, but the trees are alive and happy, which is strange. Furthermore, the trees are smiling, which is even stranger. The joke is clever because it uses the trees' facial expressions to suggest that they won't be around for much longer, hinting at the transience of life.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="231.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="233.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
