The other superheros in the bar can't see him, and he presumably can't see them either. The joke is that the invisible man is the only one who can pick up the tab, since he's the only one who can't be seen. The non-superhero man is probably the one who will have to pay the bill.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the superheros are sad because they are facing difficult challenges and problems, but the non-superhero man is relieved of his financial burden by one of the superheros. This is a play on the common trope in superhero stories where the superheros help out normal people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the non-superhero man is talking about how one of the superheros, who is invisible, picked up his tab. He is probably invisible because he is wearing a costume that makes him invisible, rather than because he has actual superpowers. The joke is funny because it's a play on words; the superhero picked up the tab (i.e., paid the bill), but because he's invisible, the non-superhero man can't see him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the fact that the invisible man is, well, invisible. And so, when he picked up the tab at the bar, the bartender couldn't see him do it. This non-superhero must have been the only one who saw what happened.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that one of the superheros is invisible. The bartender is telling the non-superhero man that he doesn't have to pay for his drinks because the invisible man has already covered the tab. This is humorous because the non-superhero man can't see the invisible man, so he can't confirm that he is actually there.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it uses the fact that one of the superheros present, the invisible man, is, well, invisible. Thus, the bartender couldn't see him when he picked up the tab, and so the non-superhero man has to pay. This is a reversal of the expected situation, where the superheros would be the ones picking up the tab for the non-superhero.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. Normally, when someone says that someone else "picked up their tab," they mean that the other person paid for their drinks. In this case, the "invisible man" didn't actually pick up the tab --- he just made himself invisible, which means the person owes the money.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it points out the absurdity of having an invisible man as a member of a group of superheros. It would be difficult for the invisible man to do anything useful, let alone fight crime. The joke is made funnier by the fact that the bartender says that the invisible man picked up the tab, implying that he was actually helpful in some way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the superheros is the "Invisible Man", meaning he has the power to turn invisible at will. The joke playfully imagines that the man used his power to turn invisible in order to avoid paying his share of the bar tab. The other superheros are sad because they have to foot the bill for the Invisible Man's drinks, and the bartender is telling the story to the non-superhero man.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the invisible man is in the bar, but he's not paying for his own drinks. The man who is paying for the invisible man's drinks is probably picking up the tab for the entire group. The joke is also funny because the idea of an invisible man drinking alcohol is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, of all of the superpowers that the heroes in the bar have, the invisible man's is probably the least useful. The joke implies that the heroes are so unhappy with their lives that even the invisible man, who can't do much to help them, is picking up their tab. This is a play on the "unhappy hour" at bars, where drinks are discounted to lure in customers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the superheros are so sad and drunk that they can't even pay their bar tab, and the invisible man, who is also at the bar, had to pick it up for them. This joke relies on the fact that the invisible man is, well, invisible, and so the other people at the bar wouldn't have seen him do this act of generosity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In this context, the "invisible man" is the non-superhero man who is not on the tab, or the list of people who have to pay for their drinks. The bartender is telling the man that he doesn't have to pay, because the invisible man already did. This is clever because it's both a reference to the superhero character who is actually invisible, and also to the fact that the man is not super and thus not known or recognized by the other people in the bar.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the irony of the situation. The invisible man is a superhero, and thus he has the power to turn invisible. However, he is using this power to commit the petty crime of not paying his bar tab. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words --- when you "pick up a tab," it means to pay for someone's bill.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the punchline is a play on words. The tab refers to the bill at the bar, which the person who is invisible has presumably picked up and run off with, meaning that the other people at the bar have to pay for the drinks. However, the phrase "the invisible man" can also refer to a man who is not there, meaning that no one is picking up the tab and the superheros are stuck with the bill.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
