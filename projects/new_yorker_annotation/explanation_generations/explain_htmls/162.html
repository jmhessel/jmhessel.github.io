The word "anonymous" can mean two things: 1) having no name or identity and 2) not having a known author. In this case, the joke is implying that the person who is locked up in the stockade must have put their name on their suggestion, which goes against the suggestion box being anonymous. This would be a serious matter because it would mean that their name would be known and they could be targeted for retribution.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the stocks is presumably there because he made a suggestion in the company's suggestion box that was not well-received. The joke implies that the company is very old-fashioned and doesn't take kindly to new ideas.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the stockade is a physical restraint preventing the office worker from moving his hands or head, making it impossible for him to write anonymously on the suggestion box. The joke cleverly pokes fun at the ironic situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "suggestion box" is a common fixture in many offices, which allows employees to submit suggestions for improvements to management anonymously. In this case, the man's co-worker is literally "locked up" in a stockade as a result of making an anonymous suggestion. The joke implies that management didn't take the suggestion well, and instead of simply disregarding it, they took punitive action against the co-worker.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The main character has obviously been caught putting something in the suggestion box that the boss didn't like, and so the boss is taking this opportunity to publicly humiliate him by putting him in the stocks. The joke is that the stocks are usually associated with a more public and old-fashioned form of punishment, like stocks in a medieval town square, which makes the modern office setting all the more absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the office worker in the stockade is there as a result of making a suggestion in the company's suggestion box. The joke is that, because the worker's suggestion was likely critical of the company or otherwise controversial, the company chose to make an example of him by locking him up in the stockade in the lobby for all to see. This would discourage other employees from making suggestions, as they would fear a similar fate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the stockade is a form of punishment that is often used for criminals, and it's strange to see it being used on an office worker in a business setting. The joke suggests that the man in the stockade might have been put there because he made a negative or critical comment in the anonymous suggestion box.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the stockade is there because he made a suggestion in the suggestion box that was not anonymous. The fact that he is being punished so publicly and severely for making a suggestion suggests that the company he works for does not value employee feedback. This is in contrast to the typical ideal of a company being built on communication and collaboration.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the obvious answer to why the man is in the stockade is that he made a complaint in the suggestion box, and his colleagues found out and are punishing him. The joke implies that the suggestion box is not actually anonymous, which is a problem for many office workers who want to make suggestions but don't want to deal with the potential backlash.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is implying that the man in the stocks is there as punishment for making a suggestion at work, which his co-workers didn't like. The fact that he is in the stocks, a very old-fashioned and public form of punishment, suggests that his co-workers really didn't like his suggestion. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the phrase "so much for that," which is often used to mean that something didn't work out or was a bad idea.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's implying that the man in the stocks is there because he made a suggestion at work that was unpopular, and so his co-workers have decided to make an example of him by putting him in the stocks. This is ironic because the suggestion box is supposed to be anonymous, yet, somehow, his co-workers have found out who made the suggestion and are punishing him anyway.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is implied that the man in the stocks is there because he complained about his job anonymously in the suggestion box. However, his co-workers have found out who he is and are punishing him in a very public way. The joke is clever because it turns the expected outcome (someone making an anonymous suggestion and it being dealt with in a private way) on its head.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the premise is that the person who made a negative suggestion in the suggestion box was caught and is being punished by being locked up in the stockade. The joke relies on the absurdity of the situation to be funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the stocks is likely there as a result of making a suggestion in the company's suggestion box. The fact that his punishment is so archaic and public implies that his suggestion was not well-received. The joke is also funny because it pokes at the idea that modern office work is not as "evolved" as it likes to think it is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man implies that the reason the office worker is in the stockade is because he made a suggestion in the suggestion box that was not well-received. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the word "suggestion" can mean either a polite suggestion (like one might write in a suggestion box) or a lewd suggestion. The implication is that the office worker made a lewd suggestion, and was punished accordingly.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="161.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="163.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
