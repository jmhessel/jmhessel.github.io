The word "worm" can mean either a type of small, segmented creature that often lives in the water (i.e., a real worm), or it can mean a small, colorful tube that is sometimes used as bait when fishing. In this context, the fish is ordering a shot of whiskey with a real worm in it, rather than the common tequila shot which has a small, colorful tube of worm in it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the giant fish is ordering a drink that is typically served with a worm in the bottom of the glass (the worm is an "eye-opener" to show that the tequila is good quality). But, since the fish is already a worm, it doesn't need the extra worm.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "the whole nine yards", which means everything. In this case, the fish just wants the worm (a small thing) and not the tequila (a much larger thing). The joke is also funny because it's unexpected --- we don't usually see fish at bars, let alone giant human-sized fish.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the fish is ordering a drink that is typically made with tequila, but is instead asking for just the worm that is traditionally used as a garnish. This could be because the fish is angry and doesn't want the alcohol, or because it is a teetotaler. Either way, it's a silly joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on a common phrase "the whole nine yards," which means "everything." In this case, the fish is only ordering a worm, holding the tequila, meaning that he doesn't want everything (the whole nine yards), just a worm.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the fish is drinking Tequila, which is traditionally considered a human drink. The fact that the fish is consuming alcohol is not what makes the joke funny, but rather, the fact that the fish is ordering the drink in a way that is traditionally considered human.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The fish is ordering a "worm," which is a common type of shot that is taken with tequila, but in this instance, the fish is just ordering the worm (i.e. the maggot) that is typically found in a bottle of tequila.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the fish is asking for a drink that is typically served with a worm in it (Tequila Sunrise), but is asking for the worm to be left out. This could be interpreted a few ways: first, that the fish is trying to act sophisticated by order a drink with a "garnish" but is too unsophisticated to know that the worm is not actually a garnish; second, that the fish is trying to save money by ordering a cheaper drink (Tequila Sunrise is typically made with cheaper tequila); or third, that the fish is trying to be healthy by avoiding the worm.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bartender is telling the fish that it has had enough to drink, and just to have the worm (a food typically given to fish) instead of more alcohol. This is humorous because the roles are reversed; usually, it's the bartender who is telling humans that they have had enough to drink, and not the other way around.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the fish is asking for a shot of tequila, and the bartender is saying that he'll just give the worm (which is usually found in a bottle of tequila). The worm is a defining characteristic of tequila, and so the joke is playing on the fact that the fish is asking for something that it probably shouldn't be able to consume.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "worm" can refer to both the actual larvae of a number of insects, as well as a slang term for a very drunk person. In this context, the worm is the latter, and the fish is ordering more alcohol even though it's already very drunk.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words; the fish is ordering a "worm" (a small, slimy creature that often lives in dirt or water) instead of a "wet" (a type of shot made with tequila and lime juice). The joke is also funny because it's anthropomorphizing the fish, making it appear as if it's a regular bar patron instead of a wild animal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "straight up," meaning with no ice, which is how the fish wants its drink. But "straight up" can also mean "not mixed with anything else," and in this case, the fish wants its drink to be straight up tequila, with no worm. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the fact that tequila is often served with a worm in the bottle.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The bartender is asking the fish if he wants his drink "neat," which means without ice, and the fish says that he wants it without the tequila, which is the liquor. He just wants the worm, which is what he would normally eat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "hold the [food item]," which is often used when ordering food to indicate that you don't want a certain ingredient. In this case, the fish is ordering a drink with a worm in it, but wants the worm removed. The joke is also funny because it's unexpected that a fish would be in a bar and be able to order drinks.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="20.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="22.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
