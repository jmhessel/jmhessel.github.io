I have a wife and two thousand kids!</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The bear is asking the fish to please spare him, as he has a family to take care of. But, in reality, the bear is asking the fish to spare him because he himself is a fish's family --- he's asking the fish not to eat him because he is a salmon, and salmon have wives and children.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the movie "The Bear," in which a bear is hunted by humans. In the movie, the bear has a mate and cubs, and at one point in the movie, the bear is shown fishing for salmon. In the joke, the bear is begging for mercy from the humans, saying that he has a family that he needs to take care of.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually when people ask for mercy, it's because they have a family to support. In this case, the salmon is asking for mercy because he has a huge family; not only does he have a wife, but he also has two thousand children. The bear, who is likely to eat the salmon, is unimpressed by this display of family size.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the word "bear" --- in this case, the word refers to the actual animal, a grizzly bear, rather than the verb meaning "to carry." The joke is that the grizzly bear is being asked to "bear" the salmon's children, which is a lot for him to take on considering he already has a wife and 2,000 children of his own.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the word "bear." In this case, the "bear" (the word) is a homonym for the animal. The animal bear is trying to eat the fish, and the fish is trying to escape. The joke is that the fish is pleading with the bear not to eat him, saying that he has a family to take care of. This is humorous because it's a reversal of the normal predator-prey relationship.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common story/joke in which a person is trying to reason with a bear, pleading for their life by saying they have a family to take care of. In this case, the salmon are the ones with the families, and they are pleading with the bear not to eat them. The reversal of roles is what makes this joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The bear is saying that he has a wife and kids, which is what a person would say, but in this case, the bear is referring to his actual wife, a female bear, and his two thousand cubs. This is a lot of kids for a human, but not unusual for a bear.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the salmon is begging the bear not to eat him. This is ironic because, in the wild, it is usually the other way around: animals beg humans not to eat them. The fact that the roles are reversed here is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is absurd to imagine a conversation between a bear and two salmon. In this joke, the salmon is begging for its life, and mentioning its large family, as if that would somehow dissuade the bear from eating it. The joke is also funny because it play on the stereotype that salmon are very good swimmers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the words "bear" and "bare". In this context, "bare" means "naked", so the joke is that the bear is begging the fish not to jump up the waterfall because he doesn't want to be seen naked. This is silly because, of course, bears are already naked.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idea that bears are attracted to salmon because they are fatty and nutritious. The joke is that the salmon is begging for its life, not because it's afraid of being eaten, but because it doesn't want to leave its family behind. The bear, in this case, is the one who is being asked to show mercy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that bears are always trying to eat salmon. In this case, the salmon are trying to plead with the bear not to eat them, as they have families that depend on them. The joke is also a play on the fact that bears are generally much larger than salmon, and could easily eat them if they wanted to.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity between the grizzly bear, a large and dangerous predator, and the two salmon, which are much smaller and relatively defenseless. The salmon are pleading for their lives, trying to appeal to the bear's empathy by mentioning their large family, in the hopes that the bear will spare them. However, the Bear is not likely to be moved by this appeal, making the situation all the funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bear is asking the salmon not to jump the waterfall, as the bear would then have to catch the salmon. The bear's plea of having a wife and kids is humorous because it's an exaggeration --- obviously bears cannot have human spouses and offspring.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bear is trying to eat the fish, but the fish is begging for its life. The bear is probably not going to be swayed by the fact that the fish has a family, because the bear has a family too. In addition, the fish is trying to use a human concept, "family," to appeal to the bear, which is also funny because it's not likely that the bear would even understand what that means.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="20.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="22.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
