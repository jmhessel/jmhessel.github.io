They are meticulously recording data and trying to make observations, but at the same time, they are completely missing the fact that the dog is just a friendly pet who is wagging its tail because it wants to be friends.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is being treated as a science experiment by the aliens. The aliens are observing the dog to see if it is a good boy, which is a silly thing to do since dogs are not known to be intelligent. However, the joke also has a second meaning, which is that the aliens are observing the dog to see if it is a good boy because they are trying to learn about human behavior. This is a play on the fact that dogs are often used in psychological experiments, since they are seen as good proxies for humans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the suburban dog is vastly different from the aliens, who are from another planet. The aliens are trying to figure out if the dog is a good boy, and the joke is that they are judging him by their own standards, which are not applicable to him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is presumably being tested for some sort of alien experiment, but the aliens don't seem to be getting any concrete results. The dog is just a regular dog, but the aliens are assuming that he must be some kind of special dog because they are unfamiliar with the species. This joke pokes fun at the scientific method and how aliens might be unfamiliar with it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The aliens are conducting tests on the dog to see if it is a good boy, and the results are still preliminary. However, all indications from the testing suggest that the dog is good boy, which is a pun because "good boy" can mean either that the dog is a well-behaved dog or that the dog is a male dog.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non-sequitur: the aliens are discussing the dog's behavior as if they are observing it for scientific purposes, but the conclusion they come to, that the dog is a "good boy", is unrelated to any scientific study of the dog. Furthermore, the dog's good behavior is probably not due to the aliens being good owners, since the dog most likely does not belong to them, making the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common saying, "preliminary results suggest that [something] is a good [thing]." In this case, the thing being evaluated is a dog, and the aliens are testing to see if he is a good boy. The fact that they are doing this suggests that they might not have a good understanding of what makes a dog a good boy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it uses the unexpected (a dog in space) to set up a play on words (preliminary vs. pare UFO). The situation is made funnier by the fact that the dog is acting friendly towards the aliens, wagging its tail, despite the fact that it is in an unfamiliar and dangerous situation. This suggests that the dog is actually a good boy, as the joke says, despite the unexpected circumstances.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the bald humans are aliens, and they are testing to see if the dog is a good boy. They are using advanced technology to do this, but the results are still preliminary. The joke is clever because, of course, all dogs are good boys.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is being treated like a scientific experiment by the aliens. They are testing to see if the dog is a good boy, and they haven't come to a conclusion yet. This is silly because dogs are generally thought of as being good, especially in contrast to other creatures like aliens.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is being treated like a laboratory experiment by the aliens. The joke suggests that the aliens are doing tests on the dog to see if he is a good boy, but they don't yet have enough information to make a judgement. This is humorous because, to humans, dogs are typically known to be good boys and girls, so it's funny that the aliens would need to test this.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that we don't know what aliens would look like, but we often assume that they would be bald. In this scene, the aliens are observing a dog, which they think might be a good boy, but they aren't sure because they don't know much about dogs. This lack of understanding is humorous because it's usually humans who are observing animals, not the other way around.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the aliens are observing the dog as if it is some sort of experiment. They are surprised that the dog is friendly, despite not belonging to them, and surmise that he must be a "good boy." The joke is also a play on the fact that, to most people, dogs are seen as good companions, despite not being humans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the aliens are observing a dog and trying to figure out if it is a good boy or not. They are using scientific methods to study the dog, but they are having trouble understanding it because they are not familiar with the concept of a "good boy."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the juxtaposition of a "good boy" with the situation of being on an alien spaceship in space: good boys are often used in contrast with bad boys, and so the phrase "he is a good boy" in this context implies that, in contrast to being a bad boy, this dog is being good by not trying to attack or hurt the aliens, despite being in an unfamiliar and strange environment.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="136.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="138.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
