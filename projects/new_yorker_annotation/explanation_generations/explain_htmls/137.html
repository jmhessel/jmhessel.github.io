The whale is beached on an island, which is a small land mass surrounded by water. The phrase "they were never going to find you" usually is said in regards to someone who is lost at sea, which is the opposite of being on an island. In this case, the whale is lost on an island, which is a place that should be easy to find. The fact that the whale is beached and can't get back into the water is also funny because it is a gentle creature stranded in an inhospitable environment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "they were never going to find you anyway" could mean that the person underneath the whale was never going to be found by anyone (i.e. they would have been dead), or it could mean that the person was trying to hide on the small island and the whale landing on top of them spoiled that plan.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a dark joke about the whale crushing the man and the tree. The man was probably lost on the island, and the whale landing on him ended up being a mercy killing because he would have eventually died anyway.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is saying that the whale probably won't be found by the search party because it's such a small island, but the fact that the whale is covering the man implies that the man wanted to be hidden, and now he's effectively hidden underneath the whale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The whale is beached on an island, which is a place that is hard to find, and the joke is that the whale would never have been found by humans because it is so small. This is a play on the idiom "you're never going to find a needle in a haystack", which means that something is impossible to find. The joke is clever because it is using the idiom in a literal way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The whale "beached" himself on the island, which is a homophone for "became". So the joke is that, even though the man and the tree were killed by the whale, they were never going to find the man anyway because he wasn't really on the island to begin with.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "they" could refer to either the rescue team that was looking for the man, or the whale's prey. In either case, the man is saying that the situation he is in is hopeless.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "they were never going to find you anyway" is typically used to make someone feel better about getting lost. In this case, the phrase is used to make the whale feel better about getting stranded on a small island. The fact that the island is too small for the whale is the punchline.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the whale is beached on an island that is too small, which suggests that it won't be found by anyone looking for it. This is ironic because, typically, when a whale is beached, it is because it was looking for an island to rest on and got stranded. In this case, the whale didn't need to look for an island because it was already on one, albeit a very small one.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because even though the person has been squished by the whale, the speaker implies that the person wasn't going to be found anyway. This is because the island is so small and in the middle of the ocean that it's unlikely anyone would have found the person even if the whale hadn't landed on them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the whale is beached on a small island. The whale would be hard to find even if it wasn't beached because it's a big animal and the island is small. The joke implies that the whale beached itself on purpose because it didn't want to be found, suggesting that the whale is tired of being hunted.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "they" in the sentence can refer to either the people looking for the stranded person, or the sperm whales. In the first case, the sentence would mean that the searchers were never going to find the person because they were looking in the wrong place. However, in the second case, the sentence would mean that the sperm whales were never going to find the person because they are too large and would cover the entire island.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people on the island were probably lost at sea, and the fact that a giant whale is now blocking their only way off the island isn't going to help their situation. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the idiom "you're not going to find a needle in a haystack", which is used to describe situations where something is very difficult to find. In this case, the needle is the lost person, and the haystack is the whale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the whale is beached on a tiny island, and it's clear that it won't be able to get back into the water on its own. The whale is probably going to die, and the speaker is saying that, even if it hadn't beached itself, the chances of it being found by others were slim. This is a dark joke because it's implying that the whale's death is inevitable, and it's only a matter of time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The stranded whale is saying that, even if he hadn't beached himself on the island, the two people (whose feet are poking out from under him) would never have been found by rescuers, since the island is so small and hard to spot. In other words, the whale is saying that their death was inevitable, and him beaching himself just hastened the inevitable.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
