The term "cave in" can refer to a roof collapse, but it can also refer to an artist's signature. In this case, the joke is implying that the caveman artist has a lot of talent, as he not only did the cave paintings in Lascaux, but he also did the summer cave paintings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the scene being described is impossible: lizards cannot draw, and therefore the caveman's comment that the lizard did his summer cave is absurd. The joke is a play on the fact that many famous caves with prehistoric paintings (such as Lascaux in France) are often imitated or reproduced in tourist traps.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man implies that the lizard is a famous artist who did a previous cave painting in Lascaux, France. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words --- the word "cave" can refer to both the physical space where the lizard is currently drawing, as well as the act of drawing on the cave wall (i.e., "caving").</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the reptile is doing something that it couldn't possibly do, and the cavemen are angry about it. This is a play on the word "hieroglyph," which is a type of ancient Egyptian writing that uses pictures instead of words. So, the reptile is doing a "picture" of the cave, which is something that only a human could do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Lascaux cave paintings, located in France, are some of the oldest and most famous cave paintings in the world. They are also famous for their horse depictions. The joke is that the dinosaur in the cave is not only intelligent enough to do cave paintings, but he is also a famous artist who has done work in other famous caves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of thedouble meaning of "cave": a cave can refer to a prehistoric cave dwellings where humans used to live, as well as an actual physical cave. In this case, the dinosaurs is drawing pictures in a physical cave, but the cavemen comment on how he also did their summer cave, which is a prehistoric dwelling.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is implying that the dinosaur is a professional cave painter. This is funny because it would be impossible for a dinosaur to be a professional cave painter, since they went extinct millions of years before humans even existed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it suggests that the dinosaur is a well-known and respected artist, despite the fact that he is not a caveman and is not supposed to be able to do cave drawings. The joke makes the impossible seem plausible by situating the dinosaur in a specific setting (a cave) where he would be able to do the drawings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it presupposes that the caveman is familiar with the Lascaux cave paintings, which are famous examples of prehistoric cave art. The caveman is joking that the dinosaur also did his cave, which is a much more modest and unknown cave. The joke is a play on the idea that someone might not be as famous or qualified as they claim to be.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is talking about the reptile like he is a famous artist. The caveman is upset because the reptile ruined his cave paintings, but he is also impressed because the reptile did a good job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is talking about the famous Lascaux cave paintings, which were created by humans and not dinosaurs. But, in this case, the caveman is saying that the dinosaur did his summer cave, meaning he drew pictures in the cave, which is something that only humans can do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "summer cave" can mean either a cave that is only used in the summer, or a cave that is decorated with paintings of summer scenes. In this case, the reptile has painted a scene from the summer, and the caveman is upset because he wanted a winter scene.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Lascaux is a famous site in France with cave paintings that are thousands of years old. The idea that a dinosaur would have been the artist behind them is absurd, but the joke suggests that the caveman is impressed with the dinosaur's work nonetheless.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The caveman is talking about a famous cave in France called Lascaux, which is famous for its cave paintings. The joke is that the caveman doesn't realize that the dinosaur couldn't have possibly done the paintings because dinosaurs were extinct long before humans existed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the lizard is a famous artist, and the caveman is bragging that he's seen the lizard's work in person. The joke is also clever because it uses a play on words --- "cave in" can mean either a collapse of a cave or a drawing on a cave wall.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="197.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="199.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
