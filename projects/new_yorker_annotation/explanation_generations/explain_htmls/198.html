I'm on deck.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "I'm on deck." In baseball, when a batter is up to bat, the next person in line to bat is said to be "on deck." However, in this woman's living room, there is an actual deck, and she is on it. The joke is clever because it's a play on words that uses the homophone "deck" (a platform on a ship) and the baseball term "on deck" (next in line to hit).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person on the phone is about to take their turn batting in the game, and so they have to hang up the phone. This is silly because it's not usual to play baseball inside someone's house, and so the person on the phone is probably not actually at a baseball game, but is instead just watching the game on television.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person is sitting on the sidelines of a baseball game, and they are talking on the phone. The person on the phone is unaware that the person they are talking to is sitting in the middle of a baseball game, and so they are surprised when the person they are talking to has to hang up abruptly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person on the phone is about to take their turn batting in the living room baseball game, and so they have to hang up the phone. This is unusual because it's not common to have to batting in living rooms, let alone to have to interrupt phone conversations to do so.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is on the phone, talking to someone, and she says she has to hang up because she's on deck. This is a double meaning: first, that she's next in line for the phone call, and second, that she's next up to bat in the baseball game. However, the fact that there is a baseball game going on in her living room is very strange, so the joke is funny because it's a absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who is "on deck" is about to have their turn at bat, and so they need to focus on the game. However, the person is on the phone, and so they are distracted. The joke is a play on the phrase "I have to hang up, I'm on deck", which is a way of saying that the person needs to end the phone call because they have something else they need to do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person sitting on the side is talking on the phone and is oblivious to the baseball game going on around them. They think they are on deck to bat next, when really, they are just sitting on the sidelines.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "on deck" is a term used in baseball when the next batter is waiting their turn. In this case, the woman is so scared by the baseball game going on in her living room that she's forgotten she's supposed to be on deck and is about to miss her turn.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it uses the metaphor of being "on deck" to mean "next in line". In baseball, the "on deck" batter is the next batter up to hit, who is waiting on deck to hit. However, in this context, the woman is on deck to be hit by a baseball, as the game is taking place in her living room. The fact that she's on deck to be hit by a baseball is a metaphor for how she's in a situation where she's about to be in a lot of pain.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "On deck" is a term used in baseball to indicate that the next batter is up. However, in this context, the woman is "on deck" to be the next victim of the baseball players. Therefore, the joke is funny because it's a clever way to warn the person on the other end of the phone that she's in danger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in baseball, "being on deck" means that you are next up to bat. However, in this situation, the woman is on deck to be hit by a ball, rather than to hit the ball. This is funny because it's a reversal of the usual situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person on the phone is about to play baseball, but instead of being at a baseball field, they are in the middle of a living room. Instead of being on deck, which is where hitters wait for their turn at bat, the person is on the sidelines. The joke plays on the fact that baseball terminology doesn't make sense when applied to other situations.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The person is on the phone, and they say they have to hang up because they are on deck. However, instead of meaning they are next in line to bat in the baseball game, it means they are next in line to use the phone. This is a funny pun because it is a homophone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the person talking on the phone is about to get up and play in the baseball game, which is absurd because they are in the middle of a living room. "On deck" is a term used in baseball to mean that the next batter is up. The joke is clever because it uses a common phrase in an unexpected context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person on the phone is about to play baseball, but instead of being at a baseball field, they are at home in their living room. Instead of being on a baseball diamond, they are "on deck" --- in other words, ready to swing a bat at a ball in their living room. This is a play on words because "to be on deck" can mean either to be next in line to hit a baseball, or to be next in line for something else.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
