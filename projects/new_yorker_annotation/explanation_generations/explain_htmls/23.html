The word "salmon" can refer to both the fish and the color. In this case, the fish are referred to as "salmon" because they are trying to jump up a waterfall. The word "virgin" refers to both someone who has never had sex and someone who is unblemished/pure. In this case, the fish are virgins because they are going to die before they can reproduce. The fact that the bear is making a comment on the fish's sexual status is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the virgin Salmon's innocent and chaste lifestyle, and the grizzly bear's predatory and sexual nature. The two animals are in their natural habitats, doing what they would normally do, but the joke provides a new, unexpected perspective on their actions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The salmon are swimming upstream to mate, but they are going to be eaten by the bear before they can mate. The word "virgin" can refer to someone who has never had sex, or it can refer to someone who has never had anything (in this case, referring to the salmon never having been caught by a bear before). The joke is clever because it's a double meaning that works on multiple levels.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common phrase "to die a virgin." In this case, the virgin is not a human, but a salmon, who are known for their strenuous journey up a river to spawn, only to die afterwards. The joke substitutes the human concept of "virginity" with the salmon's journey up the river, to highlight the similarity in the two situations.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "salmon" can mean both the fish and the color. In this case, the salmon are fish, and they are also jumping up the waterfall to spawn. Spawning is a sexual reproductive process, so the joke is that the salmon are "working hard to die a virgin" by going up the waterfall to mate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The work that the salmon are referring to is the work of upstream swimming against the current to reproduce. However, the word "work" can also mean the act of having sex. In this case, the salmon are saying that all their work swimming upstream was for nothing because they will die without having sex (i.e., they'll die virgins).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "salmon" can mean both the fish and the color. In this case, the fish are talking to the bear, and they are saying that all their hard work (swimming upstream to spawn) was for nothing, because they died without having sex. However, the other meaning of "salmon," the color, is also relevant: usually, when a fish dies, its body turns white. Thus, the salmon are also saying that they are still virgins (i.e., they haven't reproduced) because they died before they could spawn.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The fish are "jumping" up the waterfall, which can also be a term for having sex. In this case, the fish are trying to have sex, but they are going to die because they are going to jump up the waterfall instead of going around it. This is a silly situation because it is not possible for fish to have sex.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that, while fish normally die after they lay their eggs at the top of a waterfall and reproduce, the salmon in this case are jumping up the waterfall to their deaths without having reproduced. The joke implies that the salmon are wasting their time and effort because they will die without having accomplished their goal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of how it subverts the usual predator-prey relationship between bears and salmon. In this case, the salmon are the ones who are mocking the bear, who is stuck at the bottom of the waterfall, for all his hard work (swimming upstream) just to die without having sex. The joke turns the tables on the usual power dynamic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the salmon, which are going against the grain (swimming upstream) and the bear, which is going with the flow (standing in the river). The salmon are doing something difficult and against their nature, while the bear is doing something easy and natural. The joke is also funny because, while salmon are revered in many cultures, they are also known to be a food source, and so the idea of them "working" so hard just to be eaten by the bear is a bit tragicomic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at the salmon's situation. Salmon are born in freshwater rivers, but they travel to the ocean to live most of their lives. They then return to the rivers to breed and die. Because of this, they often die as virgins, since they usually don't have a chance to mate while in the ocean. The joke is clever because it re-contextualizes the word "virgin": in the salmon context, it means someone who hasn't had a chance to mate and reproduce, rather than someone who hasn't had sex.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because salmon usually die after they spawn, so they are effectively virgins when they die. The joke is emphasizing how short their life cycle is and how they die after they mate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at the salmon's situation. The salmon are swimming upstream to mate and lay their eggs, but they are being hunted by the grizzly bear. The salmon are unaware of the danger they are in, and the bear is able to take them by surprise. The joke makes fun of the salmon's naivete and their inevitable fate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while salmon are often used as a symbol of sexuality (due to their notoriously high levels of fertility), they are also a popular food item. So, the salmon are making a comment on the bear's diet --- the bear is going to all the trouble of catching them, but he's not going to get any sexual pleasure out of it, as he would if he ate them.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="22.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="24.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
