The fern is "amazing" because it is a plant, and plants are living things that are often amazing because of their beauty or utility. But the fern is also "amazing" because it is so out of place in the meeting, and because it is seemingly in charge of the meeting. The joke is clever because it is a pun on the word "amazing".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "he started out at the bottom and worked his way up". In this case, instead of a person working their way up through the company, it's a fern that started in the lobby and has worked its way into the boardroom. The fern has literally taken the place of the boss, which is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person is remarking on the fern's ascension through the company to become the boss. The joke is also a play on the common saying "he started out in the mail room", meaning he worked his way up through the company. The fern, being an inanimate object, could not have actually worked its way up through the company, making the joke even funnier.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="22.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="24.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
