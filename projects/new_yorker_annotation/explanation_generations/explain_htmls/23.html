I'm afraid I can't see you any longer.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The chameleon is trying to peek at the therapist's notes, but the therapist misunderstands and thinks that the chameleon is saying that it wants to see another therapist. The therapist then refers the chameleon to another therapist, which is ironic because chameleons don't need therapy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In this context, the word "see" is used in two ways: the first is the literal meaning, i.e., the psychiatrist can't see the patient (because the patient is a lizard), and the second is the figurative meaning, i.e., the psychiatrist can't help the patient (because the patient is a lizard).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unlikely that a chameleon would have the same sorts of psychological issues that humans do, and thus would not need to see a therapist. Furthermore, even if the chameleon did have psychological issues, it's not clear how the therapist would be able to help since they would not be able to understand what the chameleon is saying.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist has a chameleon on his couch, and the chameleon is mimicking the therapist's movements. This is a clever play on words because the therapist is saying that he "can't see" the patient anymore, but what he really means is that he can't see the chameleon anymore.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "I can't see you anymore" is typically used to break off a relationship, but in this context, it's literally true: because the lizard is a chameleon, it has the ability to camouflage and blend in with its surroundings. So, even though the lizard is right in front of him, the psychiatrist can't see it anymore.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the chameleon is not a human, and thus should not be going to therapy. But, even if the chameleon could go to therapy, the therapist would have to end the session because the chameleon is trying to read her notes. This is a violation of doctor-patient confidentiality.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the double-meaning of the word "see": in the normal context, the psychiatrist is saying that he can no longer see the patient because the patient is now invisible. However, in the context of the joke, the psychiatrist is saying that he can no longer see the patient because the patient is now a giant lizard.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lizard on the couch is actually a chameleon, and so it has the ability to change its appearance. The psychiatrist is saying that he can't see the lizard any longer because it has changed its appearance to blend in with the couch. This is a play on words because the lizard has actually become invisible, and so the psychiatrist can't see it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The psychiatrist is saying that he can't see the patient (the lizard) any longer, but the patient is actually a chameleon that has turned invisible. Thus, the psychiatrist is saying that he can't see the patient literally, and also that he can't see (or help) the patient figuratively.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lizard is so big that it's taking up the entire couch, and the psychiatrist can't even see the patient he's supposed to be helping. The lizard is also a chameleon, which suggests that it may be able to change its appearance and become invisible, which is why the psychiatrist can't see it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The psychiatrist is saying that he can't see the patient (the lizard) anymore because the lizard is now an invisible chameleon.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lizard is a chameleon, and it has blended in so well with the couch that the psychiatrist can't see it. The psychiatrist is 'referring' the lizard to another therapist because he can't help it, since he can't even see it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the psychiatrist is trying to end the session early because he's never seen a patient like this before, and he's clearly uncomfortable. The fact that the patient is a giant lizard is unexpected and makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In this context, the "referring" refers to the psychiatrist sending the patient to see another therapist, which is a common thing for psychiatrists to do. However, the fact that the patient is a lizard makes the word "referring" also refer to the fact that the lizard is, well, a lizard. So, the psychiatrist is saying that he can't see the lizard any longer because the lizard is, well, a lizard.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lizard is so big that it's taking up the whole couch, and the psychiatrist can't see the patient behind the lizard. This is a play on words because the lizard is both figuratively and literally blocking the view of the patient.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="22.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="24.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
