The deer are looking at a "deer crossing" sign, and the joke is that the sign is a little too pedestrian, or common. The deer are also pedestrian, in the sense that they walk on all fours, which is another meaning of the word.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The signs that the deer are looking at are "pedestrian crossing" signs, which typically show a stick figure of a person walking. However, since the deer are looking at signs with pictures of deer on them, the word "pedestrian" takes on a new meaning: a person who is not a deer. Thus, the joke is that the deer are looking at signs that are a little too " pedestrian" for their liking.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The deer are looking at road signs, which are usually mundane and not exciting, and the word "pedestrian" can also mean boring. The joke is also clever because it's true that deer are pedestrians, in the sense that they walk on the ground, just like people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are looking at a deer crossing sign, which is meant for pedestrians, or people walking on foot. However, deer are animals that walk on all fours, so they aren't really pedestrians. The joke is also a play on words, because the word "pedestrian" can also mean "boring" or "unimaginative."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are looking at a pedestrian crossing sign, which is meant for people, not animals. The deer are confused because they don't know what the sign means, and the joke is that the sign is too pedestrian, or simple, for them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The deer are looking at road signs, which are typically considered to be uninteresting, or "pedestrian." In this case, the deer are literally pedestrian, i.e., they are walking on two legs like humans. The joke is clever because it is a clever way to use the word "pedestrian" in a different context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Pedestrian" can refer to something boring or mundane, but it can also literally mean a person who walks. In this case, the deer are "pedestrian" in both senses of the word: they are boring because they are just looking at road signs, and they are literal pedestrians because they are walking on two legs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Pedestrian" can mean something that is ordinary or commonplace, but it also literally refers to a person who walks on foot. In this case, the deer are looking at road signs, which are quite pedestrian in nature, but the fact that the deer are looking at them is also quite pedestrian because deer can't appreciate art.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Pedestrian" can mean boring or unoriginal, but it also literally means a person who walks instead of drives. In this case, the deer are "pedestrian" in both senses of the word: they are thrilled by the artwork of road signs (which most people would find boring) and they are also literarily pedestrians, walking on two legs instead of four.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The deer are admiring road signs, which are meant for pedestrians (people walking on the road). The word "pedestrian" can also mean "boring" or "unimaginative," which is what the deer are saying about the road signs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The deer are looking at signs, which are traditionally meant for pedestrians, but since deer are not able to walk on two legs, they are technically not pedestrians. The joke is clever because it uses the same word, pedestrian, to mean both "ordinary" and "relating to walking".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The deer are looking at road signs, which are pedestrian, meaning dull or ordinary. However, the deer are also literal pedestrians, meaning they are walking on foot. So the joke is that the deer are both appreciating the art, which is pedestrian, and are also pedestrian themselves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are looking at road signs, which are extremely pedestrian, or mundane. The deer are looking at the signs in an art gallery, which is usually reserved for more high-brow or cultured art, so the signs seem out of place. Additionally, the deer are on their hind legs, which is a amusing sight gag.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are looking at road signs, which are meant for pedestrians (i.e., people walking on foot).
