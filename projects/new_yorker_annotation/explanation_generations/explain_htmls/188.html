The magician is saying that the trick he just did, which was shredding a piece of paper, is a trick that he learned from his lawyer. This is because, often, when people want to get rid of evidence, they will shred it so that it can't be read.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a common way to make something disappear is to shred it, which is what the magician is doing. However, the fact that the magician is using a ballot box to shred the paper makes the joke even funnier, because it's a way to make votes disappear --- which is something that lawyers are often accused of doing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the magician is doing a very unimpressive magic trick, and the assistant is disappointed. The joke is clever because the magician is actually doing a trick that is commonly used by lawyers --- shredding evidence so that it can't be used in court.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="187.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="189.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
