The only way to get help would be for somebody to carved the emergency phone number into a rock and hope that somebody finds it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on emergency services. The man with the lizard biting his ankle is in need of emergency assistance, but since he's a caveman, he can't dial 911 on a phone. Instead, he needs someone to carve the numbers 911 into the wall, which would be the caveman equivalent of calling for help.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man with the lizard biting his ankle needs help, and is telling the other cave people to carve '911' --- the emergency number --- into the cave wall so that somebody will see it and come help them. However, the other cave people misunderstand, and begin literally carving '911' into the wall.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the emergency telephone number in the United States is 911, but the cavepeople need someone to "carve" the number into the stone wall so that they can call for help. The joke is a pun on the fact that the cavepeople have no way to write down or communicate the number, and thus will have to rely on someone carving it into the wall.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's life is in danger and he needs help, but the only way to contact emergency services is by carving the numbers "911" into the wall of the cave. However, by the time somebody saw the carving and got help, the man would probably be long dead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The caveman is in a dire situation, with a dinosaur biting his leg, and he needs help. The only way to communicate for help is to carve symbols into the cave wall. However, instead of carving "SOS" or "HELP," he carves "911," the emergency phone number in the United States. This is funny because it highlights the absurdity of the situation: the man is in danger of being eaten by a dinosaur, but he still relies on a modern emergency service that wouldn't have existed during his time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the man's response to the situation. Instead of screaming or crying in pain, he calmly tells the other two people to carve the emergency phone number into the cave wall. This dry response is humorous because it is so unexpected and nonchalant given the circumstances.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "911" is the emergency phone number in the United States, so the person is saying that somebody should carve that into the cave wall so that the police can be called. However, "911" is also the number of the world's most popular brand of carving knife, so the person could also be saying that somebody should grab a carving knife and carve the person's ankle out of the reptile's mouth.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the event of an actual snake bite, the proper course of action would be to call for medical help. However, the cavemen are in a cave, so there is no cell service, and thus no way to call for help. The only way to get help would be for somebody to carve911into the cave wall, which would be a very slow and inefficient way to get help.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The cave people need to call for help, but since they have no concept of numbers or 911, the man says that somebody should carve the shapes of the numbers into the wall.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In this case, the man being bitten by the dinosaur needs help, and the best way to get help would be to carve the emergency number into the rock wall. However, since there are no phones in the time period, the only way to get help would be to physically carve the emergency number into the wall.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who is being bitten by the lizard needs medical attention but, since they are in a cave, there is no easy way to get help. The speaker is telling somebody to carve "911" into the cave wall so that somebody who finds the carving will know that the people inside need help.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cavepeople need to call for emergency services, but of course, they cannot because they don't have phones. The only way they can get help is if somebody etches the number "911" into the cave wall so that someone who sees it will know to call for help. However, it's unlikely that anyone would be able to see the writing in the dark cave, so the joke is doubly funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man's leg is being bitten by a dinosaur, and he is asking for somebody to carve the emergency phone number into his leg. This is a play on the phrase "carve out," which means to create or make something.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the emergency telephone number in the United States. The caveman is in such a dire situation that he needs emergency services, but of course, there were no emergency services during caveman times. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words --- the caveman needs somebody to "carve" the emergency number into the cave wall so that he can get help, but in order to do that, somebody would need to have already invented writing.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="215.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="217.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
