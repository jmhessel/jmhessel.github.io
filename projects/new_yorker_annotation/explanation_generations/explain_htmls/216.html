In either case, the lion's nonchalant attitude towards eating a person is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, either the lion or the bear has eaten a doctor, and they are both making a joke about how the doctor tasted. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words: "mediciney" is not a real word, but it sounds like it could be a descriptor for the taste of medicine.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lion and the bear are discussing the taste of the person they just ate, and they both agree that the person tasted like they had medicine in their system. The fact that they are animals makes the joke even funnier, since animals aren't supposed to be able to taste medicine.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the lion and bear are both carnivores who would typically eat meat, the fact that they ate a doctor suggests that they may have been unaccustomed to the taste. The joke is a play on the common saying "tastes like chicken", which is often used to describe the taste of unfamiliar meat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The lion is saying that the doctor tasted like medicine, i.e., he was medicinal. This is a double-meaning because people don't usually eat doctors (though in this case, the lion did), and so the word "medicine" is usually used to describe the Taste of something that would be good for you, like chicken soup.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lion and the bear are both acting like they are food critics, giving their two cents on the flavor of the doctor they just ate. The lion says the doctor tasted "mediciney," which is a play on how "medicinal" foods are supposed to taste bad but are good for you. The joke is clever because it's a play on words and it's also a play on the idea of lions and bears being wild animals that eat people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, one, it's a play on words --- the doctor tasted "mediciney" because he was a doctor, and two, it's a comment on how bears and lions often eat people. The fact that the bear and lion are discussing the taste of the doctor they just ate makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lion and the bear are discussing how the doctor they just ate tasted. The use of the word "mediciney" implies that the doctor's flesh wasn't particularly palatable, which makes sense given that doctors are often associated with being healthy and clean (and thus having little fat or flavor).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The lion and the bear have just eaten a doctor, and one of them makes a joke about how the doctor tasted. The joke is a pun on the fact that "medicine" can refer to both the medical profession and the actual medicine that people take.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a classic case of unexpected wordplay: the lion says that the doctor tasted "mediciney," meaning that he probably tasted like he was sick. However, the word "medicine" can also mean drugs or medication, which raises the possibility that the doctor tasted like he was on drugs. This would be particularly funny if the doctor was supposed to be helping the bear with his addiction, but instead, the bear ate him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The lion says that the doctor tasted "mediciney," but he could also be saying that the doctor tasted like he was sick. This is a play on the fact that "mediciney" is a word that can describe both the taste of medicine and the taste of something that is sick or diseased.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The lion and bear said that the doctor they ate "tasted kind of mediciney," which is both a pun on the fact that the doctor was a physician (i.e., someone who works in the medical field), and a description of the taste of the medicine the doctor probably had on them (e.g., pills, ointments, etc.).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The lion is saying that the doctor he ate tasted "mediciney", which could either mean that the doctor tasted like he had consumed medicine (perhaps due to the presence of a stethoscope or other doctor objects) or that the doctor tasted bad.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The lion says that the doctor "tasted kind of mediciney," which is a way of saying that the doctor tasted like he had taken medication. The lion is cleverly making a pun on the fact that he actually ate the doctor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one would not expect a lion or bear to have such a sophisticated palate as to be able to discern that the person they ate tasted like they had a medical background.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
