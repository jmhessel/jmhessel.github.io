However, the contrast between the man's age and the activity he's doing makes it funny. Furthermore, the fact that the children are scared of him implies that he's not just playing in the sandbox, but is also acting oddly, likely because he's mentally ill.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is actually in a sandbox on a rooftop, but he's pretending to be in a desert, weakly crawling towards an oasis. The kids watching him are thinking that he's really in a desert, and they feel bad for him because his parents never came to pick him up. However, the man is just pretending and his parents are probably fine.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a sad commentary on the man's life. It's implied that he's never grown up, and is still waiting for his parents to come get him. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the fact that sandboxes are for children.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a sad punchline. The adult man in the sandbox is there because he was never picked up by his parents as a child, and now he's returned to the sandbox as an adult. The two boys staring at him probably represent the younger versions of himself, nostalgic for a time when their own parents used to pick them up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a dark play on the fact that the man is in a sandbox. Instead of being there because he's playing or because his parents are picking him up, he's there because he was never picked up, implying that he's been there for a long time. The children's fear of him is also humorous because it's exaggerated.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is so foundationally weak that he's like a child who's never been picked up by his parents. This could mean that he's physically weak, or that he's never had any emotional support in his life. In either case, it's a sad thing to be compared to, and the joke is funny because it's unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the sandbox is on a rooftop, so the man's parents would never have been able to pick him up even if they had tried. The man is presumably crawling in the sandbox because he's trying to get away from the kids, but they can just follow him since they're on the same rooftop.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the man is "crawling" through the sandbox, which could be interpreted to mean that he's moving slowly and weakly, as if he's exhausted. However, the fact that he's "crawling" also suggests that he's not walking on two legs, but instead, moving on all fours like an animal. This interpretation is reinforced by the fact that the kids are looking at him as if he's a zoo animal. The joke suggests that the man was abandoned in the sandbox as a child, and he's never been picked up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is acting like he's in a desert, when in reality, he's just in a sandpit on a rooftop. His parents never came to pick him up, so he's been stuck there for a while. The kids watching him are probably imagining that he's in a real desert, which makes the joke funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a dark commentary on how some parents never pick up their children from the playground, and how those children are then forced to fend for themselves. The man in the joke is an exaggerated version of this, where he is so neglected that he has essentially become a feral animal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it references the fact that the man in the sandbox is an adult, and the boys are staring at him because he looks out of place. The joke imagines a scenario where the man was never picked up by his parents after playing in a sandbox as a child, and so he just never grew up and left the sandbox.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is literally crawling in a sandbox, but the joke is that he's also metaphorically "crawling" in the sense that he's stuck in a difficult/un enviable situation. The kids looking on represent how, often, when people are in a difficult situation, others will watch and do nothing to help, which is why the man's parents "never picked him up."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a re-contextualization of a common phrase. In this context, the phrase "pick up" would typically mean to fetch someone in a car from a location, like school or work. However, in this context, the phrase "pick up" takes on a more literal meaning: the man in the sandbox was never picked up by his parents, so he's been there for so long that he's turned into a desiccated husk of a man.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the situation: a man, who is presumably an adult, is playing in a sandbox meant for children. Furthermore, the man is playing in the sandbox as if he's in a dire situation (crawling across a desert), which makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's current predicament is due to his parents' negligence. He's in the sandbox because his parents never picked him up, and now he has to act like he's crawling through a desert because he's pretend-playing with the kids. The situation is made funnier by the fact that the man is probably too old to be playing in the sandpit.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
