They never seem to bother me.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a nonchalant comment on an extremely abnormal situation. The speaker is calmly chatting with the victim as if the victim's current predicament (being carried off by two giant hornets) is a totally normal thing that happens all the time, when in reality, it's a very strange and dangerous event. The contrast between the normalcy of the conversation and the bizarreness of the situation is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of gigantic hornets dragging a screaming woman away, the man's comment is nonchalant and doesn't reflect the gravity of the situation. The comment is also odd because, usually, it's the opposite: people usually bother hornets, not the other way around. But in this situation, the tables are turned.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is talking about how the hornets never bother him, despite the fact that they are currently in the process of kidnapping his wife. The fact that he is so nonchalant about the situation implies that this is a common occurrence, which is strange.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="63.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="65.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
