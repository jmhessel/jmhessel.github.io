This implies that the astronaut is either staying in a very tall hotel, or that the hotel is located in a place with a very low ceiling. In either case, it would be difficult for the astronaut to get to the top floor without the help of the elevator operator.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the astronaut is going to be going to space, even though they are clearly on earth and in an elevator. The joke is a play on the fact that astronauts need special equipment to breathe in space, which the man in the astronaut costume clearly does not have.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "on your own" can mean either that you are alone or that you are responsible for yourself. In this case, the elevator operator is saying that after the person in the space suit gets to the top floor, he will be responsible for himself, because the operator will not go any further. This is a clever way of saying that the person in the space suit is not welcome on the top floor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully pokes at the trope of sci-fi/fantasy stories where someone is transported to a new world and has to figure out how everything works. In this case, the man is an astronaut who is used to being in space, but the joke is that once he gets to the top floor of the building, he's on his own and will have to figure out how to get back down to earth without the help of an elevator.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "after this, we're on our own." In this case, the phrase is used literally; the astronaut is going to the top floor, and once they leave the elevator, they will be on their own in space. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the idea of an elevator operator; in most cases, the operator stays with the elevator, but in this case, the astronaut is going to a place where the operator can't follow.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "after this, we're on our own", which is often used to describe a situation where someone is no longer under the protection or jurisdiction of someone else. In this case, the man dressed as an astronaut is about to get off the elevator on the top floor, and the usher is telling him that he's on his own after that --- meaning that the astronaut will have to find his own way back down to the lower floors.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The top floor of a hotel is usually the penthouse, which is a luxurious suite. However, in this instance, the top floor is actually outer space, which is the farthest you can be from a hotel. Thus, the joke is that after the penthouse, you're on your own because there's nowhere else to go.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "After the top floor" can mean either that the astronaut is getting off on the top floor, or that after the top floor, there is no more oxygen, and the astronaut will be on their own in terms of breathing. The joke is clever because it's a pun that can be interpreted in two ways.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. In this case, the "top floor" is not the highest floor in the building, but rather a floor that is "out of this world," i.e., space. So, when the elevator operator says that the person in the space suit is on their own after the top floor, they are really saying that the person is on their own in space.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "after hours." Most elevators stop working after a certain time, so the elevator operator is telling the astronaut that he won't be able to go to the top floor because that's outside of his shift. However, the astronaut is likely used to being in space, where there are no floors, so he doesn't need the elevator operator anyway.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "after you", which is a polite way of saying "you first". In this situation, the astronaut is about to get off the elevator on the top floor, and the usher tells him that he's on his own after that. The joke is clever because it's a literal interpretation of the phrase.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common phrase "after this, you're on your own". The astronaut is about to finish his journey in the elevator and will have to go the rest of the way on his own. However, since he's an astronaut, he's probably used to being on his own and doesn't need the help.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the space suit is out of place in the elevator, and the operator doesn't know what to do with the person. The joke also plays on the fact that elevators have a limited number of floors they can go to, and once you reach the top floor, you are "on your own" in terms of getting to the next floor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "after hours", which is when most people would take the elevator. The implication is that the space-suited person is an astronaut who has just returned from a space mission, and is now trying to take the elevator to their home. However, the elevator operator doesn't want to take them any further than the top floor, since they are not sure what will happen once they leave the safety of the building.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "after you," which is a polite way of saying "you first." In this scenario, the polite phrase is turned on its head: instead of being a courteous offer for the other person to go first, the speaker is telling the astronaut that he will have to go first because he (the speaker) won't be going any higher. This is made funnier by the fact that the speaker is an elevator operator, whose job it is to take people to the top floor.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="63.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="65.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
