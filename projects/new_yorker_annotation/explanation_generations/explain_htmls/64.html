When someone says that something "is going south," they usually mean that it's going downhill or getting worse. However, in this context, the phrase takes on a literal meaning, as the classroom is full of birds, and when birds fly south, they are migrating. Thus, the experiment is about to fail because the birds are all leaving.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "go south" typically means that something is going wrong or heading in a bad direction. In this case, the experiment is about to go "south" in the literal sense, because the birds are all about to fly away. The joke is also a jab at the scientific method, which is often seen as rigid and inflexible; in this case, the experiment is going off the rails because the birds are behaving in an unexpected way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "south" can mean both the direction (as in, "the experiment is about to go in the wrong direction") or the United States (as in, "the experiment is about to go to the United States," which is where the ducks are from).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the experiment is not going well, and the scientists fear that it will "go south" --- meaning, that it will fail and they will not get the results they want. However, the fact that the experiment involves ducks adds a double-meaning to the joke, because "going south" can also refer to migrating south for the winter, which is something that ducks do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the fact that ducks are not known for being particularly intelligent animals. Therefore, the idea of ducks using laptops is already amusing. However, the joke takes this one step further by suggesting that the experiment itself is going to fail because the ducks are not smart enough to understand how to use the laptops. This is a play on the infinite monkey theorem, which states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter will eventually produce a given text, such as the works of Shakespeare. In this case, the ducks are the monkeys, and the text they are supposed to produce is whatever is being worked on in the classroom.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it's common for an experiment to "go south," in this context, the phrase takes on a new meaning: since the experiment is about ducks typing on laptops, the phrase "go south" references the fact that the ducks are likely to start flying away (south) if they get scared or agitated.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the word "south" can refer to a direction, but it can also be used to describe something that is failing. In this case, the experiment is failing because the ducks are not intelligent enough to use the computers, and the scientists are aware of this.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the saying "going south", which means going in the wrong direction, or failing. In this context, the experiment is going south because the ducks are getting impatient and leaving. The laptop computers in front of them represent the typewriters in the original infinite monkey theorem, which posits that if an infinite number of monkeys type for an infinite amount of time, they will eventually produce the complete works of Shakespeare. The joke is that, in this experiment, the monkeys are ducks, and they are not producing anything of value.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people in lab coats are about to begin an experiment with birds that are sitting in front of laptop computers, and the phrase "go south" usually means that something is going wrong or about to fail. In this context, the phrase takes on a new meaning: instead of the experiment failing, the birds are going to fly away (south), which would ruin the experiment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the saying "go south," which means to fail or decline. In this case, the speaker is worried that the experiment, which is training ducks to use laptop computers, might not be successful. The joke is also funny because it's unexpected: you wouldn't expect ducks to be able to use laptops, so the idea of them doing so in an experiment is amusing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "To go south" can mean to fail or to leave, and in this context, the joke is implying that the experiment (of teaching ducks to use laptops) is about to fail. However, the fact that the ducks are sitting at computers also suggests that they are going south, in the sense that they are leaving the classroom.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: "going south" means that something is going wrong, and in this case, the experiment is literally going south, as in the direction of the south pole. The joke is also clever because it's true that if the experiment did go south, the birds would likely fly away, which would indeed cause the experiment to fail.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully references the idiom "go south," which typically means that something is going wrong. In this context, the scientist is worried that the experiment, which is testing whether or not ducks can use laptops, is going to fail.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the phrase "go south" is often used to describe things going wrong, and in this case, it's because the ducks are headed towards the equator. The joke is also a play on words because the "southern" hemisphere is often referred to as the "bottom" hemisphere.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The speaker is worried that the experiment is going to fail, and "go south" can mean both "fail" and "head in a southern direction". The fact that the experiment is about ducks, which are often associated with the Southern US, makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="63.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="65.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
