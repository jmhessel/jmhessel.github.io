The man's reply is therefore a play on words, as he is saying that he prefers to drink hard liquor, or spirits, instead of beer.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man mistakes Death for a bartender and offers him a beer. It's a play on words because "spirits" can mean both ghosts/ghostly beings like Death, and also a type of alcoholic drink.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the traditional image of death is a Grim Reaper, who is often pictured holding a scythe. This makes the joke a play on words, because "spirits" can refer to both alcoholic beverages and ghosts/the undead. In this case, the man is offering Death a drink, and Death is declining because he prefers alcoholic beverages that are made withghosts/the undead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man offering the beer is asking the grim reaper if he would like a drink, and the grim reaper replies that he prefers spirits, meaning ghosts. This joke is clever because it is a pun: the grim reaper is, himself, a spirit, so he is saying that he prefers to drink alcohol that is in the same form as he is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Spirits" can mean both ghostly beings like Death, and alcoholic beverages. In this case, the man is offering Death a beer, but Death is not interested in beer because he prefers spirits (ghosts).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man at the bar offers the grim reaper a mug of beer, and the grim reaper replies "No, thanks—I prefer spirits." The Spirits in this case refers to alcoholic spirits, not ghosts or spirits. The joke is clever because it is impossible for the grim reaper to drink alcohol, as he is already dead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is offering a beer to Death, who then replies that he prefers spirits. This is a play on words, because "spirits" can refer to both ghosts/demons/etc., which are often associated with Death, as well as alcoholic beverages. Thus, Death is saying that he would rather have a drink that is associated with him (i.e., a spirit) than a beer.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Grim Reaper is traditionally associated with spirits, and so the man's offer of a beer is a pun on that.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. Thegrim reaper is a personification of death, so when the man offers him a beer, the reaper refuses, saying that he prefers spirits, which is another word for alcohol.

This could be interpreted to mean that he prefers hard liquor over beer, or it could mean that he prefers ghosts or other supernatural beings over mortals.

Death, obviously, does not actually consume beer or any other worldly substances. The fact that the man is offering him a beer anyway is humorous because it's a foolish gesture. Additionally, the fact that Death is sitting in a bar is also funny, because it's a place where people often go to escape the "reality" of death.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Grim Reaper is a personification of death, and thus he is associated with spirits, not beer. The joke works on a word play, because "spirits" can refer to both ghosts/ghosts and alcoholic beverages. In this case, the Grim Reaper is saying that he would rather have an alcoholic beverage, which makes sense given his status as the personification of death.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="124.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="126.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
