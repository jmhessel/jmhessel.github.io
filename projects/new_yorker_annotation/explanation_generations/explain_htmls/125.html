The joke implies that the father is not a very good shot, as evidenced by the fact that he only gets to see his son every other weekend. The fact that the only thing in color in the scene is the cherry also adds to the joke, as it implies that the boy is being used as a target by his father.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is shooting at the boy with a bow and arrow as if he is target practice. The fact that the boy is his son and that he is only shooting at him every other weekend implies that the man doesn't really care about him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the common child custody arrangement of "every other weekend" is framed in terms of a dangerous activity: shooting at a person with a cherry on their head. If the archer was shooting at a person with an apple on their head, it would be much easier, and thus less dangerous, to hit the target. The joke implies that the child custody arrangement is analogous to a dangerous activity, in that it is something that should only be done every other weekend (or less often) in order to minimize the risk of harm.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The boy is about to get shot in the head with an arrow, and the man says he now sees why the boy only gets to see him every other weekend. The word "see" can mean to visually perceive something, but it can also mean to understand or realize something. In this case, the man is saying that he understands why he doesn't get to see the boy more often: because the boy is in danger of being shot in the head.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The boy is being used as a target for archery practice, which is why there's a cherry on his head. The man is presumably the boy's father, and the joke is that he only gets to see his son every other weekend because he's a terrible shot.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boy's mother is using her son as target practice in archery. This would be viewed as child abuse in modern times, but given the context of the time period and the fact that apples are a more common target for archery practice, the joke is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The boy is Archer, and his father is shooting at him with a bow and arrow. The father is saying that he now understands why he only gets his son every other weekend, because if he had him full time, he would be shooting arrows at him all the time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boy's situation is dangerous: if the archer misses the cherry and hits the boy in the head, he could be seriously injured. The joke is humorously referencing the concept of child custody, where one parent has the child every other weekend, implying that the parent shooting at the cherry is not the child's primary caregiver and may not be the best person to have custody of the child.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the boy is in a dangerous situation, the archer is making a joke about how the boy's parents must not really want him because he only gets to see him every other weekend. The joke is dark because the archer is making light of the boy's dangerous situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the archer is the girl's father, and he only gets her every other weekend because he is shooting at her. The joke is a play on the phrase "I now see why you only get me every other weekend," which is usually said when someone understands why they have limited time with someone else. In this context, the archer understanding why he only gets his daughter every other weekend is because he is shooting at her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the usual situation (a boy with an apple on his head, waiting to be shot by an archer) and the current situation (a boy with a cherry on his head). The cherry is much smaller than the apple, making it harder to hit, and thus, the boy is in more danger. This contrast is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The boy is standing next to a "cherry" tree, and the man is shooting arrows at him for target practice. The fact that the man is only shooting at the boy every other weekend implies that the man is the boy's father, and the joke is that the father is only able to see his son every other weekend because he's such a bad shot.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it uses the idiom "I now see why" to explain why the person only gets the child every other weekend. The idiom usually is used to explain something that was not previously clear, but in this context, it is used to explain why the person can't have the child more often. The joke is clever because the idiom is true: the person does now see why they can only have the child every other weekend, because if they had the child more often, they would likely kill the child with an arrow.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is shooting at the boy with arrows, and the boy has a cherry on his head. The cherry is likely to be shot off the boy's head, which would injure him. The fact that the man only gets the boy every other weekend implies that he's not a very good father, which is why he's shooting arrows at him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the boy is the man's son, and that the man only gets him every other weekend because he is a terrible father. The fact that the man is shooting arrows at his own son is a (very dark) metaphor for how he treats him: with neglect and carelessness.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="124.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="126.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
