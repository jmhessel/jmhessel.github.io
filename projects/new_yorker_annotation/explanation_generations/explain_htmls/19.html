In this case, the caveman is quite literally "thinking outside the rock," or the cave, because he is sweeping the driveway in front of the garage. This is a silly thing to do because it's not something that cavemen would typically do, and it's also not something that is typically done in suburban neighborhoods.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the caveman who is sweeping is more forward-thinking than the other two cavemen. This is a play on the phrase "thinking outside the box," which means to think creatively or differently than the norm. In this case, the man is sweeping outside the "rock," or cave, which is a more modern activity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The term "outside the box" is often used to describe thinking that is not constrained by traditional ideas or solutions. In this case, the joke is that the man with the house is thinking "outside the rock" because he is living in a house instead of a cave. This is a clever way of saying that he is more advanced than the other cavemen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "thinking outside the box." The caveman is literally outside the rock (their cave), and is sweeping what appears to be a driveway. This is an unusual activity for a caveman, which is why it's funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "thinking outside the box" is a idiom meaning to think creatively or to come up with an innovative solution. However, in this context, the phrase is literal: the man is thinking outside the rock, or outside of the cave, where he lives. This is because he has built a house, which is something that people in caveman times wouldn't have done.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "thinking outside the box" means to think creatively or critically. However, in this instance, the man is literally thinking outside the rock, because he's a caveman and he lives in a cave. Moreover, the fact that he's sweeping a driveway is also anachronistic, because driveways didn't exist during the time of the cavemen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "rock" can mean both a type of material that can be found in caves, and it can also be a slang term for "house." In this joke, the word "rock" is being used in both senses: the man next door is literally thinking outside the rock (i.e. he's thinking outside of his house), and he's also thinking outside the rock (i.e. he's thinking outside of the caveman standard of living).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Thinking outside the box" is a common saying, which means to think creatively or come up with an unusual solution.

The caveman is sweeping the ground in front of the garage, which is anachronistic. The joke is implying that the caveman is doing something that is considered to be progressive and forward-thinking, even though it's something that is very simple.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman with the broom is doing something that is so out of the norm for his time period and location that it's amusing. He's not just thinking outside the box, he's thinking outside the rock (cave). The caveman with the broom is probably seen as very strange by his fellow cavemen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the idiom "thinking outside the box." The idiom usually means to think creatively, but in this context, it means that the caveman is thinking about something that is not literally inside the rock (i.e., the cave). This could be interpreted as the caveman being creative, or it could be interpreted as the caveman being literal-minded.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "thinking outside the box". In this case, the caveman is thinking outside the rock, meaning that he is thinking beyond the traditional concert of a caveman.
