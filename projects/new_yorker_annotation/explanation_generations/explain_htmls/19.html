The sandwich on the tracks looks like it could be a subway train, and the person making the joke is punning on the fact that the next stop is New York City's famous deli district, where many different types of sandwiches can be found.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the subway sandwich is so big that it is its own stop on the subway. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the subway sandwich is a type of sandwich that is usually found at a deli, so the "Next stop, New Deli" is a clever way to say that the sandwich is big and filling.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it imagines the sandwich as a subway train. The sandwich is "stuck" on the tracks, just as a subway train might be. And, like a real subway train, this one is headed to its next stop: New Deli.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man and woman are looking at a giant sandwich, which is unusual for a subway. The joke is a play on words, as the sandwich is so big it could be its own stop on the subway, rather than just an item for sale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the fact that the sandwich is much larger than a regular sandwich, and therefore could be used as a mode of transportation. The fact that it's called a "sub" sandwich also makes the joke funnier, as it's a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the subway sandwich is so big that it takes up the whole subway car. The joke is also a play on words, because the next stop is "New Deli," which is a pun on "New York City."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the sandwich is so big that it is its own subway stop. This is humorous because it is a highly unlikely scenario.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The sandwich on the tracks is a "sub", as in submarine sandwich, and also a sub, as in subway. So, the joke is that the sandwich is blocking the subway tracks, and the next stop for the subway will be at a deli, where presumably they will get a new sandwich.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the size of the sandwich is so big that it takes up the entire subway train. The joke is also a play on words, as the "next stop" is usually announced as the name of a city or town, but in this case it is the name of a deli, which is a place where you can get sandwiches.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it compares the sandwich on the tracks to a subway train. It's funny because the sandwich is much larger than a normal sandwich, and therefore more like a subway train. The joke is also a play on words, as "Next stop, New Deli" sounds like a typical announcement made on a subway train.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the sandwich on the tracks is so big that it resembles a subway train. Furthermore, the name of the sandwich, "sub," is also a homonym for the subway, which adds to the confusion. Finally, the joke playfully suggests that instead of stopping at the next station, the subway train will stop at a sandwich shop, which is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. Instead of saying "Next stop, New York," the speaker says "Next stop, New Deli," which is a play on the common Subway restaurant franchise. In this case, the huge sandwich in the subway is a play on the Subway sandwiches that are usually much smaller.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the sandwich is so large that it is blocking the subway tracks, and thus the train cannot move. The fact that the sandwich is called a "sub" is a play on words, as it is both a type of sandwich and a type of subway. The joke is also clever because the pun works in multiple ways: first, that the sandwich is blocking the subway, and second, that the sandwich is so large it could be its own stop on the subway.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The sandwich is on the subway tracks, so the next stop is "New Deli." This is a pun because "New Deli" is a place where sandwiches come from.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The sandwich on the tracks is a "sub", which is short for submarine sandwich. The fact that the sandwich is blocking the subway tracks is a metaphor for how a submarine can block a ship's path. The joke is also a play on the fact that the next stop on the subway is "New Deli", which is a pun on "New Delhi", the capital city of India.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="18.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="20.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
