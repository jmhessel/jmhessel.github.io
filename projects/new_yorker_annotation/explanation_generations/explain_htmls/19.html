In the context of a grocery store, "hit me with your cart" would mean that the person was accidentally hit by the other person's shopping cart. However, the fact that the person is a whale changes the meaning of the phrase to mean that the whale is hitting the other person with its cart on purpose. The threat to "hunt you down until the day I die" is also a play on words, as the whale is literally saying that it will hunt the other person down (in the water) until the day it dies.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a threat that is much more serious than what usually happens when someone is hit by a shopping cart. In this case, the customer who was hit is a whale, so the Amish man's threat to hunt him down is more real and more dangerous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a threat, but it's a non-threatening thing to say in the context of two people shopping. The whale is a gentle creature, and the Amish man is using a non-violent method of transportation, so the idea that either of them would hunt the other down is humorous.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="18.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="20.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
