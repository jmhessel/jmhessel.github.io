The phrase "get over yourself" is often used to tell someone that they are being egotistical or need to calm down. In this context, the man is telling the cat to "get over yourself" because the cat is acting like a king, when really, the cat is just a pet. The word "mouse" is also a homophone for the word "mousse," which is a type of dessert, which is why the man says "it was ONE mouse." The joke is clever because it is a play on words and also pokes fun at the fact that cats think they are royalty.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity between the mouse (which is a small, insignificant creature) and the cat's exaggerated reaction to it. A cat that is so fat that it is wearing a crown is probably not in danger of being killed by a single mouse, yet, the cat is acting like it is. This overreaction is funny because it is disproportionate to the threat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the cat is acting like a king, giving him status and power above the couple, in reality, he is just a house cat that probably caught one mouse. The woman's concerned look could be interpreted as worry that the cat is going to expect them to wait on him hand and foot now that he has been elevated to royalty.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat looks like it is very proud of itself, as if it has done something great. But, in reality, the cat has only killed one mouse. The woman is telling the cat to not be so proud, because it is only one mouse and it is not a big deal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is worried about the mouse, which she probably thinks is a rat, and the man tells her to "get over" herself, meaning that she's overreacting about the situation. However, the woman misinterprets his statement to mean that he's telling her to "get over" the mouse, which she does, literally.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is acting like a spoiled monarch, and the woman is telling him to stop being so dramatic. The joke is funny because it's a play on the saying "the king is dead, long live the king." In this case, the cat is the king, and he's only been king for a short time (one mouse), but he's already acting like a spoiled ruler.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "get over yourself" is often used to tell someone to stop being so self-centered, but in this case, it's being used to tell the cat to stop being so monarchical. The man is telling the cat that he shouldn't act like he's above others just because he caught and killed a mouse; in reality, the man did the majority of the work in setting the trap and getting rid of the mouse.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is acting like a king, but it's just a cat. The woman is telling the cat to stop acting like it's better than everyone else, because the cat only caught one mouse.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is acting like a king, but the woman is telling him to get over himself because he's just a cat. The joke is clever because it's using the idiom "get over yourself" in a literal way: in this context, the cat needs to get off his throne (i.e., the chair) because he's just a cat, not a king.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is so self-important that it's wearing a crown, as if it's a king. The woman's exclamation is funny because it's a play on words: "get over yourself" can mean to stop being so arrogant/conceited, but in this context it means that the cat needs to stop being so full of itself because it's only killed one mouse.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the cat is clearly very pleased with itself for catching a mouse, the woman is not as impressed. The mouse is a small creature, and catching one is not a very difficult feat for a cat, even a fat one. The cat's self-importance in the situation is absurd, and the woman's lack of reaction to the cat's big catch highlights that absurdity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the situation: the cat is dressed up like a king, which suggests that he is acting high and mighty, BUT he only killed ONE mouse. This joke pokes fun at the discrepancy between the cat's regal appearance and his actual accomplishments.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is acting like a king, but it is just a cat. The king usually has a large kingdom and many subjects. In contrast, the cat only has one mouse. The woman is telling the cat to stop acting like it's a big deal, because it's not.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The cat is clearly supposed to be a king, which is a high ranking individual who is revered and respected by his or her subjects. However, the cat in this situation is fat, which is usually associated with being lazy. The woman's comment is a jab at the cat's laziness, saying that he is overreacting to having killed just one mouse.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is acting like a king, and the woman is telling him to "get over himself." The joke is also funny because it's a play on words; the mouse that the cat caught is a literal mouse, but it could also be metaphorical, in the sense that the cat is acting like he's caught a big, important mouse.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="81.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="83.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
