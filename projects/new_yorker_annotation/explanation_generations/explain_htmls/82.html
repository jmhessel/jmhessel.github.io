The fact that the man is sitting on the side of the wall could mean that he literally doesn't share a bed with his wife, which could be the reason why they are seeking counseling. However, it could also mean that he figuratively doesn't share a bed with her, meaning that they aren't close anymore and don't have a good relationship.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is impossible for the man to be in the chair on the wall, and yet he is. This must mean that either the woman or the man is not in the room physically, but only in spirit. Therefore, the counselor is joking that the couple must not share the same bed, since they are apparently not even in the same room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man interviewing the woman asks if she doesn't sleep in the same bed as her husband, to which she replies that they don't share a bed because they are divorced. The man interviewing her then says that he assumed as much because the other man in the room is stuck to the wall. In this context, "share the same bed" means to have a close relationship with someone, but the man interviewing the woman is using it to mean literal sharing of a bed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man interviewing the woman for the job is asking if she's married, and the woman says no, they don't share the same bed. The word "share" can mean two things: to physically share something (like a bed), or to emotionally share something (like feelings). In this case, the woman is saying that she and her husband don't emotionally share anything, which is why they are getting a divorce. The fact that the man interviewing her doesn't pick up on this double-meaning is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a normal job interview, the question would be to ask if the person shares the same bed with their spouse, which would usually be a personal question that would be inappropriate. However, in this context, the question is relevant because the chair being stuck to the wall implies that the couple is going through a divorce and are not currently living together.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "to share the same bed" can mean either to literally sleep in the same bed, or to have a good relationship (i.e., to be on good terms). However, in this context, the fact that the chair is stuck to the wall suggests that the man and woman do not have a good relationship, which is why the interviewer jokes that they "don't share the same bed."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man sitting on the wall cannot physically share the same bed as the woman, because he is not in the same room as her. The joke implies that the reason they don't share the same bed is because they are getting a divorce, and the man has moved out of the house. The fact that he is now sitting on the wall in the counselor's office emphasizes the physical and emotional distance between the two former spouses.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man interviewed is talking about how he and his wife don't sleep in the same bed, but the counselor is sitting in a chair that is stuck to the wall, so the man's comment also applies to the counselor's situation. This joke would be funnier if the counselor was also interviewing the man for a job, as it would imply that the counselor is in a bad marriage as well.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man on the wall is not really there, he is just a figment of the woman's imagination. The joke is that the man on the wall is not really physically present in the room, so of course, he and the woman do not share the same bed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is an example of verbal irony. The woman has just said that her husband "slept on the couch last night," to which the counselor replies, "I take it you don't share the same bed." The woman's husband sleeping on the couch is evidence that they don't share the same bed, so the counselor's statement is sarcastic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because often when people go to therapy, it is because they have relationship problems. In this case, one of the biggest problems in the relationship is that they literally cannot share the same bed because one of them is stuck to the wall. The joke captures the absurdity of the situation while still being relatable because often relationship problems can feel like they are impossible to solve.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The fact that the man is sitting on the side of the wall suggests that he does not share the same bed with his wife, which implies that they are not sleeping together. However, the phrase "I take it you don't share the same bed" can also be interpreted to mean that the man and his wife do not see eye-to-eye on things, which would be a reason to seek family therapy in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in a counseling/divorce context, it would be normal to ask a couple whether or not they share the same bed. However, the fact that the chair is stuck to the wall suggests that the couple doesn't share the same bed because they can't even share the same chair. The joke is clever because it's a double-meaning: on one level, the question is about whether or not the couple shares the same bed, and on another level, it's about whether or not the couple can even share the same chair.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the wife is insinuating that the husband's adultery is the reason why they don't sleep in the same bed, when in reality it is because the husband prefers to defy the laws of gravity by sleeping on the wall.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, given that the two men are sitting on different parts of the wall, it is highly unlikely that they would be able to share the same bed. In other words, the joke is saying that the two men are so different from each other that they cannot even share a bed, let alone be married.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
