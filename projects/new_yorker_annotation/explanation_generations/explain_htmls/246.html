He is in a China shop, which is full of delicate porcelain items, and he is a big bull. So, by simply being there, he is complicating things and making it more difficult for the shop owner.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull is in a shop full of porcelain, which is a type of china. The bull is making a mess of the shop, and the woman is looking on in horror. The bull is probably going to break something, and the shop owner is saying that he tends to complicate simple things. This is a play on words because the bull is indeed complicating things in the shop, but the shop owner is also saying that he (the shop owner) is the one who iscomplicating things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's true: the bull in the China shop is a complicated creature in a simple situation. A bull in a china shop is a destructive force, so the fact that this bull is just inspecting a cup is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull is making a self-deprecating comment. The bull is aware that he is a large and complicated animal, and that his presence in the china shop makes the simple act of shopping much more complicated.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word " complicate " can mean to make something more difficult or harder to understand, but it can also mean to damage or destroy something. In this case, the bull is talking about how it likes to "complicate" things by breaking them --- which is a very natural thing for a bull to do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull is saying that he is the one who complicated the situation --- by being in a china shop, he has made it more complicated for the customers and workers. But, of course, the bull didn't know he was going to do that when he walked into the china shop; it's a simple mistake that anyone could have made.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull is in a china shop, which is a place where things are delicate and easily broken. The fact that the bull is being well-mannered and not breaking anything is a complication of the simple situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull is doing something that is very out of the ordinary: shopping for porcelain cups in a china shop. The fact that the bull is the shop owner makes the situation even more absurd. The joke is a play on words, as the word "complicate" can mean both "to make more complex" and "to cause difficulty." In this case, the bull is causing difficulty for the woman who is trying to shop in the store.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull is in a China shop and is inspecting a cup. Bulls are not known for their delicate handling of fragile objects, so the fact that this bull is in a China shop and is inspecting a cup is absurd. The joke is further compounded by the fact that the shop owner is also a bull, which is impossible.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull is in a china shop, which is an obviously dangerous situation. The bull is playing with the cups, which are fragile and could easily break. However, the bull is complicating the situation by trying to figure out how the cup works, when it would be much simpler to just leave it alone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull is in a china shop, which is a place where things are delicate and can easily be broken. The bull, meanwhile, is an animal that is known for being very large and strong, and for sometimes breaking things. Thus, the bull is "complicating" the simple situation by being in a place where it could easily break something.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is telling the shop owner that he shouldn't worry, she'll take care of the bull, and the shop owner is telling her that he always tries to make things more complicated than they need to be. In this instance, the shop owner has managed to make a simple situation - a bull in a china shop - into a much more complicated one by being the shop owner.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull has broken a number of plates and cups in the store, and is now inspecting a cup. The bull is saying that he "tends to complicate simple things," which is a play on words because the bull is complicating the simplicity of the shop owner's life by breaking his things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull is acting like he is a complicated individual. This is ironic because bulls are usually seen as simple creatures. The woman is also looking on in confusion, which implies that she doesn't understand what the bull is saying.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker, who is the bull in the china shop, is saying that he likes to complicate things, which is exactly what he is doing by being in the china shop. The joke is clever because it is a pun: the word "complicate" can mean to make something more difficult, or it can mean to mix two things together, like the bull is doing by being in the china shop.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="245.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="247.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
