"Execution" can mean two different things: the act of killing someone, or the act of completing something perfectly. In this case, the man has "perfectly executed" a dive, but the pirates are shocked because they presumably were expecting him to be killed. The double meaning of "execution" is what makes this joke humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who just did the dive is being executed by the pirates. The pirates are amazed at how perfectly he executed the dive, not realizing that they are about to kill him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is being executed is doing a perfect dive, which would usually be lauded. However, in this context, the dive is going to result in his death, which makes it a less than perfect execution.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who was just executed did a perfect dive off the plank. The word "perfect" can mean two things here: first, that the dive was executed perfectly (i.e., he didn't slip or trip), and second, that the dive was perfectly executed (i.e., he died).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The pirate is Executioner, and the word "execution" can mean the carrying out of a plan or the killing of someone. In this case, the pirate is execute the man by making him walk the plank, and the man executed the dive perfectly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "execution": in this case, the pirates are executing the man by making him walk the plank, but the man is also executing a perfect dive, winning gold at the Olympics. The man's successful dive in the face of death makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's actions go against the typical expectations of someone being forced to walk the plank. Walking the plank is supposed to be a death sentence, but the man perfectly executes a dive, showing that he is skilled and talented. The pirates are shocked because they were expecting him to die.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The pirate is executed by diving off the plank instead of being killed by the pirates. This is a perfect execution because it is exactly what was supposed to happen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The pirate is being executed by being made to walk the plank, and he does so perfectly, like a professional diver. The pirate next to him comments on how perfectly he executed the diving portion of the execution.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the pun on the word "execution". A Perfect 10 is the highest possible score a diver can receive in the Olympics. So, the pirate is making a joke that the man who was just executed by being forced to walk the plank, did a "perfect" dive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man who was "executed" by being made to walk the plank is now a perfect diver, executing a perfect dive. This is a contrast to the usual connotation of "execution," which is a punishment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man who is diving off of the plank is doing so perfectly, in terms of execution (as in, he is following through with the plank-diving challenge/task). However, the pirate's use of the word "execution" suggests a different meaning: the man is going to be killed when he hits the water. The double meaning of the word "execution" is what makes this joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in most cases, when someone is forced to walk the plank, they are pushed or made to walk off of it against their will. In this case, the man jumps of his own accord, and does a perfect dive. The pirates are shocked because they were expecting the man to be scared or resistant, but instead he executed a perfect dive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in most cases, "execution" is a noun meaning the carrying out of a death sentence. However, in this case, it is used as a verb meaning "to perform perfectly." The man who is diving off the plank is doing so perfectly, and the pirates are shocked because they expected him to be scared or hesitant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the scene is literally executing a dive, but the pirates are also impressed with how well he executed the dive. This is ironic because usually people who are forced to walk the plank are not given praise for their method of island-escape.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
