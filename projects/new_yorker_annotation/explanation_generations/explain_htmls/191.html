The alien doctor is going to give the human patient a "physical examination." However, the joke is that the alien is going to give the human something for their "humanity," which is a trait that aliens don't have. This is a clever way of saying that the alien is going to give the human a shot or some other kind of medical treatment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the alien doctor is going to treat the patient's humanity, or common sense of being human, as if it's an illness. In other words, the joke pokes fun at how some people might think that aliens are so advanced that they know things that humans don't, or that they can solve problems that humans can't.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though aliens don't exist, if they did, they would presumably be more medically advanced than humans. As such, the fact that the alien doctor is giving the patient something for their humanity implies that the patient is less evolved than the alien, even though it's the other way around.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because thealien doctor is giving the patient a medicine that will make the patient more human. This is ironic because, as an alien, the doctor him or herself is not human. The joke is also a play on words because the doctor is giving the patient a "humanity" --- which can be both a quality of being humane or the group of humans collectively.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the alien is talking about giving the patient a medicine for their humanity. This is a play on words because humanity can mean both the quality of being human, as well as the human race as a whole. So, the alien is saying that the patient is not fully human, and thus needs medicine to become more human.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the alien doctor is going to give the patient a medicine that will make the patient more human. This is funny because it is a play on the phrase "something for your trouble," which is often used to thank someone for their help. In this case, the alien doctor is thanking the patient for being human, and the medicine will make the patient even more human.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the alien doctor is going to give the human patient a physical examination, but instead of the normal, human way of doing it, the alien doctor is going to examine the patient for their "humanity." This is a play on words, because the alien doctor is looking for signs of humanity in the patient, but also, the alien doctor is going to give the patient a shot or medicine to help them be more human.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor, who is an alien, is going to give the patient a medicine for their human condition. The joke implies that being human is a disease, and that aliens are more advanced and evolved than humans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the alien doctor is saying that he's going to give the patient a medicine for his "humanity." In other words, the doctor is trying to help the patient become less human. However, since the patient is human, this is impossible, and thus, the joke is funny because it is a contradiction.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The doctor is going to give the patient a physical examination, which will test for their humanity. However, the patient interprets this as the doctor being from another planet and wanting to give something to the patient for being human.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the alien is giving the patient a medicine that will make him more human. The joke is clever because, of course, aliens are not human, so the idea of an alien trying to make someone more human is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the alien doctor is going to give the patient a 'humanity pill'. This is a play on the fact that aliens are often seen as non-human, or inhuman, creatures. The joke is also funny because, of course, there is no such thing as a pill that can make someone human.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the alien doctor is going to treat the patient's humanity, which is a condition that does not exist. This is a play on words because normally, when a doctor says they are going to give a patient something for their "humanity," they mean their compassion or their kindness. However, in this case, the doctor actually means the patient's species, which is human.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the alien doctor is saying that he's going to give the patient a medicine for his humanity. This is ironic because, by definition, aliens are not human and so the patient cannot have humanity. The medicine, then, must be for something else entirely.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the alien doctor is going to give the human patient a medicine that will make him more like an alien, i.e. less human. This is a play on the common phrase "take something for your cold/headache/etc." to mean that the medicine will make the symptoms go away. In this case, the medicine will make the patient less human.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="190.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="192.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
