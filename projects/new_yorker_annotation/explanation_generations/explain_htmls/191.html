The word "day care" can mean two things: 1) a place where children are cared for during the day, or 2) a group or program that helps people during the day. In this case, the "day care" is a group of adults who come to the office to play in the sandbox, implying that they need help during the day. This is a joke about how some adults never really grow up and still need help with things that most people consider to be child's play.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while most companies have some sort of daycare program for their employees' children, it's very unusual for the company to have a daycare program for the employees themselves. In this joke, the company's day care program is so good that the employees have been coming since 1970, implying that they never grew up and still need to be cared for.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the company has been providing day care for its employees' children since 1970, but the day care is so poor that the employees never grew up and still need to use the sandpit.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="190.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="192.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
