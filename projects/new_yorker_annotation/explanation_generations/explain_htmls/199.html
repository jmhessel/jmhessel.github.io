An "undertow" is a dangerous current of water that can pull swimmers under the surface and drown them. A "combover" is a hairstyle where a person tries to cover up a bald spot by combing their hair over from the side. In this case, the undertow is being caused by the giant wave, which also has a combover, a hairstyle often associated with old men. The joke is clever because it is both a play on words and a visual pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Undertow" usually refers to the dangerous currents beneath the waves that can pull swimmers down. In this case, the "undertow" is the group of people on the rowboat who are immigrants, trying to illegally enter the United States. The "comb over" is the hairdo that the gigantic face on the wave is sporting. The joke is clever because it's technically true --- the undertow is a more immediate threat, but the comb over is more unsightly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "undertow" is a dangerous current of water that can pull people under the waves, while a "comb over" is a hairstyle where people try to cover up bald spots by combing their hair over from the side. The joke implies that the undertow is actually more dangerous than the comb over, which is just an attempt to cover up something that isn't dangerous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the wave is making an ominous face, as if it is about to do something bad to the people in the boat. However, the joke is also a play on words, because "undertow" can refer to a dangerous current of water that can pull people under, but it can also refer to a type of hairstyle (a "combover") where a person tries to cover up a bald spot by combing their hair over it. In this case, the joke is implying that the bald spot (represented by the undertow) is actually more dangerous than the combover.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The "undertow" is a dangerous current of water that can pull swimmers under the surface and drown them. However, "undertow" can also refer to the negative effects of immigration, e.g., that immigrants take jobs away from native citizens. In this case, the joke is clever because it is both a play on words and a political comment. The "combover" is a type of hairstyle in which a person tries to cover up a bald spot by combing their hair over it. The hairstyle is often associated with Donald Trump, a controversial figure in the immigration debate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the wind wave, in addition to having a scary face, also has a combover, a hairstyle that is often associated with older men. The joke implies that the person is more scared of the hairstyle than the actual wave, which is a much more dangerous threat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The undertow is a strong current of water that can pull swimmers under the water, while a combover is a hairstyle that involves combing hair over from one side to cover up a bald spot. In this instance, the undertow is metaphorical for the difficulties immigrants face when coming to America, while the combover is a metaphor for Donald Trump, who has famously bad hair.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Undertow" usually refers to the strong current of water that can pull swimmers away from the shore. In this case, the "undertow" is the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents who are pulling people away from the safety of the shore (i.e., the United States). The "combover" is the hairstyle often associated with Donald Trump, who has been a supporter of ICE agents and their actions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the movie "Jaws." In that movie, a gigantic shark appears out of nowhere and terrorizes the people on a small boat. The speaker is saying that the current situation, with a gigantic face on a wave looking down at them, is reminiscent of the shark scene from "Jaws." They are wondering if the face is more worried about the people in the boat, or if the face is more worried about its hair style (a combover is a type of hairstyle that is often considered to be bad).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "undertow" can refer to a dangerous current of water that can pulled swimmers under and drown them. In this case, the undertow is the dangerous wave trying to capsized the boat. However, "undertow" can also refer to the negative effects of something, like the "undertow" of a bad economy. In this case, the undertow is the wave of immigrants trying to enter the United States illegally. The combover is a hairstyle often associated with older men, which is ironic because the people in the boat are presumably trying to escape from the wave to safety.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "undertow" is a dangerous current of water that can pull people under if they're not careful. In this case, the undertow is the dangerous force that pulls people away from their homeland (the Statue of Liberty) and into the United States (the boat). The "combover" is a hairstyle where people try to cover up a bald spot by combing their hair over it. In this case, the combover is the hairstyle that people from other countries use to try to cover up their homeland's culture (by combing it over with American culture).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "undertow" is a dangerous current of water that can pull swimmers down, and the "combover" is a hairstyle where someone tries to cover up a bald spot by combing their hair over it. In this case, the waves have a face and arms, which makes them look like they could be bald and trying to comb their hair over it, which is amusing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the face on the wave is that of Donald Trump, who is well-known for his unusual hairstyle, which has been described as a "comb over." The speaker is saying that they don't know which is worse: the dangerous situation they are in, or the fact that Trump's hair is so bad.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="198.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="200.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
