In this case, the reptile didn't break his lease, but he did damage the cave walls with his paintings, so the cavemen joke that he'll have to forfeit his security deposit. The joke is clever because it's a play on words (lease/paintings) and on the fact that reptiles don't have opposable thumbs and couldn't actually break a lease agreement even if they wanted to.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the landlord will likely never see the security deposit again if the tenant damages the property, as is the case here. In this instance, the damage is caused by a giant lizard drawing on the cave wall, which is something that would never happen in real life. The absurdity of the situation is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The security deposit in this case is the Giant Lizard's life, since the cavemen are going to kill him for damaging the cave wall.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in modern times, if you damage your rented apartment beyond what is considered "normal wear and tear," you will forfeit your security deposit. The joke is that the caveman's landlord will likely not be happy about the state of the cave after the lizard's painting session, and the caveman will forfeit his security deposit as a result.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the caveman who is spying on the lizard is the owner of the cave, and is angry because the lizard is drawing on the wall. This is silly because, of course, a lizard couldn't have signed a lease agreement with the caveman.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "security deposit" is usually money that you put down to make sure you don't damage something, like an apartment. But in this case, the "security deposit" is the lizard's tail, which he apparently used as a paintbrush to make the drawing. The joke is that the lizard will never get his tail back, so he's lost his security deposit.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "deposit" can refer to both money placed in a bank account, and to the action of leaving something behind. In this case, the joke is that the lizard is going to be charged a fee for leaving his drawing on the cave wall, because it will be considered vandalism.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The caveman is spying on the lizard, who is drawing on the cave wall. The word "deposit" can mean both a sum of money given to secure the performance of a contract, or a natural accumulation. In this case, the security deposit is the natural accumulation of the lizard's feces, which he will surely lose when the caveman tells the landlord about the mess.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lizard's drawing on the wall is likely going to damage the property, and the owner (or security deposit company) will be upset. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words: the phrase "security deposit" can also refer to the money paid upfront to cover potential damages, which the lizard will not be getting back now that he's ruined the wall.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the damage the lizard is doing to the wall is significant, and it's unlikely that the caveman who owns the dwelling will be able to get his security deposit back from the landlord given the state of the wall. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the phrase "security deposit" is usually used in the context of renting an apartment or house, but in this caveman context, it's the deposit a landlord would require to ensure that the tenant leaves the property in the same condition as when they moved in.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cavemen are treating the dinosaur like he's a tenant who has damaged the cave walls with his paintings. They are implying that he will have to forfeit his security deposit because of the damage he has caused. This is humorous because it's a very modern way of thinking about a situation that is very old, and because usually, it's the landlord who has to forfeit the security deposit, not the tenant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it points out the absurdity of the situation: a lizard is drawing on a cave wall, which is something that typically only humans do. Because he's doing something that only humans can do, the landlord of the cave is going to keep his security deposit (which is probably just a rock or something) because he's caused damage to the property.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that, when someone damages property they've rented, they often lose their security deposit. In this case, the situation is even more dire because, not only has the reptile damaged the cave by painting on the walls, but he's also violated the lease agreement by not being a mammal. Therefore, not only will he lose his security deposit, but he'll also be evicted from the cave.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Security deposit" can refer to the money you put down when you rent an apartment to show that you can take care of the place, but in this case, it's a deposit for a cave that the caveman is likely never going to see again because the lizard has ruined it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the security deposit is usually something that a renter puts down in order to make sure they don't damage the property they're renting. In this case, the lizard is damaging property --- the cave wall --- by drawing on it. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the phrase "kiss of death" usually refers to something that is detrimental, and in this case, the lizard's drawing is literally the kiss of death for the security deposit.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="198.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="200.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
