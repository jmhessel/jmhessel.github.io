I've got to get back to staring out the window.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is the boss of the company, and it's behaving in a way that's typically associated with cats: aloof, disinterested, and uninvolved. In other words, the cat is behaving like it couldn't care less about the board meeting, and it's only there because it's required. This is in contrast to the dogs, who are very interested in the meeting and are looking attentively at the cat boss.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a stereotype that cats are lazy and uninterested in work, while dogs are known for being loyal and hard workers. Thus, the fact that the cat is the boss of the company and is telling the dogs to hurry up with the meeting implies that the cat is taking advantage of its position of power. The joke is also a play on the fact that cats sometimes stare out windows idly, implying that the cat boss would rather be doing that than dealing with its employees.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the stereotype that cats are lazy and disinterested in work, yet, in this case, the cat is the boss of the company. The joke is also funny because of the reversal of the normal roles of dogs and cats: usually, dogs are the loyal and subservient animals, while cats are more independent.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss, who is a cat, is telling the employees, who are all dogs, to hurry up with the meeting so that he can go back to staring out the window. The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that cats are lazy and disinterested, while dogs are hard workers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while in most board meetings, it's important to appear attentive and interested in the discussion, in this case, the cat boss is more interested in staring out the window, and doesn't care about the dogs' opinions. The joke is a play on the idea that cats are aloof and uninterested in others.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the cat boss is not taking the meeting seriously, and is instead more interested in staring out the window, which is something that cats are often known to do. This is surprising because, in most board meetings, the boss is the one leading the meeting and keeping things on track, but in this case, the cat boss is not paying attention at all.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a common stereotype that cats are lazy, and the fact that this particular cat is the boss of the company despite being lazy is absurd. Furthermore, the joke implies that the cat only got the job because it's a cat, and not because of any merit or qualifications.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype of a 'lazy cat.' The cat is the boss, but instead of being engaged in the meeting, it's more interested in looking out the window. This implies that the cat isn't really doing its job, but is still in a position of power. The dogs, who are actually paying attention to the meeting, are subservient to the cat, which is a reversal of the typical power dynamic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that cats are lazy and uninterested in work (unlike dogs). The cat is saying that it needs to get back to staring out the window, a leisure activity, implying that it doesn't have much else to do at work. This is in contrast to the dogs, who are presumably working hard.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the cat does not care about the meeting, and is only there because it's required, or because it's the boss. The joke also implies that the other dogs are only there to serve the cat, and that they have no say in the meeting. This is a play on the stereotype that cats are lazy and aloof, while dogs are loyal and obedient.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because cats are often seen as lazy and uninterested in work, yet this cat is the boss of the company. The implication is that the cat doesn't do much work, and is more interested in napping or staring out the window, yet is still in charge of the company. The joke is a commentary on how those in power often don't deserve it, and may not even work hard.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that cats are lazy and uninterested in work, while dogs are eager and hard-working. In this situation, the roles are reversed, with the cat being the boss and the dogs being the employees, but the cat still exhibiting the stereotypical aloof attitude.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in most board meetings, the people who are running the meeting (i.e. the boss) try to keep things moving along quickly so that they can get back to work. However, in this case, the boss is a cat, and cats are notoriously lazy. So, the joke is that the cat boss is only interested in the board meeting insofar as it allows him to take a break from staring out the window, something he would presumably be doing anyway.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that dogs are not as intelligent as cats. In this scene, the dog employees are being told by their cat boss to keep the meeting brief, and the cat boss plans to go back to staring out the window --- a relatively mindless activity --- once the meeting is over. This is funny because it implies that the cat doesn't care about the dogs' work, and is only concerned with its own leisure.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the cat boss doesn't really care about the board meeting or the company, and would rather just stare out the window all day. This is a contrast to the dogs who are trying to be productive and work for the company, implying that the cat is a bad leader.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
