Of course, this is absurd, because banana peels do not bruises (they are often used as a comedic prop for someone slipping on them).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the therapist is treating the banana peel as if it is a person who is going through some tough times. The joke could be seen as a commentary on how therapy might not be helpful for some people because they are not actually talking to another person.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist's casual observation about how some people bruise easily could be applied to almost any other object in the room and still make sense. However, the fact that she is speaking to a banana peel makes the joke humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The therapist is saying that the banana peel is right, some of us (humans) do bruise easier than others. However, the therapist is also saying that the banana peel is right in the sense that some of us (bananas) do bruise easier than others. So, the joke is making fun of both the therapist for talking to a banana peel, and the banana peel for being bruises easily.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the psychiatrist is talking to the banana as if it were a patient. This implies that the banana is bruise easily, which is a common trait of the fruit. The psychiatrist is trying to empathize with the banana, but the joke is that she is actually empathizing with a piece of fruit.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is saying that the banana peel, which is an inanimate object, is sensitive and bruising easily. This is a play on the fact that people often go to therapy to deal with sensitive issues that they might not want to talk about with other people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the idea of a therapist talking to a banana peel is absurd. The therapist is trying to act serious and professional, but the joke is that she's wasting her time because the banana peel cannot talk back or understand what she's saying.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is playing off of the banana peel's appearance to be a bruised patient. The skin of a banana peel is often bruised, and this is usually an indicator that the banana inside is no longer fresh. However, the banana peel is not a person and does not feel pain, so the therapist's comment does not make sense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is trying to empathize with the banana peel, and in doing so, she highlights the fact that she is talking to an inanimate object. This is humorous because it's a ridiculous situation: a therapist taking notes while speaking to a banana peel as if it were a real patient.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is trying to normalize the fact that a banana peel is there by saying that some people bruise easier than others. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the therapist is using the word "bruise" in the literal sense (as in, a bruise on the skin) but also in the figurative sense (as in, an emotional wound).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the banana peel is the therapist's patient, and the therapist is trying to empathize with the peel by saying that some people bruise more easily than others. This is amusing because, obviously, the banana peel is not a person, and so it cannot bruise.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the psychiatrist is talking to the banana as if it were her patient. The obvious implication is that the banana is currently bruised, and the psychiatrist is trying to console it. The joke is clever because it plays with the idea of a banana being a phallic symbol: the bruise could be seen as a metaphor for sexual assault/trauma.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is trying to treat the banana peel as if it were a human patient, but the banana peel obviously cannot understand or respond to the therapist. The therapist's comment about some of us bruising easier than others is a common saying that is often used to sympathize with someone who has been hurt emotionally, but in this context, it is absurd because the therapist is talking to a fruit.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist's comment could be taken two ways: either she is referring to the fact that some people's skin bruises more easily than others, or she is referring to the fact that some people's feelings are easily hurt, or that they are more sensitive. The latter interpretation is funnier because it's unexpected in the context of a therapist's office, where you would expect the focus to be on emotional healing, not on physical bruise healing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is treating the banana peel as if it were a human patient, but the banana peel cannot talk or understand what the therapist is saying. The joke is clever because it uses the double-meaning of the word "bruise": in the context of therapy, a "bruise" would refer to an injury or mark on the body, but in the context of a fruit, a "bruise" is a darkened spot on the skin caused by damage.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="94.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="96.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
