The woman looking back at Jack is surprised to see him there, and the man giving the presentation says that growth has exceeded their projections. The word "growth" can refer to both the physical growth of the beanstalk (i.e., Jack climbing it) and the growth of their company (i.e., the meeting).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the chart is presenting to the board about the company's growth, and Jack is (literally) a giant growth that has exceeded their projections. The woman looking back at Jack implies that she sees him, but the rest of the board is unaware of his presence, making the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the suit is presenting a chart that says "Growth has exceeded our projections" while, in the background, Jack is climbing a giant beanstalk. The joke is clever because, of course, the growth projections would be exceeded if a giant beanstalk was growing in the background!</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="94.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="96.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
