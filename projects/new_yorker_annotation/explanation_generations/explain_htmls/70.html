"Ye olde" is how you would say "the old" in a medieval accent, and "stimulus package" is a term for a government program that is meant to infuse money into the economy. The joke is clever because it ties together two very different time periods and economic systems in a way that is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The medieval soldiers are "stimulating" the economy by giving money to the peasants, but the joke is that they are doing so in a very old-fashioned way, by literally throwing money down from the castle.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's anachronistic. The courtiers are using modern language to describe a medieval event. The idea of a stimulus package is also out of place in this time period and context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The courtiers are watching as the king distributes money to the peasants, which is something that would typically happen in a stimulus package. However, the twist is that the money is being distributed in a very old-fashioned way, using baskets of dollar bills instead of more modern methods.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The scene is of a medieval king throwing money from a parapet to peasants below, and the joke is that it looks like a modern day stimulus package, in which the government gives money to people to encourage spending and jump start the economy. The joke is funny because it's an anachronism:stimulus packages are a modern day invention, but in the scene, it's being applied to a medieval setting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Ye olde" is often used to refer to things that are old-fashioned or outdated, and a stimulus package is a type of economic aid that is given out by a government. In this case, the joke is referring to the outdated practice of giving out money to peasants, as well as the fact that the money being given out is in the form of dollar bills, which would not have been used in the medieval period.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "stimulus" in this context refers to the economic stimulus package that was enacted by the Obama administration in 2009 in response to the Great Recession. However, the word "stimulus" can also mean "something that excites or motivates." In this case, the "stimulus package" is exciting or motivating the peasants below, who are presumably very pleased to be receiving free money.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "ye olde stimulus package" is a pun on the phrase "ye olde [something]," which is often used to refer to things that are old-fashioned or out-of-date. In this case, the joke is that the stimulus package (i.e., the redistribution of wealth) is old-fashioned, or that it's been done before.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The king's men are literally throwing money down to the peasants, which is something that rulers often do figuratively speaking (i.e., through policies like subsidies or handouts) in order to stay in power. In this case, the king is being more literal than usual, and the joke pokes fun at the idea that this sort of act is more common than one might think.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the anachronism of the dollar bills. It's also funny because it's a play on words: "ye olde stimulus package" is a pun on "ye olde stimulus package," which is a reference to the economic stimulus package that was passed by the U.S. Congress in 2009.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's anachronistic to have a stimulus package in the medieval period. A stimulus package is typically a government initiative to spur economic activity, usually through direct payments to citizens. This would be confused with the historical redistribution of wealth from the feudal system, where the king owned all the land and the peasants worked it in exchange for a portion of the crops.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "ye olde stimulus package" is a pun on the phrase "ye olde [noun]," which is used to describe something that is old or of a time gone by. The joke is clever because it's both a play on words and a commentary on the anachronism of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Ye olde stimulus package" is a pun on "ye olde," which is often used to give something an antique feel, and "stimulus package," which is a common term for a government program designed to spur economic growth. In this case, the stimulus package is literal, in the form of money raining down from the castle, and the joke is that this is not a particularly effective way to stimulate the economy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Ye olde stimulus package" is a pun on the "ye olde" medieval sounding phrase and the modern day term "stimulus package", which is a government program designed to inject money into the economy to boost spending. In this case, the king is doing a direct stimulus package by handing out money to the people, which is anachronistic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the word "stimulus." In modern times, stimulus refers to a government program aimed at jump-starting the economy by pumping money into it. However, the word "stimulus" can also refer to something that excites or arouses emotions or sensations. In this case, the courtiers are excited by the prospect of the king giving money to the peasants, which will arouse the emotions of the peasants.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="69.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="71.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
