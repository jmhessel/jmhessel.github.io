However, in this case, the two people are sitting in the middle of a wasteland, suggesting that they are the only two people left in the world. The woman's statement thus takes on a new, more literal meaning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is saying that she wants to "see other people," which is a common phrase used when people want to break up with their significant others. In this context, the phrase takes on a new meaning: she wants to "see other people" because there are literally no other people around, just the two of them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is saying that she wants to date other people, even though they are currently in the middle of a wasteland. The man is probably her current partner, and she is telling him that she wants to break up with him. The joke is funny because, in a typical breakup situation, people would want to be as far away from their ex as possible, but in this case, there is nowhere to go.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man and woman are in the middle of a city that has been bombed and is in ruins, and yet, the man says that he wants to "see other people," as if there are plenty of other people around to see. This is absurd because it's clear that there are no other people around, and the man's statement is a non sequitur.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "I'd like to see other people" is often used as a way of breaking up with someone; in this context, the speaker is literally saying that he wants to see other people, i.e., other survivors of the disaster.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a apocalypse-type situation, you would expect people to be desperate to find other survivors, and yet this man says he wants to see other people, which could be interpreted as meaning that he wants to date around. The woman's reaction implies that she interprets his statement in this way, and is not pleased. The joke is clever because it can be interpreted in multiple ways.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people are sitting on a bench in the middle of a destroyed city, implying that they have been through a lot together. The man then says he wants to see other people, which could mean either that he wants to date other people or that he wants to see if there are any other survivors. In either case, the joke is humorous because it's a non-sequitur in the context of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man and woman are in the middle of a destroyed city, and yet they are still concerned with the typical problems people face in relationships, namely, that one person wants to see other people. The joke is funny because it highlights the absurdity of the situation: the couple is surrounded by destruction, but they are still worried about the same things as people in more mundane circumstances.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur. In the context of a relationship falling apart, the man saying he wants to "see other people" is a common way of saying he wants to break up. However, in the context of the city being destroyed, the man saying this is absurd because there are no other people around, only the two of them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is an old dad joke. The woman says she wants to see other people, meaning she wants to date or sleep with other people, and the man misinterprets this to mean that she wants to see other people, as in, meet more people. This is a play on words because the two phrases sound similar but have different meanings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a classic line that someone says when they want to break up with their significant other. The line is usually said in a more mundane setting, like in an office or in a living room, but in this case, the setting is a wasteland. The joke is made even funnier by the fact that the two people are just sitting on some stones in the middle of nowhere; there are no other people around for them to see.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of a relationship, "seeing other people" is usually a euphemism for having an affair or breaking up. However, in this case, the man literally wants to see other people --- specifically, other people who are not his current companion. The joke is funnier if you imagine that the man is bored with the woman he's with and is looking for an excuse to leave.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is telling the man that she wants to "see other people." In a normal situation, this would mean that she wants to date other people, but in this context it probably means that she wants to see if there are any other people still alive in this bombed-out city. The man's reaction of getting angry is funny because it's a typical reaction to someone wanting to date other people, but in this context it's misplaced.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a very common phrase people use when they want to break up with their significant other, but the setting makes it seem much more dramatic. In this scene, the man and woman are sitting in the middle of a wasteland, which could be the aftermath of a war or some other disaster. The phrase takes on a whole new meaning in this context, as the man and woman are likely the only other people around for miles.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is saying that she wants to see other people, meaning she wants to date or have sex with other people, even though they are in the middle of a wasteland where there are no other people. This illustrates the absurd idea that even if there were only two people in the world, one of them would still want to date or have sex with someone else.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="69.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="71.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
