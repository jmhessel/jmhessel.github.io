They're billing by the hour.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it points out the absurdity of billing by the hour when you are being followed by someone. If you are being followed, it doesn't matter how fast you go, they are still going to follow you. In this case, the men on the horses are being followed by the businessmen, who are seemingly being paid by the hour, regardless of how fast the men go.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the presence of the men in suits suggests that they are businessmen, who are used to working at a fast pace. However, the men on horses are travelling at a leisurely pace, probably because they are on vacation. The businessmen are not happy with this because they are paying by the hour, and they want to get back to work as soon as possible.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men on horseback are from a time when billing by the hour did not exist. The joke suggests that the men in suits are rushing the men on horseback so they can get back to their office and bill their client for their time. The humor comes from the incongruity of the two groups: the men on horseback are from a time when billing by the hour was not the norm, so the joke highlights the absurdity of trying to hurry them along.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men in suits are from a modern, fast-paced business world, while the men on horses are from a more slow-paced, traditional world. The men in suits are clearly out of place, yet they are still billing by the hour, as if they are in a hurry. The joke highlights the absurdity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the soldiers are being followed by businessmen, who are presumably billing them by the hour. This means that the faster the soldiers go, the more money the businessmen make. The joke is clever because it's a play on the phrase "pick up the pace," which usually means to go faster, but in this context, it has a double meaning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a sequence of events that doesn't make a lot of sense. It is strange that the businessmen would be following the soldiers, and even stranger that they would be billing them by the hour. This joke highlights the absurdity of the situation by pointing out that the only thing that makes sense is that they are billing the soldiers by the hour.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "pick up the pace" is often used to encourage people to move faster. In this case, the soldiers are telling the businessmen to move faster because they are being charged by the hour. This is a play on the fact that many businesses charge by the hour for consulting or other services.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The businessmen are behind the soldiers, but they are also billing the soldiers for their time. Therefore, the soldiers need to pick up the pace so that they can finish their mission and get back to the office.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men on the horses are soldiers, who are typically associated with bravery and being willing to fight and die for their country. In contrast, the businessmen who are following them are only concerned about money, and so they want the soldiers to hurry up so that they can get back to their office and bill for their time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The men in suits are billing by the hour, meaning they are being paid by the hour, but the men on horses are actual bills, meaning money. The men in suits want to pick up the pace because they want to get paid more money, but the men on horses are the actual bills, so picking up the pace would mean going faster, which is not what the men in suits want.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the soldiers might be billing by the hour, it's more likely that the businessmen are, since they are the ones who are being hired to follow behind the soldiers. The soldiers are probably just trying to get to their destination as quickly as possible, but the businessmen are being paid by the hour, so they are in no rush. This incongruity is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's incongruous to see men in suits and ties being billed by the hour by men on horseback in armor. The men in suits are probably businessmen from a modern era, while the men on horseback are from a more historical era. The idea that the two groups are in the same place and time is funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Picking up the pace" can mean either to move faster physically or to hurry up and finish the task at hand. In this case, the businessmen are hurrying the soldiers along because they are being charged by the hour. The fact that the businessmen are out of place in this scene (on horseback in a war zone) adds to the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "to bill by the hour," which is common for lawyers and other professionals. Here, the joke is that the soldiers are being followed by businessmen who are billing them by the hour, presumably for some sort of consulting services. The joke is clever because it makes a pun on the phrase "to bill by the hour."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The men in suits are billing the men on horses by the hour, which is a ridiculously anachronistic thing to do. The men on horses are probably being chased by the men in suits, and so the joke is that the men in suits are in a hurry to catch them so that they can keep racking up the bill.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
