The wheel is a invention that is often cited as being one of the most important inventions in history. However, the wheel can't be invented if there is no concept of a wheel. In this situation, the caveman is seeing a lizard drawn a picture, something that presumably requires opposable thumbs, and comments that the lizard probably didn't invent the wheel either. This is ironic because, of course, the wheel was invented by humans, not lizards.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's impossible for the lizard to have invented the wheel, because he doesn't have opposable thumbs. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the question "Did you invent the wheel?" can mean both "Did you come up with this idea?" and "Are you capable of doing this?" and the answer to both questions is "No."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "wheel" being referred to is not the literal object, but rather, the saying "reinventing the wheel", which means creating something that already exists in a new or different way. In this case, the caveman is surprised that the reptile didn't invent the wheel because, well, reptiles don't have opposable thumbs and thus couldn't have invented the wheel.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The first part of the joke is a comment on the fact that the lizard is doing something that it's not evolutionarily possible for it to do. The second part of the joke is a comment on the fact that the wheel is one of the most important inventions in human history, and cavemen are often associated with being primitive. So, the joke is cleverly poking fun at both the lizard and the cavemen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the cavemen are not happy because the reptile is doing something they consider to be artsy and hippy, but because the reptile is doing something that they think is pointless and not useful, like inventing the wheel.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The first meaning is that the speaker is surprised that the lizard is drawings, and says "let me guess, you didn't invent the wheel either," meaning that he didn't think the lizard was capable of such a feat. The second meaning is that, since the lizard didn't invent the wheel, the cavemen who are watching him must not have either, which is a clever way of saying that they are Neanderthals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is making a sarcastic comment about the reptile's intelligence. The punchline is that, of course, the reptile didn't invent the wheel --- because reptiles don't have opposable thumbs and thus couldn't have invented one of the most important human inventions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's based on the stereotype that cavemen were uneducated and not very bright. The man is saying that, since the lizard didn't invent the wheel (a common invention that is considered to be a sign of intelligence), he likely isn't very smart. The joke is clever because it takes a stereotype and uses it to make a point about another topic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The cavemen are upset because they didn't invent cave painting, but the speaker is actually talking about the wheel, which is a more significant invention. The speaker is implying that the cavemen are not very creative or innovative, which is why they are upset about not inventing cave painting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is clever wordplay. The wheel is a common invention that is often considered one of the keystone inventions of civilization. The joke implies that, just as the lizard didn't invent the wheel, he also didn't invent cave paintings. This is clever because, of course, the lizard didn't invent the wheel because he is a lizard, and not a human. Similarly, the lizard didn't invent cave paintings because he can't paint --- he doesn't have opposable thumbs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the reptile is not as clever as the cavemen because it didn't invent the wheel. However, the cavemen didn't invent the wheel either, which is implied by the fact that they are using prehistoric means to try and catch the reptile.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The caveman did not invent the wheel, but he did invent the hieroglyph, which is a type of early writing. The joke is clever because it is a way of saying that the caveman is not very bright, even though he did invent something.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The first part of the joke is a common expression used when someone says something that is not true. In this case, the person is saying that the lizard didn't invent the wheel, even though it is clear that the lizard is drawing a picture. The second part of the joke is that the lizard didn't actually invent the wheel, because lizards don't have opposable thumbs and can't make wheels.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at the stereotype that cavemen were stupid and didn't invent anything. The joke suggests that, if the cavemen saw the lizard drawing, they might not be impressed because they would think that the lizard didn't invent the wheel either, another popular caveman stereotype.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is surprised that the lizard is drawing on the wall, when in reality, it should be the other way around. The caveman is inferring that, since the lizard didn't invent the wheel, it must not be as intelligent as he is. However, the lizard is actually doing something that the caveman can't do, which is use its opposable thumbs to create art.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="195.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="197.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
