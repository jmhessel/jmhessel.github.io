The man has an "IN" sign and the woman has an "OUT" sign, which is the opposite of what would be expected. This implies that the man is trying to get a job (by going "IN" to the office), while the woman is trying to leave her job (by going "OUT" of the office). The joke is clever because it also works if the signs are reversed, which would imply that the woman is trying to get a job and the man is trying to leave his job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The " IN " sign is usually associated with "incoming," as in, someone who is coming into the office. The " OUT " sign is usually associated with "outgoing," as in, someone who is leaving the office.
