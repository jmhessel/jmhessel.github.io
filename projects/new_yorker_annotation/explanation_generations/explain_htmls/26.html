The bet implies that the person who thinks the plant will mention sustainable growth is confident that the plant will do so because it is a popular buzzword among CEOs. The joke is clever because it is true --- many CEOs do talk about sustainable growth --- but the plant cannot actually say anything, making the bet humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the plant is a metaphor for the CEO, who is not present. The joke is that the CEO is so uninvolved in the company that he might as well be a plant, and that the only time he would be relevant is if he mentioned the buzzword "sustainable growth." The joke is also funny because it's true --- many CEOs are more concerned with growth than sustainability, and may not even know what sustainable growth means.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the protagonist is making a bet that the plant will say something that is often said by CEOs during business meetings. The joke works because it is unlikely for a plant to be in a meeting, let alone be the CEO, so the protagonist is most likely to win the bet.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="25.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="27.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
