If a human said this, it would be a standard set-up for a joke where the punchline would be the husband getting rid of his wife. However, since a bear said it, the joke becomes absurd. This is made even funnier by the fact that the bear is in a river, which is where fish live. So the bear is effectively telling the fish to take his wife, which makes no sense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the salmon are in a predicament where they are about to be eaten by the bear, and the bear is asking them to take his wife instead. The joke is a play on the common phrase "take my wife, please," which is often said when a man is joking about how much he wishes he could get rid of his wife.

In the context of the joke, the salmon are saying this to the bear because they would rather the bear take their wives (and eat them) than eat them themselves.

The standard phrase is "take my wife, please", which is a way of saying "my wife is so annoying, please take her away from me".
