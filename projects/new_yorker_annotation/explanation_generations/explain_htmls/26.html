The "delusions" that the person on the horse is referring to is the delusion that the other guy is actually sitting on a horse. In reality, there is no horse, which makes the situation comical.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man on the "horse" is delusional, because he thinks he's riding a horse, when in reality, he's just sitting on a saddle in the middle of the desert. The man on the actual horse is surprised because he's realized that the other man is delusional.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cowboy is pointing out the absurdity of the other cowboy's delusion: the other cowboy is clearly fantasizing about being a cowboy, since he is not actually sitting on a horse, but is instead just sitting on a saddle in midair. By contrast, the first cowboy is a real cowboy, who is not being carried along by any delusions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the horse is surprised to see that the other man's horse is invisible. This is probably because the man on the horse is delusional, and he's only seeing what he wants to see. The fact that he's being carried along by his delusions is ironic, because it's usually horses that carry people, not the other way around.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cowboy talking is delusional: he believes he's riding a horse, even though he's just floating in the air. It's a delusion that allows him to keep going, even though he's not actually going anywhere.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cowboy is talking to another cowboy who is, apparently, not visible to him. The cowboy is saying that, in the end, we're all carried along by our delusions, i.e., things that we believe that aren't true. In this case, the other cowboy's delusion is that he is invisible, when he is actually just hanging in the air.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The cowboy is talking about how he's being "carried along" by his horse, but "carried along" can also mean to be deceived by something. In this case, the cowboy is deluded into thinking he's riding his horse, when in reality, he's just floating in the air.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the cowboy is talking about the fact that the other cowboy is, literally, being carried along by his delusions, as in, he is not really on a horse, despite what he believes. The joke is also funny because it's a comment on the human condition: we are all, to some extent, carried along by our delusions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Carrying someone along" can mean to support them emotionally or to physically transport them. In this case, the cowboy is being transported by his delusion, i.e., the imaginary horse he's sitting on. The other cowboy's comment implies that he sees through the delusion and knows there is no horse, but is still going along with it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is true. Cowboy culture is very into the idea of a "cowboy code" and living life a certain way. However, the cowboy who is speaking to Ed is pointing out that, in reality, most people are just along for the ride, not really in control, and that cowboy culture is just a delusion. The joke is even funnier because the situation the cowboy is in, being on an invisible horse, is itself a delusion.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Ed, the man on the saddle, is delusional if he thinks there is an invisible horse underneath him. The joke also pokes fun at the stereotype of cowboys being simple-minded.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's true: the man on the horse is only being carried by the horse because he believes that the horse is there. The man on the saddle is also being carried by his delusions, except he doesn't realize it. The difference between the two men is that the man on the horse is being carried by a real horse, while the man on the saddle is being carried by an invisible horse.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the men is sitting on an invisible horse, which is a clear delusion. The man on the visible horse is pointing this out to the other man, saying that in a way, we are all held up by our delusions, or things that we believe in that may not be true.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the cowboys is delusionally thinking that he is riding his horse, when in reality he is just floating in the air. The other cowboy is pointing out the delusion, but also saying that we all have them, which is a reference to the saying "we all have our own little delusions that we live in."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The cowboy on the horse is talking to the cowboy on the invisible saddle, and he says "In the end, Ed, most of us are carried along by our delusions." The word "delusions" can mean either a false belief or an illusion. In this case, the cowboy on the horse is saying that the cowboy on the invisible saddle is delusional because he thinks he's on a horse when he's really not. The cowboy on the horse is also saying that he's delusional because he believes he's a cowboy when he's really just a man in a cowboy costume.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
