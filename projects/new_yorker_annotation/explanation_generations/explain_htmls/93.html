The cowboy is talking about how he likes the smell of a new horse, but since the other cowboy is on a mechanical horse, the joke is that he actually smells like metal and oil, not like a real horse.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the horse is not really new, it's just mechanical. The cowboy is naively treating it like it's a new horse, when in fact it's just a machine. The joke is clever because it uses the phrase "smell of a new horse," which is usually used to describe the pleasant smell of a real horse, to instead describe the metal smell of a machine.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cowboy is talking about the smell of a new horse, but there is nothing new about the mechanical horse-- it's just a machine. So, the cowboy must be talking about the smell of the desert, which is not pleasant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the mechanical horse can't smell, the cowboy's comment implies that he can, and thus, is enjoying the smell of the new horse. This is ironic because, not only can the horse not smell, but it's not even real.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The smell of a new horse is actually a reference to the smell of a new car. However, because the horse in the scene is a robot, the joke takes on a new meaning. The joke is clever because it is a play on words that is also a comment on the scene.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The cowboy is talking about how he likes the smell of a new horse, but because the horse is mechanical, it doesn't actually have a smell.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the horses is mechanical, and thus doesn't have a real horse smell. The cowboy's comment about the smell of the new horse is ironic because there is no smell.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "Nothin' like the smell of a new horse" is usually said to describe the smell of a real horse. However, in this case, because the horse is mechanical, it doesn't actually have a smell. So, the cowboy is making a joke about how the horse doesn't smell like anything.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the cowboy's horses is a robot, so it doesn't actually smell like a horse. The joke relies on the word play of the word "smell" which can mean both the olfactory experience, or an expression meaning something is suspicious. In this case, the cowboy's comment about smelling a new horse is really him saying that something doesn't feel right, which is ironic because the reason something doesn't feel right is because he is sitting on top of a robot horse.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the mechanical horse cannot smell. The cowboy is either ignoring this fact, or he's deliberately being obtuse.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity between the horse on the right being a robot, and the cowboy's comment about the smell of a new horse. The cowboy is either oblivious to the fact that the horse is a robot, or is trying to ignore it, which is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The cowboy on the real horse is saying that he enjoys the smell of a new horse, which is normal. However, the cowboy on the mechanical horse is not really a horse, so the fact that he enjoys the smell of a new horse is strange.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. When the cowboy says "Nothin' like the smell of a new horse," he is actually talking about the smell of the new mechanical horse. This is confusing because, to a person who doesn't know about mechanical horses, it would just sound like he is talking about a regular horse.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the mechanical horse doesn't smell like a real horse. This is a play on words, because when you say "something smells new," it usually means that it smells good. However, in this case, the horse smells new because it's not a real horse.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
