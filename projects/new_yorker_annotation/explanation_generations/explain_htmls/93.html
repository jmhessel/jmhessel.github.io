The pig is angry because he is receiving these emails even though he didn't sign up for them, and he wants them to stop. This is ironic because pigs are often associated with being dirty and eating garbage, so the idea of a pig getting spam emails is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is unexpected for a pig to be using a computer and email, let alone to be complaining about spam. This is a play on the stereotype that older people or those not familiar with technology are unable to use it properly, and thus are more likely to be spammed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the pig is upset about receiving spam emails, which are a common annoyance. The pig is talking to the customer service representative as if she is responsible for the spam emails, and demands that they stop. The joke is also funny because it's unexpected to see a pig talking and acting like a human.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="92.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="94.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
