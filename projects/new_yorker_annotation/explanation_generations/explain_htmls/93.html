However, in this case, the therapist is asking the banana peel whether it feels like it could be a danger to others. This is silly because banana peels are not sentient and thus cannot pose a danger to others.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is asking a serious question to the banana peel, as if it were a human patient. The question is significant because a banana peel, while not dangerous to most people, can cause someone to slip and fall, which might be considered a danger to others. However, the idea of a banana peel needing therapy is also funny in and of itself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is asking a banana peel if it feels like it could be a danger to others. This is silly because banana peels are not sentient beings and therefore cannot answer the question. However, the therapist is possibly asking the question because she's never seen a banana peel in her office before and is wondering why it's there.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is asking a banana peel if it feels like it could be a danger to others. The banana peel, of course, can't answer, which makes the therapist's question pointless. However, the therapist's serious tone and the fact that she is taking notes makes the joke funnier because it implies that she takes her job very seriously, even when her client is a inanimate object.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is treating the Banana Peel as if it were a human patient. The therapist is asking a common question that Psychiatrists ask their patients, but in this case it is ridiculous because the Banana Peel cannot answer and pose no threat to anyone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a banana peel, being an inanimate object, cannot hurt anyone. The therapist is asking a question that she knows is ridiculous, but is trying to maintain a serious facade. The joke is a play on the common therapist question, "Do you feel like you could hurt yourself or others?" which is meant to gauge whether the patient is a suicide risk or might harm someone else.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is treating the banana peel as if it were a human patient. The banana peel does not need therapy and is not a danger to others, so the therapist's question is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is asking a banana peel whether it feels like it could be a danger to others. The banana peel, of course, cannot answer, so the therapist is essentially talking to herself. The joke is clever because it takes a common type of question that therapists ask their patients (i.e., whether they feel like they could be a danger to others) and applies it to an inanimate object, something that would never need therapy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is talking to a banana peel as if it were a human patient. The banana peel is not dangerous to others, but the therapist is asking a standard question that she would ask a human patient. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the word "danger" can refer to both the physical act of being dangerous and the emotional state of feeling danger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the banana peel is not a sentient being and, therefore, cannot answer the therapist's question. The therapist is asking a question that she would typically ask to a patient, but the fact that the patient is a banana peel makes the question absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is talking to the banana peel as if it is a patient. The banana peel is not capable of responding, which makes the therapist's question moot. Furthermore, the question itself is humorous because it is a common question that therapists ask patients, but in this context, it is applied to a inanimate object.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because therapists often have to ask their patients if they are a danger to themselves or others, but in this case, the therapist is asking the banana peel. The banana peel, of course, cannot answer, and the therapist is left to assume that the answer is "yes."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the therapist's serious tone and the absurdity of the client: therapist's are required to ask if their clients pose a danger to themselves or others, but in this case, the client is a banana peel and poses no danger to anyone. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: "danger" can refer to the physical danger posed by someone who is, e.g., suicidal or homicidal, but it can also refer to the danger of slipping on a banana peel, which is what banana peels are actually for.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is treating the banana peel as if it were a patient. The banana peel, of course, cannot speak or answer questions, so the therapist is asking questions that would normally be relevant to a human patient. In this case, the therapist is asking if the banana peel could be a danger to others, which is a question that would normally be relevant to a human patient with mental health issues, but is hilarious when asked of a banana peel.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is asking a standard question to her patient, but the patient is a Banana Peel. The Banana Peel cannot answer the question, which is ironic, because the therapist is asking if the Banana Peel could hurt other people, and the Banana Peel cannot speak or move.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="92.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="94.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
