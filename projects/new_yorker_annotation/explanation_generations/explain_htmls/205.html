The situation might be a trap, in the sense that the huge amount of cheese might be bait to lure in rodents so they can be killed. But, the mouse is so big that it could easily turn the tables and eat the executives instead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "trap" can be both a noun and a verb. In this case, the mouse is literally in a trap (a device used to capture animals), but he's also in a metaphorical trap (a situation that is difficult to escape from). The other meaning of "trap" is important because it's a homophone of the word "tripe," which means "nonsense." So, the joke is also saying that the entire meeting is a trap, or, in other words, it's nonsense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Is this a trap?" could mean two things: first, it could be a question about the situation, as in, "Is this a trap that the mouse has set for us?" Second, it could be a more general question, as in, "Is this a trap that we're in, meaning, is this a bad situation?" The ambiguity is funny because it's unclear which meaning the speaker is intending.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "Is this a trap?" can mean two things: 1) is this a trap set up to catch someone, and 2) is this a trap that someone could fall into. In this case, the giant mouse and the cheese represent a trap set up to catch rats, but it's also a trap that someone could fall into if they're not careful.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Is this a trap?" could mean two things: 1) Is this a business trap, i.e., a scheme to swindle someone? or 2) Is this a mouse trap, i.e., a device used to catch mice? The word "trap" can have multiple meanings, and in this context, the two meanings are juxtaposed to create a pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the mouse is attending a business meeting, and he is worried that the other people in the meeting might be trying to trap him. This is a play on words because "trap" can mean two things: a physical trap, or a situation in which someone is tricked or lured into something. In this case, the mouse is worried that the meeting is a trap in the sense that the other people might be trying to trick him or lure him into something.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "Is this a trap?" can mean two things: first, it can be a genuine question about whether the situation is a trap, i.e., whether the giant mouse is going to attack. Second, it can be a metaphor for whether the situation is a professional "trap" --- meaning, is this a bad business decision that will come back to bite us later. In this case, it's probably both: the mouse is probably going to attack, and it's probably a bad business decision.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the businessmouse is addressing the fact that the giant piece of cheese in the middle of the room might be a trap, and he reassures the others that it's not. The fact that he is a mouse and the cheese is also bait for a trap makes the joke funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the mouse is in a meeting with other (human) business people, and he is addressing the fact that he knows that they are wondering if this is a trap. He is saying that he knows they are thinking this because he is a mouse, and mice are often associated with being caught in traps. However, he is also a business person, which is a role that is not typically associated with mice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "trap" can mean two things: first, it can be a device used to capture rodents like rats, and second, it can be a dangerous or deceptive situation. The executives in the scene are in a dangerous and deceptive situation (hence why they have a giant rat in front of them), but they are also literally in a trap, since it's a trap set to capture the rat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "trap" can mean both a trap for catching animals, and a trap as in a difficult situation. The giant mouse might be thinking that the executives are setting a trap for him, by luring him in with cheese. Alternatively, the executives might be thinking that the mouse is setting a trap for them, by luring them in with the promise of cheese and then stealing it. In either case, it's a funny play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the mouse is attending a business meeting, and given that mice are often associated with being pests, the other attendees might be wondering if the mouse is there to sabotage the meeting in some way. The mouse, sensing the suspicion, tries to assure them that he is not there to cause any trouble.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The speaker is referring to the phrase "Is this a trap?", which might be said by someone when they are worried they are going to be tricked or caught in a difficult situation. However, the fact that there is an actual mouse in the room dressed in a suit suggests that the phrase "Is this a trap?" could be literal, i.e., the mouse is worried about being caught in a trap set by one of the people in the room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the mouse is caught in a literal trap (a trap designed to catch mice), but the other business people in the room thought the mouse was referring to a "trap" as in a business deal that's too good to be true. The joke is amusing because the mouse is probably the only one in the room who is actually aware of the literal trap he's in.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The mouse is dressed in a suit, just like the other business-people at the meeting, which might make someone think he is a member of the company. However, the word "trap" can also mean a device used to capture rodents, which is what a mouse is. Therefore, the joke is that the mouse is both a member of the company and a potential target for capture.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
