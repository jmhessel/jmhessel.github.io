In this case, the revolution has already begun, and it's happening in the office, with the workman on the phone in the suit, and the man in the suit washing the windows. This is a reversal of the traditional roles of these two types of people, and it's implied that this is the beginning of a larger revolution.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "revolution" can mean two things: 1) a political overthrow of a government and 2) a rotation or turn. In this case, the man on the phone is saying that the revolution (the political overthrow) has begun, while the man on the scaffold is saying that the revolution (the turn or rotation) has begun. The word play is clever and funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the phrase "the revolution will not be televised." In this scene, the roles of the business person and the window washer have been reversed, which could be seen as a small-scale revolution.
