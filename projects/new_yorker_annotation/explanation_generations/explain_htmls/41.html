The waiter is apologizing for the long wait, but instead of saying that the restaurant has been busy, he says that it's been like Grand Central Station. Grand Central Station is a place where trains come and go, so it's a place where people are constantly coming and going. In other words, the waiter is saying that the restaurant has been so busy that it's been like a train station.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The waiter is apologizing for the wait, but at the same time, he is also making a pun on the fact that there are a lot of people at the subway station. The waiter's comment is clever because it is true in both a literal and figurative sense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The waiter is apologizing for the long wait time for the food, but makes a pun on the fact that there is an actual train station in the restaurant. This is humorous because it is an unexpected and clever use of language.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The waiter is apologizing for the long wait, but instead of saying that the restaurant has been busy, he says that it's been like Grand Central Station. Grand Central Station is a place where people catch trains, so the joke is that the waiter is saying that the restaurant has been so busy that it's been like a place where people are constantly coming and going.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter is apologizing for the wait time to the diners, but instead of using a more normal metaphor like "it's been crazy busy", he says "it's been like Grand Central Station in here". This is funny because it's a very specific and strange comparison, and also because it's not true in the literal sense: there is no train coming through the restaurant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The waiter is apologizing for the wait, saying that it's been really busy, like Grand Central Station. But in this case, the wait is not for a train, but for the food they ordered at the restaurant, which is also located in a Subway station.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is apologizing for the wait, but he is also saying that the wait is due to the high volume of people coming through the subway station. This is a play on words because the term "Grand Central Station" is used to describe a very busy place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter is apologizing for the wait, but in his apology, he's emphasizing how busy it's been, which is the very reason for the wait in the first place. It's a silly, circular apology.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter is apologetic for the wait time to the customers at the table, but makes a comparison to the Grand Central Station, a very busy place, to explain why the wait is so long. This is humorous because it is a non-sequitur: the waiter could have just as easily said "I'm sorry for the wait, we've been very busy," without the comparison to the train station.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter is apologizing for the wait, but his excuse is that the restaurant is too popular and busy, like Grand Central Station. This is ironic because, in actuality, the restaurant is empty and the only customers are the two people sitting at the table.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the use of the idiom "like Grand Central Station." The idiom is used to describe a place that is very busy and has a lot of foot traffic. In this case, the waiter is using the idiom to describe how busy the subway station has been, which is unusual because people generally don't dine at subway stations.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a common cliche for a waiter to say "sorry for the wait" to customers, even though it's not really the waiter's fault. In this case, the waiter is using the cliche in a more literal sense: the subway station has been so crowded that it's been like Grand Central Station, one of the busiest train stations in the world. The joke is clever because it's a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter is making a light-hearted joke about how busy the subway station is, comparing it to Grand Central Station. However, the joke is also funny because it is a play on words: the waiter is actually referring to the fact that there has been a lot of people coming and going from the subway station, and not to the physical structure of Grand Central Station.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter is apologizing for the wait, but instead compares the wait to something else that is known for being a place with a lot of people coming and going: Grand Central Station. The joke is clever because it's true --- there are a lot of people coming and going in a subway station, so the comparison makes sense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter is apologizing for the long wait, but in reality, the wait hasn't been long at all because the restaurant is in a subway station and people are coming and going all the time. The waiter is accidentally saying that the restaurant is very popular, when in reality, it's just because of the foot traffic in the subway.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
