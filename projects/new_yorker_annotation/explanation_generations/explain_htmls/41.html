The man stabbed in the back with a knife has a "sharp" object in his back, and the theses he's holding are also "sharply worded," meaning they are critical or argumentative.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to the Reformation, a religious and political movement in 16th-century Europe. One of the main driving forces behind the Reformation was the publishing of the Ninety-five Theses, a paper written by Martin Luther that critiqued the Catholic Church. In the joke, the man who has been stabbed is referring to the paper that has been knifed to his back as being "sharply worded", a play on words between the literal meaning of the words and the Reformation context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's reaction to being stabbed in the back is oddly calm. He is casually talking on the phone as if nothing is wrong, even though he has a knife sticking out of his back. The joke is also clever because "sharply worded" is a pun on "sharp," as in the knife that is stuck in the man's back.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man has a knife in his back, and he is talking on the phone. He is describing the conversation he is having as "sharply worded". However, the word "sharply" can also mean "to cut or stab with a sharp object". So, the man is both literally and figuratively having a "sharply worded" conversation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun. The man has been stabbed in the back with a knife, and he is also holding a piece of paper with sharp words written on it. The joke is that the words on the paper are so sharp that they have literally stabbed him in the back.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has been stabbed in the back with a paper knife, which is a type of knife that is not very sharp. The man's nonchalant attitude towards being stabbed with a blunt object points to the lack of seriousness of the situation, which is contrasted with the usually severe reactions to being stabbed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is talking on the phone with a knife lodged in his back. The term "sharply worded" is often used to describe critique or rebukes that are biting or caustic; in this case, it refers both to the physical sharpness of the knife, as well as the fact that the criticism must have been severe for the other person to take such drastic action.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is literally describing his current predicament as "sharply worded." In other words, the fact that he has a knife stabbed into his back is a result of the situation he is in being "sharply worded" or full of conflict. The joke is a play on words, with the knife being a literal sharp object.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the knife in his back is using a telecommunication device, which is a modern invention, to talk to someone. This means that he is probably discussing the contents of the papers that were stabbed along with the knife; the papers are probably some kind of medieval document, such as the 95 Theses. The joke is that the man is having a discussion about a very old document using a very modern technology, which is ironic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the protagonist has been stabbed in the back with a piece of paper, most likely a letter or note of some sort. The protagonist reacts to this matter-of-factly, even understating it by describing it as "sharply worded" when in reality, it's quite a bit more serious than that.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to the fact that the man has a knife in his back, and the Knife is a sharp object. The fact that the man is on the phone and seemingly unaware of the knife in his back, makes it even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "sharply worded" is usually used to describe something like a scathing review or insulting remark. In this case, the phrase is used to describe the fact that the man has been literally stabbed in the back.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who has been stabbed is using a pun: the Ninety-Five Theses were famously nails that Martin Luther used to protest the Catholic Church, and in this situation, the man has been stabbed with a piece of paper instead. So, the man's comment that the situation is "sharply worded" is a play on words, as well as a way to downplay the seriousness of being stabbed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has been stabbed in the back, which is often considered to be a metaphor for betrayal. The fact that he is using a phone, which is a common device for communication, emphasizes the betrayal even more. The joke is clever because "sharply worded" can describe both the act of being stabbed (i.e., with a sharp object) and a heated argument (i.e., words that are spoken sharply).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who was stabbed is making a pun: he was stabbed with a dull knife, so it didn't go in very far (sharply), and the message on the paper is also a criticism or complaint (sharply worded). The fact that he is so calm about being stabbed, and that he is able to make a pun in this situation, is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="40.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="42.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
