The clowns in the car are "a short circus", meaning that there are too many clowns in the car and they're not supposed to be there. The man is telling the clown that the reason the car isn't working is because there's a short circuit, meaning that there's something wrong with the electrical system. The joke is clever because it's a double meaning that is also relevant to the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is trying to tell the clown that there are too many clowns in the car, and that's the reason why the car won't start.
