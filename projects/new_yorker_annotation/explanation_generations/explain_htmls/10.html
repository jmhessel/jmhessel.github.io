The woman is talking about how, after a while, she doesn't even see the bees anymore, they're just part of the background. But, of course, the man in the beehive is still there, and so the woman's statement takes on a new meaning: she's saying she doesn't see the man anymore, even though he's right in front of her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is talking about how, after a certain amount of time spent with the bees, she doesn't even notice them anymore. But the man hidden in the beehive is also part of the hive, so the joke is that she's effectively saying she doesn't notice him either.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is saying that, after a while of being in the beehive, she doesn't even notice the bees anymore, even though they are right there. The joke is clever because it is both a play on words and a play on the idea of being in a beehive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man's head being in the beehive is a metaphor for being so invested in something that you become blind to what's happening around you. The woman, who is staring at the man's head in the beehive, is a metaphor for someone who is trying to get the man's attention. The joke is that the man is so focused on the bees that he doesn't even notice the woman.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the play on the phrase "after a while, it's like". The woman's head in the beehive is unexpected and strange, and the man's head staring at her just amplifies the weirdness. However, the man's matter-of-fact comment suggests that, to him, this is a completely normal occurrence. The phrase "after a while" is typically used to describe how something that is unusual or strange at first becomes normal over time; in this case, the joke is implying that the man has been staring at the woman's head in the beehive for so long that it's no longer strange to him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the idiom "it's like, what, fish?" which is used to describe how something can become so commonplace that you no longer even notice it. In this case, the woman has become so used to the beehive with a human face attached to it that she doesn't even see it anymore.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "after a while, it's like water off a duck's back", meaning that something becomes so commonplace that you no longer even notice it. In this case, the bee's stings become so commonplace that the man doesn't even feel them anymore.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is staring at the man in the beehive because she's trying to find him in a game of hide-and-seek, but after a while, she becomes used to the bees and stops paying attention to them. This is similar to the idiom "after a while, it's like water off a duck's back," meaning that something that is initially bothersome becomes less so over time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a nonchalant way of acknowledging the fact that there's a man's head in a beehive. It's as if the man has become so used to the bees that they don't even register as being there anymore.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man's head is in a beehive, and he is asking the woman if she can see the bees. But, after a while, the man gets used to the bees and starts to ignore them, hence the joke "after a while it's like, what bees?"</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common phrase "After a while, it's like, what [X]?" where X is some mundane thing. In this case, the X is "bees," which are normally not something that people would become immune to. However, in this case, the woman has become so used to the bee hive attached to the tree that she doesn't even notice it anymore.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "after a while, it's like, what `blank`?", which is used to describe how something that is initially strange or different can become normalized after exposure. In this case, the joke is that, even though there is a man's head in a beehive, after a while, it's no big deal, or even something that one would forget.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the beehive is playing a game of hide-and-seek, and he's hidden so well that even the woman who is looking for him can't see him. But, after a while, the man gets bored, and starts to talk to the woman, asking her if she can see him yet. Of course, she can't, because he's hidden in the beehive. The joke is clever because it uses the word "bees" to mean both the insects that live in beehives, and the sound that a person makes when they can't see something.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the saying "After a while, the chicken crossing the road became like, what chicken?" The woman in the scene is so used to seeing a human face in the beehive that it's no longer strange or unusual to her. The joke cleverly inverts the expected scene to create a humorous effect.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "after a while, you don't even notice it anymore." In this case, the bee hive is so normal to the man that he doesn't even notice it anymore. This is a funny contrast to the woman, who is staring at the bee hive in disbelief.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="9.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="11.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
