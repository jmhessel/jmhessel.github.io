In this case, the "hidden service charge" is the fact that, by accepting the food, the castle will be letting their enemies inside the gates.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the trojan horse of food is a play on the phrase " Trojan horse." In the original story, the Trojan horse was given as a gift to the city of Troy, but it actually contained Greek soldiers who then snuck into the city and destroyed it. Here, the trojan horse of food is given as a gift, but it actually contains a hidden service charge, which is a play on the concept of a " Trojan horse."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it references the Trojan Horse, a mythical story in which the Greeks snuck into the city of Troy by hiding in a giant wooden horse. In the story, the Trojans pull the horse into their city as a gesture of goodwill, not knowing that it contains a group of Greek soldiers who subsequently open the city gates and allow the rest of the Greek army to invade. The joke is similar to the Trojan Horse story in that the seemingly innocuous table of food is actually a trick, and the "hidden service charge" is the Greeks invading the city.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it subverts the typical "beware of Greeks bearing gifts" Trojan Horse story. In this case, the Trojan Horse is not a physical object, but rather a huge table full of free food, which is itself a gift. However, the joke is that there is a hidden service charge, i.e., the free food is a trap to lure people in so that they can be charged for it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. A "service charge" is often a hidden fee that companies add on to customers' bills. In this case, the "service charge" is the Trojan Horse, which, while it may appear to be a gift, is actually a hidden army that will overtake the castle.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. When a customer receives a bill for a purchase that includes a "hidden service charge", they are often surprised and annoyed because they were not expecting to pay extra for the services rendered. In this case, the "hidden service charge" is a Trojan horse: a gift that seems innocuous, but is actually a danger. The joke is clever because it is a play on words, but it is also funny because it is a play on the expectations of the situation: instead of being a hidden cost, the Trojan horse is a hidden danger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Trojan horse was originally a wooden horse given as a gift that had soldiers hidden inside. In this situation, the Trojan horse is a literal horse made of food, so the hidden service charge is a play on words. The joke is also clever because it's true that when you order food at a restaurant, there is usually a hidden service charge, even if it's not explicitly stated.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The Trojan Horse was a gift that was actually a trap, and the word "service" can mean both a fee for a service rendered, as well as being polite, as in "servicing a customer." In this case, the "service" is the Trojan Horse being brought into the castle, and the "charge" is the army inside the horse that will attack the castle.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The "service charge" is usually a fee that is added to a bill at a restaurant. However, in this case, the "service charge" is actually a Trojan Horse, which is a hidden danger. The joke is clever because it is both a warning about the Trojan Horse and a clever way to critique the hidden fees that are often added to bills at restaurants.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the hidden service charge is usually a fee that restaurants add to your bill without telling you beforehand. In this case, the hidden service charge is a Trojan horse, which is a metaphor for something that appears innocuous but is actually harmful. In the Trojan war, the Greeks gave a huge wooden horse to their enemies, the Trojans, as a peace offering. But, inside the horse were Greek warriors, who opened the gates to the city at night and conquered it. Similarly, the huge table of food outside the castle gates may appear to be a friendly gesture, but it could actually be a trap.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the table of food is a Trojan horse, and the "service charge" is the army of soldiers hidden inside it that will attempt to take over the castle. The joke is a play on the fact that many restaurants nowadays have a "service charge" or "tip" added onto the bill even if the service wasn't that great.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In this context, "service charge" could refer to the fact that there is a Trojan horse hidden among the food on the table, which could be seen as a "service" to the attackers. However, it could also refer to the fact that the food is probably for a special event or occasion, and so there may be a hidden fee for eating it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the trojan horse is really a Trojan horse in disguise. When the soldiers inside the horse gift it to the castle gates, they will be welcomed in, but once they're inside, they'll charge the residents for the food. This is a play on the common service charges that are added to bills at restaurants.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "service charge". In a restaurant, a "service charge" is an extra fee that is sometimes added to the bill; it is usually given to the waitstaff as a tip. However, in this context, the "service charge" is referring to the gift of food being given as a Trojan horse, which is a hidden danger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The "hidden service charge" refers to the the infamous Trojan Horse: in the Trojan War, the Greeks snuck into Troy in a huge wooden horse, which the Trojans thought was a gift. However, the Greeks inside the horse were actually soldiers, and they proceeded to slaughter the Trojans. In this joke, the "hidden service charge" is the Greeks hidden inside the Trojan Horse, which is actually a giant table full of food. TheTrojan Horse was actually a giant table full of food.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
