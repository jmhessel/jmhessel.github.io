The waiter is asking if they can tell the customer about items that aren't on the menu, but the customer can't see. This could mean that the waiter is going to tell the customer about items that are off the menu (and therefore, not available), or it could mean that the waiter is going to tell the customer about items that are not on the menu because they are not written down. Either way, the customer is in for a surprise.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The waiter is asking if the customer would like to hear about some menu items that aren't on the menu, i.e., items that the restaurant doesn't have. However, the customer can also interpret the waiter's question as being about items that aren't on the menu, i.e., items that the waiter will make up or that are secret menu items.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The waiter is asking if the customer would like to hear about some "specials" that the restaurant is offering, but the fact that the menu is so huge implies that there are already so many choices that the customer might not be able to make up their mind. The waiter's suggestion of more choices is thus humorous.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="9.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="11.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
