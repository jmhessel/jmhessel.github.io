The joke is a play on the common phrase "yeah, but that's not the point," which is used to brush off a criticism or objection. In this case, the centaur is using the phrase to dismiss the snail man's objection that he has no chance of winning the race.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The race that the centaur is talking about is a running race, but the word "race" can also mean a person's ethnicity or ancestry. In this case, the centaur is saying that the snail man doesn't stand a chance in the race because he is not built for speed. However, the snail man could be of a different race than the centaur, which would give him an advantage in the race.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="203.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="205.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
