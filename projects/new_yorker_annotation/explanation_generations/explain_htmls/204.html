The person in the straitjacket is so unprofessional that they are being let go, despite the good news being that they are being let go.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people in the situation are in a professional setting, an office, and they are both restrained in straight jackets. The person in charge is telling the other person that they are "letting them go," which is usually a good thing. However, given the restraints, it's not clear how the other person will be able to leave.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "letting you go" can mean two things: (1) to release someone from captivity or (2) to firing someone from their job. In this case, the people in straight jackets are being let go in the sense that they are being fired.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who is being let go from the straight jacket is probably being let go from the job, or from the company. The fact that they were in a straight jacket to begin with is strange, and suggests that the company was not a very stable or sane place to work.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in the straitjacket is probably expecting to be fired, given that they are in a meeting with their boss and are wearing a straitjacket. However, the boss instead says that they are "letting [him] go", meaning that he is being released from the straitjacket. The joke is clever because it uses the double-meaning of the phrase "letting you go" to be both literal and figurative.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in the straitjacket is in a very vulnerable position and the other person is telling him that he's being let go from his job. The joke plays on the idea that being let go from a job can be a very stressful and terrifying experience.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in the straitjacket is seemingly being interviewed for a job, even though it's unlikely that they would be able to complete the interviewer's questions while in a straitjacket. The interviewers says that they have good news for the person in the straitjacket: they are letting him go. This is good news for the person in the straitjacket because it means he won't have to be in the straitjacket for the duration of the interview.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in the straitjacket is probably expecting to be fired, and is instead being told that they are being let go. The straitjacket is a metaphor for the situation they are in, which is constrained and without hope.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "letting you go": in this context, the phrase usually means that someone is being fired from their job. However, in this case, the two people are literally being let go, because they are being released from their straight jackets.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in the straitjacket is about to be "let go" by the other person in the room, who is presumably their boss. "Letting go" is a euphemism for firing someone, and it's usually not done in such a direct and literal manner. The straitjacketed person is probably relieved to be let go, given the uncomfortable circumstances.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the phrase "letting you go" can mean two things. The first is that the person is no longer under observation and is free to leave (i.e., the straight jacket is being removed). The second is that the person is being fired from their job. In this case, the person is being let go in both senses of the phrase.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people in stray jackets are in a meeting about their professional future, and the person in charge is telling them that they are being let go, or fired. This is good news for them, because it means they don't have to stay in the office any longer, but it's also bad news because it means they don't have a job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person being interviewed is being asked if he has any news, to which he replies that he does have some good news: he's being let go. The fact that they are both in straight jackets makes the joke even funnier, because it implies that the interviewer is also a patient in the mental institution.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is telling the other person that they are being let go from their job in a very matter-of-fact way. It's even more unexpected because the man is wearing a straitjacket, which usually implies that the person is not in control of themselves. In this case, the man in the straitjacket is the one who is firing the other person, which is an ironic twist.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in the straitjacket is clearly not in a position to be productive in the office, and so the person in charge is giving them the news that they are being let go from the company. The joke is even funnier if the person in the straitjacket is actually the one who is supposed to be conducting the meeting.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="203.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="205.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
