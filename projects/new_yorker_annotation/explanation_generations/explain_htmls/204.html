The woman on the couch is being shot at with bullets, which is a very hostile act. However, the therapist is focused on the emotions of the woman, and is interpreting her body language as indicating hostility, rather than fear or pain. This misunderstanding is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is trying to maintain a sense of normalcy and calm in the face of what is obviously a very hostile and dangerous situation. By saying that he's sensing hostility, he's acknowledging the hostile situation but trying to downplay it as no big deal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: "sensing" can mean both detecting feelings/emotions, which is what therapists do, and detecting danger, which is what people do when they hear gunshots. In this case, the therapist is detecting both the patient's hostile emotions, and the danger of the bullets coming through the window.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is being very matter-of-fact about the situation, even though there is a clear and present danger. It's as if the therapist is more concerned about the woman's emotional state than the fact that there is a gunfight going on outside.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is completely ignoring the fact that the window has been smashed and there are bullets coming into the room. He is instead focusing on the woman's feelings, even though it's clear that she is in danger. The joke is a play on the idea that therapists are more interested in talking about feelings than solving problems.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is trying to stay calm in the midst of a shootout, and so he remains professional and tries to understand the woman's feelings despite the gunfire. This is absurd because the therapist is in no position to be helping the woman with her feelings at that moment, and so his comment is out-of-touch and inappropriate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the therapist is literally sensing hostility because there are bullets flying around the room, but she could also be figuratively sensing hostility from the patient. TheHostility from the patient. The therapist's quip is a standard line used by therapists in order to diffuse hostility in the room, but in this case, it's also a commentary on the literally hostile situation the therapist is in.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "I'm sensing some hostility" could be something a therapist might say to a patient during a session in which the patient is expressing anger. However, in this case, the therapist is literally sensing hostility because there is a shootout going on outside, and the therapist is trying to take cover.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is being literal when she says she is sensing hostility. In this case, the hostility is being manifested in the form of bullets flying through the window towards her. The joke is clever because it plays with the double meaning of "sensing": in addition to detecting emotions, "sensing" can also mean detecting physical stimuli like heat or sound.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is being shot at, and yet, he's still trying to keep up the appearance that he's a collected professional. Instead ofopterfisownivgo the fact that there's a literal gunfight going on in his office, he comments on the "hostility" he's sensing from the woman on his couch.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The therapist is trying to use their psychiatric training to assess the emotional state of the patient, but in reality, the situation is quite hostile, with the therapist having to literally duck for cover from the gunfire. The joke suggests that the therapist is not very good at their job if they are unable to distinguish between real hostility and someone just acting out.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is completely ignoring the fact that there is a gunfight going on outside and instead tries to analyze the woman's feelings. The woman, who is the patient, is likely feeling scared and confused, but the therapist is either clueless or tries to use the situation to further his own agenda.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Sensing some hostility" is a common idiom which means that the person is perceiving anger in the other person.
