The whale is asking for the person in the front seat to move their seat up so that he can be more comfortable, which is a comical request given the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman in the front seat is being asked by her husband if she can adjust her seat, and it's unclear whether he's referring to the car seat or moving closer to her. However, the fact that there's a whale in the backseat makes it clear that he's referring to the car seat, since the whale is obviously taking up a lot of space and making it difficult for the woman to move her seat back.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common issue of people being too close together in a small space, like a car. In this case, the problem is exacerbated by the fact that there is a giant whale in the backseat, making it even harder for the two people to be comfortable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "moved up in the world". In this case, the man in the backseat is a whale, and so he is literally asking the person in the front seat to move up so that he can have more room. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the idea of dating someone who is "out of your league" - in this case, the woman in the front seat is dating someone who is literally a whale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common situation where a passenger in the backseat of a car asks the person in the front seat to move their seat up so they have more room. However, in this case, the passenger is a whale, which is an animal that is much larger than a human and doesn't need a seatbelt. The fact that the whale is in the car at all is already unusual, so the joke is even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the backseat is very large, and is taking up a lot of space in the car. The woman in the front seat is asking the man in the back if he can move his seat up, so she can have more room. However, because he is a whale, he is even larger than a normal man, and so she can't move her seat up even if he does.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the whale is so large that it is taking up the whole backseat, and one of the passengers is asking the other to adjust their seat because the whale is so big. This is a play on the common request to "move your seat up" when someone is sitting in front of another person and is taking up too much space.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common request for someone to move their seat up so that someone else can sit down. However, in this case, the person who is supposed to move their seat is a whale, which is not only impossible, but also suggests that the person asking is either very large themselves or expecting the whale to squish itself into a smaller space.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "move your seat up" is often used to ask someone to move closer to the front so that others can have more room in the back. However, in this case, the person in the front seat is being asked to move their seat up so that the whale in the back can have more room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the whale is in the backseat of the car, and is thus asking the person in the front seat to move their seat up so that he can be more comfortable. This is silly because, as mentioned before, whales can't survive out of water, so the fact that the whale is in the car at all is already humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that whales are very large creatures. The woman in the front seat is probably uncomfortable because the whale is so large and is taking up a lot of space in the backseat. The man is asking her to move her seat up so that the whale can be more comfortable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the whale is the driver's seatmate, and is asking the person in the passenger seat if they can adjust their seat to accommodate the whale. This is absurd because whales are massive creatures and would never be able to fit in a car, let alone sit in a seat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the whale is in the backseat, and is probably quite large. The front passenger is being squished by the whale, and is asking the driver if they can adjust their seat. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the phrase "Can you move your seat up?", which is often said by people who are trying to get intimate with their partner in a car. In this case, the person in the backseat is too large to be ignored, and is frustrating the person in the front seat, who just wants some space.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common request for people to move their seats up so that others can have more room. In this case, the person making the request is the whale, who is already taking up a lot of space in the car. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words; the whale is literally asking the person to move their seat up, but the phrasing can also be interpreted to mean that the whale is asking the person to move closer to it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because whales are usually found in the ocean, but this one is in the backseat of a car. The whale is asking the couple if they can adjust their seats, which is a normal request, but the fact that the whale is in the car is humorous.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="152.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="154.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
