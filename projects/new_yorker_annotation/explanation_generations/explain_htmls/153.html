The man is asking his wife to explain the clause in their insurance policy that covers acts of God, but he is also asking her to explain why a cement block is falling on his head. The wife, who is not looking up, remains unaware of the impending danger, making the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "act of God" clause is usually a clause in contracts that absolves the parties of responsibility in the case of an event that is outside of their control, like a natural disaster. In this case, the man is asking his wife to explain it again because he doesn't understand why a cinderblock falling from the sky would be considered an "act of God." However, he is actually being literal: he doesn't understand why an act of God would be happening to them in a restaurant. The joke is funny because it's a misunderstanding of the phrase.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the men is about to be killed by a chunk of concrete falling on his head, and the other man is calmly asking for a repetition of the explanation of their insurance policy's "act of God" clause. This is unexpected because, usually, someone in the situation would be panicking, or at least would not be so casual about the impending death of their friend/companion.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "act of God" is often used in insurance contracts to describe an event that is beyond the control of humans and thus not covered by the insurance policy. In this case, the "act of God" is the cinderblock falling from the sky, which is obviously something that humans can't control. The man asking for the explanation is using the phrase literally, while the woman is using it in the insurance context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while normally, an Act of God clause in an insurance policy refers to natural disasters like floods or earthquakes, in this case, the act of God is the man's friend being killed by a cinder block falling on his head in a restaurant. The joke is clever because it's a play on words, using the phrase "act of God" in a new, unexpected way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man about to be hit by the cinder block is trying to hold his companion responsible for the accident by asking him to explain the insurance clause that protects against "acts of God." Of course, if the man does manage to avoid being hit by the cinder block, it would be more accurate to say it was an "act of God" than anything else.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man about to be hit by the cinder block is asking for the clause in their insurance contract that excuses the company from having to pay out if the event is due to an "act of God." This is a humorous way of saying that the man knows his impending doom is due to something unnatural, and thus, not the fault of the restaurant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in most contracts, the "act of God" clause protects both parties from damages that are out of their control and unforeseeable. However, in this case, the cinder block falling from the ceiling is both foreseeable ( because it's about to happen) and under the control of the person looking up at it. As such, the act of God clause does not protect the person about to be hit by the cinder block, and the speaker is asking for clarification because he does not want to be held liable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is about to be hit by a cement block, which is clearly not an act of God, but rather an act of negligence. The joke is clever because it uses the legal term "act of God" in a non-literal way to make a pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is dangerous and could lead to injury or death, but the man is more interested in the legal ramifications of the situation than he is in saving his own life. The fact that he is more worried about his insurance policy than he is about the cinderblock falling on his head is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, when people are about to be hit by something, they often ask if there's anything that can be done to stop it. In this case, the man about to be hit by the cinder block is asking his companion to explain the Act of God clause, which would absolve him of responsibility for any damages. Given that a cinder block shouldn't be falling from the ceiling in the first place, the man is trying to find a way to not be held responsible for the accident.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man about to be hit by the cinder block is asking for a clarification on insurance terminology. The 'act of God' clause often exempts natural disasters from being covered events, but this man is about to be hit by man-made object. Thus, he is hoping that his friend can explain what would happen if his death were caused by an 'act of God,' i.e., if he were to be hit by the cinder block.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is going to be injured by the falling cinderblock, but he is more concerned with the legal technicality of the "act of God" clause in his insurance policy. This is a play on the stereotype of lawyers being more concerned with winning than with justice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man at the table is about to be killed by a cinder block, which has fallen from the ceiling. He asks his friend to explain the "act of God" clause in their contract, which presumably would absolve the restaurant of any responsibility for his death. In other words, he is asking for a legal explanation for his impending death.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the act of God clause is usually used in insurance contracts to exempt the insurer from liability in the case of an unpredictable natural disaster, like a hurricane or tornado. However, in this situation, the cinder block falling from the ceiling is not a natural disaster, but an act of negligence on the part of the restaurant, and so the speaker is asking for an explanation of why he will not be compensated.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
