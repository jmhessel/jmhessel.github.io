The word "remember" can mean to recall a past event, but it can also mean to keep something in one's mind. In this case, the joke is using the latter definition, which makes the joke funnier because it's a callback to an earlier event in the story when one of the monsters made the other laugh so hard that people came out of its nose.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the two monsters: one is eating buildings and people and the other is laughing. The fact that the creature eating people is happy about it makes the joke even more darkly humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person framing the story seems to think that the time the other person made him laugh is the most important detail of the story, when in reality, the detail that's most important is that there are two giant monsters destroying a city. The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of how the two monsters are destroying the city: they are clearly doing it for fun, and the fact that one of them is happy and laughing as it eats people makes it even more absurd. The joke is a play on the phrase "remember that time when X happened", which is often used to reminisce about good times. In this case, the "good time" being referred to is the destruction of a city, which is clearly not something that should be laughed about.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected. The two monsters are destroying a city and one of them turns to the other and asks if it remembers the time when it made it laugh and people came out of its nose. This is unexpected because, first, monsters don't exist; secondly, even if they did exist, they would not be asking each other intimate questions like this; and third, the situation is very dire and they are in the middle of destroying a city, so it's unexpected that one would take the time to ask this question.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The first part of the sentence refers to the scene where one of the monsters is eating the other, and the second half refers to the fact that when people laugh, sometimes air comes out of their nose. So, the joke is saying that the first monster is laughing as it eats the second monster, and air is coming out of the second monster's nose.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is absurd to imagine that two large monsters could have a conversation while they are in the middle of destroying a city. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the phrase "laughing out loud", which is often abbreviated as "lol".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it play offs the fact that the two monsters are destroying the city. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the saying "you made me laugh so hard that I cried." In this case, instead of crying, people came out of the monster's nose.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non sequitur. The speaker is talking about a time when the other person made him laugh, but the listener is focused on the fact that the speaker is currently a giant monster rampaging through a city eating buildings. The idea of people coming out of his nose is just a weird and random detail that makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "rampage" can mean both to cause wanton destruction and to laugh uncontrollably. In this scenario, the monsters are causing wanton destruction by eating the buildings, but the joke implies that they are also rampaging (laughing uncontrollably) at the same time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the movie Godzilla, which is a movie about a large reptile monster that destroys a city. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the phrase "remember that time" usually refers to a happy memory, but in this case, it's referring to a time when the other monster was destroying the city.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common idiom "to laugh out loud." Instead of just laughing out loud, people are actually coming out of the person's nose. This could be interpreted as meaning that the person is so amused that they are laughing so hard that people are coming out of their nose, or it could be interpreted more literally to mean that the person's laugh is so monstrous that it causes people to come out of their nose.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is talking to one of the monsters who is currently eating a building, and the speaker is reminiscing about a time when the monster made him laugh so hard that people came out of his nose. The joke is made funnier by the contrast between the current situation (a monster eating a building) and the content of the memory (a monster making someone laugh).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non-sequitur. In the middle of the city being destroyed, one monster randomly brings up a memory of the other making it laugh, and then comments on the aftermath. It's unexpected and out-of-place, which makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is making a reference to a time when the other person made him laugh so hard that snot came out of his nose. The fact that the speaker is mentioning this while two giant monsters are destroying a city shows that even in the face of imminent danger, the speaker still has time to think about and reference this embarrassing moment.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="200.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="202.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
