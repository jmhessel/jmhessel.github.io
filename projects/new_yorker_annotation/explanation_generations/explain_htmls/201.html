The joke is clever because it is using a double meaning of the word "expectations": the boy is shoveling snow, and one would expect him to do a good job, but the man is saying that it's time for the boy to learn how to manage people's expectations, i.e., to manage what people expect of him. In other words, the boy needs to learn how to exceed people's expectations.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is saying that it is time for the boy to learn about "managing people's expectations". However, the boy is actually shoveling snow, so the man is saying that it is time for the boy to learn about "managing people's expectations" in regards to shoveling snow. This is humorous because it is unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because expectation management is a common workplace skill. In this case, the man is being literal: he is trying to manage the expectations of the person hiding in the snow, by telling them that it is time to learn about expectation management. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the man is using the words "expectation management" in a literal sense, whereas usually the phrase is used in a figurative sense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. When someone shovels snow, they are usually doing it to clear a path so people can walk through. However, in this case, the man is holding the shovel in such a way that it actually blocks the path, which goes against the expectations of what a snow shovel is supposed to do. Thus, the joke is cleverly poking fun at the fact that the man is not meeting the expectations of what he is supposed to be doing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's usually the case that people have to lower their expectations when it comes to shoveling snow, since it's such a difficult and tedious task. In this case, the man being told to lower his expectations is the one holding the shovel, which is the opposite of what usually happens.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is clearly not doing a very good job shoveling the snow, and the boy is giving him a lecture about how to manage people's expectations. The joke is clever because it is true --- in business and in life in general, it is important to manage people's expectations. If you set the expectation that you will do a great job, and then you only do a good job, people will be disappointed. But if you set the expectation that you will do a good job, and then you do a great job, people will be pleasantly surprised.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is telling the boy that it's time for him to learn about managing people's expectations. The joke is clever because it's true: in order to avoid having disappointed customers or workers, it's important to manage people's expectations by setting realistic expectations in the first place. However, the joke is also funny because the man is using a very business-like phrase ("managing people's expectations") in a very non-business context (a boy shoveling snow in front of a house).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is trying to teach the boy a lesson about business. The boy, who is shoveling snow, is not doing a very good job, and the man is trying to explain to him that in business, it's important to manage people's expectations. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words; the man is saying that the boy needs to learn about "managing people," but the boy is actually shoveling snow.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boy with the shovel is doing a chore that is typically associated with being an adult, while the man is standing around not doing anything. The joke is also a play on the phrase "managing people's expectations," which is often used in business settings. In this case, the boy is managing the expectations of the man by doing the shoveling himself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's usually the case that people shovel snow because they want to clear a path and make it easier for people to walk through. In contrast, the man in the joke is doing the opposite: he's making it harder for people to walk by making a path that's too small for most people to fit through. This creates a comical mismatch between what people expect (a nice, clear path) and what they get (a tiny, difficult-to-use path).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is talking about the "snow shoveling" expectation that people have in the winter. However, the fact that the person he is talking to is hiding in the snow makes it clear that the man is actually talking about the "managing people's expectations" expectation that people have in the business world. The contrast between the two expectations makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is telling the boy that it's time for him to learn about managing people's expectations. The fact that they are outside in the snow and the boy has a shovel implies that the man is telling the boy to shovel the sidewalk. However, the joke is that the man's statement about managing people's expectations is far too advanced for a simple task like shoveling the sidewalk. In other words, the man is over-complicating the boy's task and giving him advice that is not relevant to the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the two people's expectations. The man who is hidden in the snow is probably expecting that the other person will help him out, given that he is shoveling snow. However, the other person's expectations are probably that the man hidden in the snow will continue shoveling, since that is what people typically do in this situation. The joke is clever because it plays with the different expectations of the two people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is telling the boy that it is time for him to learn about managing people's expectations. The joke is clever because in order to shovel snow, one must have already shoveled snow, which means that the boy has likely been doing this job for a while. Thus, the man's advice to the boy is actually very apt: in order to do any job well, it is important to manage people's expectations.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is telling the boy that he needs to learn about managing people's expectations. The joke is clever because in order to manage people's expectations, the boy would need to be much older and have more experience. However, the joke could also be interpreted more literally to mean that the boy needs to shovel the snow in a way that meets people's expectations.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="200.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="202.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
