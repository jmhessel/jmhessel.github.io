The man is saying that at home, he and the animals are not allowed on the furniture, but here, in the psychiatrist's office, they are all sitting on furniture meant for humans. The joke is clever because it is a double meaning: the man is either saying that he and the animals are not allowed on the furniture at home because they are animals, or he is saying that he and the animals are not allowed on the furniture at home because they are not supposed to be sitting on furniture meant for humans. Either way, the joke is clever and funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is saying that, at his home, the animals are not allowed on the furniture, which is why they are all sitting in chaise longue sofas in the psychiatrist's office. This is funny because it's a reversal of the usual roles: usually, it's the humans who are sitting on furniture while the animals are not allowed, but in this case, it's the animals who are sitting on furniture while the humans are not allowed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it is common for people to have pets that aren't allowed on the furniture, it is less common for the pets to be aware of this rule and to be able to verbalize it. In this case, the dog, cat, and bird are all sitting on furniture in the psychiatrist's office, and the fish is in a bowl on the coffee table, indicating that they are all breaking the rules they have at home.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="200.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="202.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
