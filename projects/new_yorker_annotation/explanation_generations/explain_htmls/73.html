He knows that she's not going to let it go, meaning that she's going to keep bothering him about it even though he doesn't care. This is a situation where the two people are clearly not on the same page.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker implies that the person they are talking to is going to hold a grudge over the argument they just had. However, the context of the scene (a burning wasteland) is such that holding a grudge would be futile: the speaker and the person they are talking to are both dressed in rags, sitting on rocks in the middle of a wasteland, and the buildings around them are crumbling. In this context, it is absurd to think that the person would be able to hold a grudge, because they have much bigger problems to worry about.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the couple's outfits and the destruction around them. The man and woman are dressed up as if they are going to a formal event, but they are instead in the middle of a wasteland. The woman's remark to the man also serves as a reminder that even though they are in a difficult situation, they are still in a relationship and need to communicate with each other.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman isuttering vevy for a moment, but I've decided that I don't care.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman in the picture is looking at the man with a look that says "I know you're not going to let this go," in response to him asking her a question. The man is likely asking her about the city being destroyed in the background, and she is not interested in discussing it. The look on her face is one of annoyance and amusement, as if she knows that he is not going to drop the subject.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man and woman look completely out of place in the destroyed city, as if they had just been teleported there. The joke is that the woman recognizes the man's look: he's not going to let the situation go, and is going to ask her out on a date despite the destroyed city around them. This would be a very strange thing to do, and the joke is funny because it pokes fun at the man's obliviousness.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's face looks like she is about to start crying, and the man looks like he is about to give in to her. The fact that they are surrounded by destruction implies that they have just been through a very tough situation, possibly a natural disaster, and the woman is not willing to let it go. The man is likely trying to comfort her, but she is not ready to be comforted yet.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: "let this go" can mean either "to stop talking/thinking about something" or "to release something". In the context of the post-apocalyptic scene, the latter meaning is clearly implied, as the man is referring to the woman's grip on a large rock. The woman's firm grip is incongruous with the crumbling world around them, which suggests she is holding on to the rock for dear life. Given the dire circumstances, the man's comment that he knows that look implying she won't let go is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is assuming that the other person is going to continue to be angry, when in fact, they have no reason to be angry anymore. The speaker is also making a pun on the word "let": in this context, "let" can mean either to allow or to release. So the speaker is asking if the other person is going to "allow" this anger to continue, or if they are going to "release" it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man and woman are sitting on a bench, which is typically a piece of furniture found in parks, not in the middle of a destroyed city. The woman's comment implies that the man has a history of being stubborn and not letting things go, even when it would be better for him to do so. In this case, the woman is probably referring to the fact that the city is in ruins and they should leave, but the man is likely to want to stay and try to rebuild it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man and woman's clothing and the destruction in the background are incongruous: they're dressed as if they're going on a date in a romantic city, but the city is in ruins. The woman's expression seems to say "I know you're not going to let this go," i.e., that the man is going to insist on going through with the date despite the destruction. The joke is clever because it's both a play on words (letting go vs. not letting go) and a play on the incongruity between the situation and the woman's reaction.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because normalcy is assumed in the middle of a disaster, with the man and woman continuing their banal conversation despite the destruction around them. The woman is about to scold the man for some unspecified thing he's done, and the man preemptively tries to placate her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is obviously angry at the man, and he says that he knows "that look," implying that he knows what she's thinking. But "that look" could also refer to the fact that they are both covered in soot and ash, and have a rightfully worried expressions on their faces, given the destruction around them. So "that look" could also mean that he knows they are in a lot of trouble.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's facial expression suggests that she is about to bring up a touchy subject with the man, who already looks like he knows what she is going to say and doesn't want to talk about it. The destroyed city in the background adds to the joke by suggesting that they are the only two people left in the world, and yet their relationship is still strained.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's quizzical look could be interpreted in a number of ways, but the man correctly guesses that she is not going to drop the subject matter they are discussing. The joke is funny because it is a play on words: the reader might first think that the man is talking about the woman's body language, but he is actually talking about the topic of conversation. In the context of the wasteland, the joke is also funny because it is a relief to see two people acting normal amidst all of the chaos.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="72.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="74.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
