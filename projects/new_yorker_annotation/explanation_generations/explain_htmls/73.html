The interviewer is just focused on the man's qualifications for the job, and whether or not he can start immediately. The situation is unusual because it's not often that someone gets interviewed for a job while there is an active hostile work environment going on.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man being interviewed for the job is completely nonplussed by the fact that three men with weapons are chasing out another person. This implies that the job he's interviewing for is one where such a scene is not only commonplace, but also acceptable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man being interviewed is completely unfazed by the scene of violence unfolding before him. This likely means that he's seen this happen before, or that he is used to violence in general (perhaps he's in the mafia?). In contrast, the interviewer is so shocked that he forgets to ask the man any questions about his qualifications for the job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man being interviewed is being asked how soon he can start the job, even though it's clear that the job is not going to be available for very long. The person being chased out probably quit or was fired, and so the job will be open soon, but it's still an odd question to ask in an interview.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a normal question to ask during a job interview, but the context of the question is absurd. The person being interviewed is about to witness a violent act, and it's unclear if the position he is interviewing for is the one that the person being chased out held. The joke could be interpreted as the company being so desperate to fill the position that they are willing to hire anyone, even if they witness a violent act.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common interview question "Where do you see yourself in five years?" Usually, people say they want to be in the same job or a similar job, but in this case, the man being interviewed says he wants the job that the person being chased out currently holds. The joke is clever because it's a play on words --- "start" can refer to the beginning of the job, or it can refer to starting over in the same job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that people who work in office jobs are often boring and uninteresting. The man being interviewed is so uninterested in the job that he doesn't even care that there is a hostile work environment, he just wants to know when he can start.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the interviewer is completely oblivious to the fact that there is a hostile takeover happening right outside the glass cubicle he's sitting in. The interviewee is being asked when he can start working, as if the fact that there is an armed takeover in progress is not a big deal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is being interviewed is completely nonchalant about the fact that there is a hostile work environment in his potential office; he is more interested in when he can start the job than he is in the safety concerns that come with it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the interviewer, instead of being taken aback or distracted by the hostile work environment that is playing out in front of him, is still focused on the interview and is nonchalantly asking the interviewee when he can start the job. This shows that the interviewer either doesn't care about the hostile work environment or is so used to it that it doesn't phase him. Either way, it's a humorous take on the typical office environment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man being interviewed is completely nonchalant about the fact that three men with weapons are chasing out the person who used to hold the job he's interviewing for. The joke is a play on the idea that job interviews are often stressful, and the interviewee is trying to act calm to seem like a good fit for the job. The chaos in the background is a metaphor for the stress of the job interview process.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man interviewing for the job asks how soon the person being interviewed can start, and the person being interviewed says "now" because they are currently being chased out of the office. The joke is therefore a pun on the phrase "how soon can you start".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of the scene, it's clear that the interviewer is not interested in the man's qualifications, but rather, how soon he can start the job, implying that it's a desirable job because it's being highly contested for. The situation is unusual because it's not common for people to be chased out of their job by others with weapons, making it a joke about a unique and dangerous work environment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man being interviewed is so nonchalant about the events occurring behind him, as if it's a completely normal thing that happens in this office during job interviews. This is in contrast to the person being chased out, who is clearly alarmed and stressed by the situation. The joke is a play on the interview question "How soon can you start?" which is often asked near the end of an interview.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man being interviewed is so nonchalant about the scene unfolding before him. It's as if he's used to seeing people being chased out of offices with guns, and he's just waiting for his turn. This is unexpected because, normally, people would be very surprised and scared if they saw something like this happening, but the man being interviewed just sees it as an opportunity to get the job.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="72.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="74.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
