The new manager is a fat white guy with no pants.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two women are discussing how all of the managers at the store are fat white guys with no pants. This is a reference to the stereotype that all mall/department store managers are fat, white guys who wear khakis without a belt. The fact that there is a snowman in the store is odd, and suggests that the store is in a cold climate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a stereotype that the new manager of a store is a fat white guy. In this case, the stereotype is true, but what's surprising is that the new manager is a snowman, who doesn't typically wear pants. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words; the phrase "surprise, surprise" is typically used to express sarcasm, but in this case, the speaker is actually surprised.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "the new boss is the same as the old boss." In this case, the new boss is literally the same as the old one, just a snowman. This joke is clever because it's a visual way of saying that the new boss is just like the old one.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snowman is a metaphor for the managers of the store, who are hidden from view but still observing the customers. The joke is also funny because it playfully pokes at the stereotype that fat, white guys are always the ones in charge.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is unexpected that the snowman would be shopping at the store. The co-workers make an assumption about the new manager based on the snowman's appearance, which is that he is a fat white guy with no pants, when in reality, the snowman is not the new manager. This joke is clever because it playfully challenges our assumptions about who or what can be in a position of authority.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is unexpected. The snowman is shopping at the store, and the co-workers do not seem to notice. The joke is a play on the common stereotype of a "fat white guy with no pants" being a snowman.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the management at the store is not competent. The new manager is a snowman, who is not a human being. The joke might also be interpreted as a racist or sexist comment, since the snowman is white and male.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snowman is an inanimate object and thus would not be capable of being the new manager at the store. The joke is also a play on the stereotype that most managers are white men.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that white males are often overrepresented in management positions. The fact that the snowman is fat and white and has no pants on makes the joke even funnier, because it reinforces the stereotype.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two women store employees are gossiping about their new manager, and they are surprised to see that he is a snowman. The joke is a play on the stereotype that people in management positions are often overweight and not well-dressed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snowman, being white and fat, resembles the stereotype of a new manager at a department store. The fact that the snowman has no pants on makes it even funnier, because it's a further exaggeration of the stereotype.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman on the left is surprised to see that the new manager is a snowman, which is a white guy, which is also a reference to the fact that the new manager is fat. The joke is also clever because it's true that snowmen don't usually wear pants.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two women employees are surprised that the new manager is a snowman. The snowman is, of course, a white male, which is a stereotype of managers, and he's also fat, which is another stereotype. But the snowman is also pantsless, which is not a stereotype of managers, and which is what makes this joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that people in management positions are fat, white, and male. In this case, the snowman is fat, white, and has no pants, which is a more literal version of the stereotype.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is unexpected that a snowman would be shopping at a store, let alone wearing clothes. The snowman is also a clear metaphor for the new manager, who is also described as a "fat white guy with no pants". The joke is clever because it is both unexpected and relevant to the situation.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="239.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="241.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
