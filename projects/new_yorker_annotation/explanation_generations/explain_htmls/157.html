In this case, the joke is clever because the situation is actually quite the opposite: the tall tale would be that someone caught and released a whale, when in reality, the whale is the one who is caught (and possibly about to die).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the play on words: "tale" can mean both a story and a whale's appendage. In this context, the joke is about how the person couldn't let the whale go because no one would believe such a crazy story.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the pun on the phrase "catch and release". In this context, the phrase usually refers to catching a fish and then throwing it back into the water so it can live; however, in this context, the phrase refers to catching a whale (which is not a fish) and then releasing it... on the side of the road. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the phrase "tall tale", which is a story that is hard to believe.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "whale of a tale." On the one hand, it is a pun because the man "caught" a whale, which is a large sea creature. On the other hand, the phrase "whale of a tale" is often used to describe an incredibly tall tale or story --- in this case, the fact that the man has a whale in his backseat would definitely be considered a tall tale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the play on words with "whale" and "tale." In this context, a "whale of a tale" is a tall tale, or a story that is hard to believe. The fact that the couple has a whale in their car is hard to believe, and the fact that they caught it and then released it would be an even taller tale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "catch and release" is typically used when people go fishing and then let the fish go. In this case, the person is saying that even if they did catch the whale, no one would believe such a big fish was caught, so it is not worth it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "Catch and release." Normally, "catch and release" refers to the practice of catching fish and then releasing them back into the wild. However, in this case, the person "caught" a whale, which is an animal that is not typically caught (because they live in the ocean). The person could tell a "whale of a tale" about how he "caught" the whale, but no one would believe him, which is why he had to keep the whale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the overlap between the meaning of "whale" (a very large mammal) and "tale" (an amusing or interesting story, often one that is tall or not true). In this case, the person in the car is telling a "tall tale" about catching a whale, but the joke is that the whale is actually behind the car. So, the story is both true and not true.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the double meaning of "whale of a tale." On the one hand, it's a reference to the size of the whale, which is so large it's hard to believe. On the other hand, it's a reference to the phrase "a tall tale," which is a story that is so incredible it's hard to believe. Thus, the joke is cleverly punning on the size of the whale and its potential to tell tall tales.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the play on words. "Catch and release" usually refers to the act of fishing, where you catch a fish and then release it back into the wild. In this case, the person caught a whale, which is an unusual thing to catch, and then had to keep it because releasing it would be even more unusual and no one would believe the story.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the play on words with the phrase "catch and release". In this context, "catch and release" refers to fishing, where you catch a fish and then release it back into the water. However, the fact that there is a whale on the road means that the person catching the whale would need to release it into the water in order to save its life. The joke is clever because it ties together the two meanings of "catch and release" in a humorous way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Catch and release" is a method of fishing where you catch a fish and then let it go. In this case, the person couldn't let the whale go because no one would believe the story of how they caught it. The joke is also funny because it is an unlikely situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Catch and release" is a method of fishing where you catch a fish and then let it go; in this scenario, the person catches a whale. The phrase "a whale of a tale" means a tall tale, or a story that is hard to believe. So the joke is that the person couldn't tell the story of catching a whale because it would be so hard to believe.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of the word "catch": in the context of fishing, "catch and release" means to catch a fish and then let it go. However, in this context, the word "catch" refers to the act of catching the whale, which is much more difficult than catching a fish. The man is saying that he couldn't let the whale go because no one would believe him if he told them he caught a whale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of the word "catch": in this context, "catch" can mean to fish for a whale, or it can mean to capture something. The person is saying that he couldn't release the whale because no one would believe his story --- meaning, either they wouldn't believe his story of catching the whale, or they wouldn't believe his story of finding a whale in his car.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="156.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="158.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
