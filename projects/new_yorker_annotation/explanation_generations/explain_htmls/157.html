In this case, the word "kitsch" refers to something that is gaudy or tacky, and is also a homophone for the word "kiss." Thus, the joke is that the trophy fish was mounted on the wall in a tacky way, but was later "released" back into the ocean, where it was able to continue its life.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the word "catch and release". In fishing, catch and release is the practice of catching a fish and then releasing it back into the wild; "kitsch and release" would be the act of catching a fish and then releasing it into someone's home as a decoration. The joke is clever because it's a play on words, but it's also funny because it's unexpected: you wouldn't expect a fish to be caught and then released into someone's home as a decoration.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "they call it quits and call it a day" means that two people are Done with each other and they're going their separate ways. In this case, the mounted fish is still alive and was released back into the ocean, so "they call it kitsch and release" means that the mounted fish was let go.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Kitsch" means something that is gaudy or tacky, like the Big Mouth Billy Bass. But "kitsch" can also mean a type of releasing fish back into the wild. So the joke is that the fish was mounted on the wall like a trophy, but was actually just released back into the wild (the ocean), and is now angry because it was tricked.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "catch and release" is often used when people go fishing and they want to throw the fish back into the water after catching it. However, in this case, the fish has been mounted on a wall like a trophy, which is known as "kitsch". The phrase "catch and release" becomes "kitsch and release" in this context, which is funny because it is a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of the word "release": in a normal scenario, "release" would mean to let go of or set free. However, the fact that the fish is mounted on the wall like a trophy re-contextualizes the word "release": in this context, "release" means to ejaculate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The mounted fish is angry because it's been hung on a wall like a trophy, but it's also been released back into the wild. The word "kitsch" is a German word meaning "gaudy or tacky art", so the joke is that the fish has been both gaudy art and released.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a pun on the word "kitsch." In this context, "kitsch" means a tacky or low-brow item of pop culture. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the common phrase "catch and release," which is used when people fish for recreation but don't actually want to keep the fish they catch. In this case, the person who caught the fish (likely the one who mounted it on the wall) has had a change of heart and wants to release it back into the wild.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the juxtaposition of the mounted fish, which is a tacky decoration that people typically hang on their walls, and the fact that it is still alive and back in the ocean.

The phrase "they call it" can refer to both the act of giving something a name, and to a group of people giving something a name. In this case, the phrase "they call it kitsch" is a play on words because the mounted fish is both a real fish (that was given the name "kitsch"), and a fake fish (that was given the name "release").</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Kitsch" is a type of art that is low-quality but sentimental and popular, whereas "kitchen" is a type of room in a house.

In this case, the joke is that the fish has been mounted on the wall like a piece of kitsch art, but it has been released back into the ocean.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the two fish. One is free, swimming around and enjoying the ocean, while the other is trapped, mounted on a wall like a trophy. The mounted fish is still alive, which makes the situation even more unusual and surreal. The joke is clever because it playfully pokes at the idea of "kitsch": something that is trashy or tacky, but also strangely compelling or enjoyable. In this case, the mounted fish is both tacky and strangely compelling because it is still alive and swimming around, even though it is trapped.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Kitsch" is a German word meaning "crap" or "something that is gaudy or in bad taste." The mounted fish is an example of kitsch because it's a tacky decoration. The other meaning of "release" is to let go of something. In this case, the mounted fish has been released from the wall and is back in the ocean. The joke is clever because it comments on the nature of kitsch: something that is tacky or in bad taste is often still beloved by someone, and so even though it's not aesthetically pleasing, it still has a certain charm.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the mounted fish is a Big Mouth Billy Bass, a common gag gift that has a fish mechanically opens and closes its mouth.
