However, the car is autonomous, meaning that it is in control of itself, which goes against the therapist's usual role of being in control. The joke is clever because it makes a play on words: the car is impotent (i.e., without power) because it's a patient, but it's also impotent because it's a car and can't have children.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The car is struggling with impotence, which means it can't park itself. The therapist is saying that the car's feelings of impotence probably started when it was being assembled, which is another way of saying that the car was "put together" (i.e., built).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The car is impotent, meaning it can't have sex, because it's not a living creature. However, the car is also feeling out of control because it's being assembled against its will --- in other words, it's being put together (assembled) without its consent. The joke is clever because it's using the double meaning of the word "impotent" to make a pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's playing on the fact that cars are often seen as phallic symbols. The therapist is saying that the car's feelings of impotence (i.e., powerlessness) began when it was being assembled, which is a play on the idea that a man's impotence might begin when he is in the process of being born.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's absurd to think that a car would go to therapy and because it implies that the car is sexually impotent. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the car is impotent (unable to have sex) and also impotent (unable to control itself).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "impotence" that the car is feeling is both the inability to perform sexually and the feeling of powerlessness. The car is experiencing both of these things because it's being controlled by someone else (the driver) and it's not able to move on its own. The joke is clever because it takes a common expression ("being out of control") and gives it a new meaning in the context of a car.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the double meaning of the word "impotence." On the one hand, it could refer to the powerlessness the car feels when it's being controlled by the driver. On the other hand, it could refer to the car's literal inability to reproduce, since it's a machine. The contrast between the two meanings is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The therapist is talking to the car about how it feels impotent (powerless) when it's forced to do things like parallel park. However, the therapist is also saying that the car is impotent (sexually powerless) because it's a machine that was assembled, rather than being born.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "impotence" can mean both the inability to have an erection, and the powerlessness to do something. In this case, the car is feeling impotent because it can't control its own parallel parking. The joke is also clever because it's using the fact that cars are often assembly-line made to explain why the car might feel impotent: it's because it was put together by a machine, rather than by itself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is talking to the car as if it is a patient. She is saying that the car's impotence (i.e., inability to drive itself) is due to its assembly process. This is a play on the fact that cars are often assembled in factories by robots, which are themselves impotent.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Impotence" can mean both a feeling of powerless and being unable to get an erection. In this case, the therapist is saying that the car's feeling of being powerless (impotence) is due to the fact that it was put together (assembled) by humans, and thus it is under their control.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the psychotherapist is giving psychological advice to a car, which is effectively inanimate and cannot understand or act on her advice. She starts to address the "impotence" that the car is feeling, which is a metaphor for the feeling of being powerless/out of control. However, the joke takes a turn when the therapist says that the car's impotence started when it was "being assembled" --- in other words, the car has always been powerless, and will never be able to change that fact.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the fact that a car is an inanimate object. The therapist is trying to understand the "feelings" of the car, but because a car cannot feel, the therapist is probably looking at the situation from a human perspective. The therapist is projecting human feelings onto the car, and the joke is that the car doesn't actually feel any of those things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is giving advice to a car, which is an inanimate object, about the root of its problems. The car is impotent, or powerless, because it's being controlled by someone else. The therapist is saying that the car's feeling of being out of control started when it was being assembled, suggesting that the car is powerless because it was created by humans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's play on the idea of a car being "psychologically impotent" --- in other words, not having the agency to control its own destiny. The joke is also clever because it ties in the car's physical impotence (being unable to move on its own) with the idea of psychological impotence.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="102.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="104.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
