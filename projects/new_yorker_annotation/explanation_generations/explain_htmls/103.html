The woman is staring at the cactus because she is surprised that it is moving. The man she is with (presumably her husband) said that the cactus wouldn't need much attention, but clearly it does since it is walking around.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is surprised that the cactus is following them, even though she was told that it wouldn't need much attention. This plays on the idea that cacti are low-maintenance plants that don't require a lot of care, but the cactus in this situation is very active and needy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually, cacti are low-maintenance plants that don't need to be watered often; however, this cactus has legs and is walking, implying that it needs a lot of attention. The woman is staring at it because she's probably never seen a cactus move before.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is saying that he thought the woman said that the cactus wouldn't need much attention, meaning that it wouldn't need to be watered very often. However, the woman took this to mean that the cactus wouldn't need much care in general, not realizing that it needed to be watered at all. The joke is clever because it is a pun on the word "attention".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman said that the cactus wouldn't need much attention, but clearly it does because it is running after them. The joke is also funny because it is a pun on the word "attention", which can mean both notice/care, as in "give attention to the cactus", or focus/concentration, as in "the cactus has our attention".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is worried about the cactus following them, when in reality cactuses are not able to move. The joke plays on the idea that cactuses are low-maintenance plants that don't need much water or attention, but the woman is clearly worried that this cactus is not living up to that reputation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is surprised that the cactus is following them, even though she was told that it wouldn't need much attention. The joke is a play on words, as the word "attention" can mean both "care and support" and "notice or focus". In the former sense, the woman is clearly surprised that the cactus is following them despite being told it wouldn't need much care; in the latter sense, the woman is surprised that the cactus is following them, even though she wasn't paying attention to it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is staring at the cactus because she's surprised that it's walking; she expected it to just sit there like a regular cactus. The man is joking that the cactus needs attention because it's not just sitting there like she thought it would.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is running from the cactus because it's after her, and the man is running with her. The man is alsodehydrated, and so he's making a pun about how the cactus needs water (attention) to live.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cactus is doing something that cacti don't usually do: walking around on legs. The woman is staring at it in disbelief, and the man jogger is making a joke about how he thought she said that the cactus wouldn't need much attention. This is a play on words, because the man is saying that he thought she said the cactus wouldn't need attention, but clearly it does need attention because it's doing something that cacti don't normally do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because woman is talking to the man jogging next to her, and she is clearly surprised by the fact that the cactus is walking. The man, presumably her husband, said that the cactus wouldn't need much attention, but clearly it does --- it needs to be watered, fed, and given a place to live.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is clearly worried about the cactus following them, when in reality cactus cannot move. The joke is a play on the fact that people often joke about how cacti are "low-maintenance" house plants that don't need much watering or care --- in contrast, the woman in the situation is clearly worried that the cactus is following them and will need a lot of attention.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is talking to her husband, who is one of the joggers, about the cactus. The word "attention" can mean two things: care/nurturing (e.g., "I need to give my cactus some attention") or focus/notice (e.g., "I can't believe we're being chased by a giant walking cactus, it's like we're in a B-movie"). In this case, it's the latter meaning --- the couple is so focused on their jog, they didn't notice the giant walking cactus until it was too late.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is surprised that the cactus is following them, even though she was the one who said it wouldn't need much attention. Cacti are usually seen as low-maintenance plants, so it's unexpected that this one would be following them around.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
