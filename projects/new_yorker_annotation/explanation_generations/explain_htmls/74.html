I'm also recently single.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in the context of a bombed out city, being "recently single" means that the person's significant other probably died in the bombings. The woman's casual remark highlights the disconnect between the devastation and death around them, and their own personal lives.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is unlikely that two people who are "recently single" would just happen to meet in the middle of a wasteland. The joke has a double meaning: first, that the two people are single and thus available to date each other, and second, that they are both "single" because they are the only people around in this desolate place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people sitting on the bench are in the middle of a wasteland, which is not usually considered a romantic setting. However, the fact that they are both recently single implies that they might be interested in starting a relationship, which makes the setting a bit more romantic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people who are "recently single" are in the middle of what looks like the aftermath of a nuclear war. It's a dark joke because the implication is that they are the only two people left in the world, and so they might as well get together. But, of course, if they are the only two people left in the world, it's not really a coincidence that they are both single.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is sitting on a "stone" which is another word for a bench. The man is saying that it's a coincidence that they're both single and sitting on a bench. However, the woman is actually sitting on a literal stone, not a bench, which makes the man's comment even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is talking about how the city being in ruins is a terrible thing, while the man is trying to make a joke about being single. The two things are completely unrelated, yet the man is trying to find a way to turn the conversation into something positive for him. This is funny because it's a completely inappropriate thing to do in the middle of a disaster.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man and woman are sitting on a bench in a destroyed city, and yet they are both still dressed nicely and appear to be unbothered by the destruction. The fact that they are both single add another layer of irony to the joke, as it's a play on the phrase "What a coincidence" which is often used when two people have something in common. In this case, the man and woman have the commonality of being single, but it's not a happy coincidence as they are both surrounded by destruction.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's comment is a non sequitur: the man's being recently single has nothing to do with why they are sitting in the rubble of a city. In the context of a city that has just been bombed, the woman's comment takes on a darkly humorous meaning: the fact that they are both recently single is a coincidence, but the fact that the city has been bombed is not.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected. In a normal, everyday scenario, two people sitting on a bench together would probably not talk about their relationship status. However, in this desolate wasteland, it's a surprisingly normal thing to do, which makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the midst of all the destruction, the two people sitting on the bench are normal and still looking for love. The joke is also funny because, even though they are the only people around for miles, it's still a coincidence that they are both single.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Single" can mean "not married" or "alone." In this case, the woman dressed up in fancy clothes is saying that she's "single" as in "alone," meaning that she doesn't have a partner with her in the wasteland. But the man misinterprets this to mean that she's "single" as in "not married," and so he tries to hit on her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people meeting in the wasteland are both recently single, and they find that to be a delightful coincidence. This is unusual because, usually, people meeting in a wasteland would have more pressing concerns than their relationship status. However, given the state of the city in the background, it's possible that they are the only two people left, which would make their relationship status more significant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "coincidence" is often used when two people have something in common, like being from the same place or being the same age. However, in this context, the coincidence is that they are both single because their partners have been killed in the bombing. The joke is dark because it is a reality for many people in the world who have lost loved ones to violence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man and woman are sitting in the ruins of a city that has been bombed, and yet, they are completely nonchalant about the destruction around them. They are also both singles, which the man sees as a delightful coincidence. This is funny because, in the midst of all this destruction, the only thing the man can think about is finding a new partner.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually when people have a lot in common, it's a good thing, but in this case, the two people have the commonality of being recently single because their significant others have died in the explosion. This is a dark joke that uses the contrast between the normalcy of the situation and the tragedy of the event to make it funny.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="73.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="75.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
