This is absurd because, while being naked and intimate with each other may help the couple to resolve their issues, it's not likely that the act of getting naked and jumping into a fish tank would have any positive effect whatsoever.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the counselor's suggestion is so unexpected and out-of-the-box that it's absurd. It's also funny because it's a play on the common idiom "to make something work," as in, to put in the effort to make something successful. In this case, the therapist is telling the couple that they need to work on their marriage by literally jumping into a fish tank and getting naked.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the counselor's over-the-top gesture towards the fish tank --- which, again, is empty --- suggests that he is suggesting that the couple get naked and jump in, in order to Save Their Marriage(tm). This is, of course, a silly and impractical solution, which is why it's funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "jump in and make this work." Instead of suggesting that the couple work harder on their marriage, the counselor is suggesting that they strip down naked and jump into the fish tank. This is absurd because it's not clear how getting naked and into a fish tank would help their marriage.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the counselor's solution to the couple's marital problems is extreme and unexpected. The fish tank is usually seen as a calming presence in a room, but the counselor's suggestion is decidedly not calming. In addition, the nakedness adds a level of vulnerability and intimacy that is usually not present in marriage counseling, further heightening the contrast between the expected and the reality.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it appears that the counselor is suggesting that the couple get naked and jump into the fish tank in order to "make their marriage work." This is silly because jumping into an empty fish tank is not going to magically fix all of the problems in a relationship. Furthermore, there's no need to be naked to jump into a fish tank, which makes the counselor's suggestion even more absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non-sequitur: the marriage counselor's advice to "get naked, jump in, and make this marriage work" has nothing to do with the problem at hand, which is that the couple is not communicating. The idea that the counselor would suggest such a drastic and seemingly unrelated solution is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the counselor's proposed solution to the couple's marital problems is unorthodox, to say the least. It is also humorous because it is an exaggeration of something that some marriage counselors may actually suggest, which is to try and make the relationship work by communicating more with each other.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while getting naked and jumping into a fishless fish tank may be a silly and weird activity to do, it's not obviously related to fixing a marriage. The joke suggests that the counselor is either incompetent or doesn't understand the complexities of marriage, leading the couple to believe that his proposed solution is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the counselor's suggestion is both nonsensical and inappropriate. It's nonsensical because, while being in an aquarium with fish can be calming, being in an aquarium by yourself would be boring and lonely. It's inappropriate because the counselor is suggesting that the couple get naked and jump into the fish tank in front of him, which is clearly sexual harassment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the counselor is telling the couple to get naked and jump into the fish tank in order to save their marriage. This is absurd because there is no way that getting naked and jumping into a fish tank would help a marriage, and in fact, it would probably make things worse.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non-traditional solution to the couple's marriage problems. The Counselor is telling them to get naked and jump in the fish tank, which is usually where one puts fish, not people. This suggests that the counselor is suggesting something that is at odds with what is traditionally done to "fix" a marriage.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while getting naked and jumping in water is often used as a metaphor for "jumping in headfirst" to something new/difficult, in this context, the counselor is being literal and suggesting that the couple get naked and jump into the fish tank in order to work on their marriage. This is absurd because it's unclear how getting naked and into a fish tank would help save their marriage.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man and woman are in a therapist's office, and the therapist is telling them to get naked and jump into the fish tank. The fish tank is empty, so the therapist is telling them to "make this marriage work" by filling the tank with their bodies. This is a humorous way of telling the couple that they need to work on their relationship.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "to jump ship," which means to abandon something (like a marriage) when it becomes difficult. In this case, the counselor is suggesting that the solution to their marriage problems is to "jump in" the fish tank, which is a play on the phrase, but also would be a very strange and unhelpful thing to do.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
