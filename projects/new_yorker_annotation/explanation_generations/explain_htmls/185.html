The deer are looking at a "deer crossing" sign, which is a warning to drivers to be aware of deer on the road. The joke is that the person telling the joke is literal-minded, and they think that the deer are looking at the sign because they are impressed by the exhibit of headlights in the next room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common trope of art lovers admiring "modern art" that is actually quite simple or even mundane. The art in this scenario is simply road signs, which are not normally considered high art. However, the deer are probably mesmerized by the headlight exhibit because they are drawn to the light, which would help them see at night while they are crossing the road.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because deer are often associated with being hit by cars, and the images on the road signs are of deer being hit by cars. The deer in the gallery are admiring the road signs, and the joke is that they find them mesmerizing. This is a play on the fact that people often find things that are gruesome or disturbing to be fascinating.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The deer are looking at "deer" signs, which are road signs that warn drivers of the presence of deer on or near the road. The joke is that the deer are so mesmerized by the headlights exhibit (which warning drivers of the presence of deer on or near the road), that they don't even notice the room full of actual deer signs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is play on the fact that deer are often struck by cars because they are attracted to the headlights of oncoming vehicles. In this case, the deer are in a room full of headlights, and the exhibit is not what they were expecting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are in a room full of road signs, which are meant for drivers to see, not for deer to appreciate as art. The deer are being told to go to the next room to see the headlight exhibit, which is just a bunch of headlights, which would be very uninteresting to deer (and to most people).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are looking at traffic signs, which are meant for drivers to help them navigate the road. The museum is likely to have an exhibit on headlights, which would be much more relevant and interesting for deer, since they need them to see at night. However, the joke is that the deer are looking at the wrong exhibit, and the exhibit on headlights is just for humans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are looking at a traffic sign that says "deer crossing." The person who is presumably giving them a tour of the museum is telling them that the next exhibit is even better, without realizing that the deer are confused by the sign. The joke is a play on the fact that deer are often struck by cars because they don't understand traffic signs, and the museum tour guide is making a joke that is likely to go over their heads.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is absurd that deer would go to an art gallery to look at deer signs. This is made even more absurd by the fact that the deer are walking on their hind legs and are thus able to appreciate the art. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words: the deer are looking at "deer signs" but the next exhibit is of "headlights."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the deer are looking at road signs, which are often in the shape of a deer's head, so the art gallery has an exhibit of headlight deer signs. This is humorous because it's a clever play on words, and also because the deer are not actually going to be able to appreciate the beauty of the artwork in the way that humans would.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is unexpected that the deer would be interested in road signs. The deer are Walk-ing on their hind legs, which implies they are trying to be more like humans. The gallery attendant's comment about the next exhibit being even more interesting for the deer is sarcastic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The deer are looking at signs that say "deer crossing" and the person making the joke is saying that the deer will love the next exhibit, which is about headlights. The word "deer" can be pronounced like the word "dear," which means the joke is also about how the deer are confused about the signs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the common trope of animals being stupid. The deer are admiring road signs, which are meant for human drivers, not animals. The joke is also clever because the word "mesmerizing" can mean both "fascinating" and "hypnotic"; in this case, it's a pun because the deer are literally mesmerized by the road signs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the stereotype of deer being easily startled by headlights. In this context, the deer are in a museum looking at exhibits of deer crossing signs, and the joke is that the deer are so mesmerized by the exhibit of headlights that they fail to realize that they are the exhibit.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, although the deer are admiring the traffic signs, they are not able to appreciate the more nuanced artwork in the museum, like the headlight exhibit. The deer are only focused on the literal meaning of the signs, not the artistry.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="184.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="186.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
