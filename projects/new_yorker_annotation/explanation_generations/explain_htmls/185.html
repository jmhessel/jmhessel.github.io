The editor is literally asking what planet the author is from, since he doesn't understand the humor, but the author could also be from a different planet in the sense that he doesn't understand what would be funny to Earthlings. In either case, the disparity in understanding is what makes the joke humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while cartoons can be enjoyed by people of all ages, the content of this particular cartoon is quite juvenile and sophomoric. It's likely that the author of the cartoon is not from Earth, hence the editor's question. The joke implies that aliens have a very different sense of humor from humans, which is why this particular cartoon would not be funny to humans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The editor is asking the author of the cartoon which "planet" they were on when they thought of the idea for the cartoon. This is a way of saying that the idea is not good, and that the author is not thinking straight.
