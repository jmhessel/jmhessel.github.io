The word "conflicted" can mean both that the person is experiencing inner turmoil and that the person is physically unable to move. In this case, the therapist is telling the man that although he will still be experiencing conflict, he will at least smell better after the therapy session.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the tub is in therapy because he is conflicted about something, and the therapist is telling him that taking a bath won't resolve his conflict, but it will make him smell better. This is a clever way of saying that the man will still have the same problems after his therapy session, but at least he'll be clean.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man watching the other man in the bathtub is a therapist, and he's telling him that even though he may not feel any better after his therapy session, he will at least smell better because he's in the bathtub. This is a play on the fact that often times people feel better after they take a bath, even if their problems are still unresolved.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "you'll still be conflicted" means that the person will still have the same psychological issues that they came to therapy for. However, the word "conflicted" can also mean "clogged," as in a clogged drain. So, the joke is that the person will still have the same psychological issues, but at least they will smell better after taking a bath.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the bathtub is clearly conflicted about something, and the therapist is telling him that even if he goes through with therapy, he'll still have the same conflicts. However, the therapist then says that he'll at least smell better, implying that the man in the bathtub smells bad.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In this context, "conflicted" means having emotional or mental conflict, i.e., being in turmoil. However, the other meaning of "conflicted" is to be in physical conflict, which is what the man in the bathtub is likely to be if the other man continues to brush his hair.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's true that therapy can help you work through your conflict and improve your life, but it won't necessarily make you smell better. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the man in the bathtub is in a "conflicted" state, but after therapy, he'll just be "conflicted" (i.e., he'll still have the same problem, but he'll feel better about it). And, of course, the man in the bathtub will literally smell better after he takes a bath.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the image of a patient laying in a bathtub in a psychiatrists office is incongruous. The joke then pokes fun at the efficacy of therapy, suggesting that it won't actually fix the patient's problems, but it might make them smell better.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In this context, "conflicted" means having mixed or opposing emotions, desires, etc. However, the word can also be used as a synonym for "clogged," as in a clogged sink or bathtub. Thus, the joke is saying that even though therapy might not "fix" the man's emotional conflict, it will at least "unclog" him, i.e., make him feel better.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in addition to the expected benefits of therapy ( feeling better emotionally), the man will also benefit from therapy by smelling better. This is because he is taking a bath in the therapist's office, which presumably he wouldn't have been able to do at home, and thus his hygiene has improved.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the bathtub is clearly conflicted about something, and the man on the couch is his therapist. The therapist is telling him that even though he'll still be conflicted, at least he'll smell better if he takes a bath. However, the therapist could also be saying that he'll be Conflict-ed (i.e., have the conflict resolution software program) if he takes a bath.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The therapist is saying that even though the patient will still have the same conflict after therapy, at least they will smell better. This is funny because it's a non-sequitur; the two things are unrelated.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the idea of being in a bathtub during a therapy session is bizarre and unexpected. It's also funny because it points out the potential ineffectiveness of therapy: even though the patient will smell better, they will still be conflicted.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's euphemistic. The man in the bathtub is clearly very upset and the therapist is trying to calm him down by saying that even though he'll still have his conflict, he'll at least smell better. This is a roundabout way of saying that the man will feel better after taking a bath, even though his underlying conflict will still be there.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the brush is a therapist, and he's telling the man in the bathtub that even though he'll still have the same issues, he'll at least smell better after his session. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the man in the tub is "in conflict," but he'll also be "conflicted" after his therapy session.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
