It looks like they fixed the copier.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men coming into the room are clones, and they were created by a copy machine. The woman on the phone was staring at them because they were so unusual, but she realized that they were just copies of the original man. This joke makes a play on words because the clones are copies, and they were created by a copy machine.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it references a common office annoyance, when the copier breaks and everyone has to wait in line to use it. However, the fact that there are dozens of clones of the same man suggests that something much more serious is going on than a broken copier. The joke is that the woman is so used to the annoyance of the broken copier that she doesn't even bat an eye at the clones, and just assumes that it's been fixed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is mistakenly thinking that the men are clones, when they are just regular people who happen to look the same. The joke is also a play on the fact that often times when something goes wrong at work, the first thing people think is that the copier is broken. However, in this case, the copier working is what caused the problem.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is on the phone with someone, and she is distracted by the men who look the same. She is trying to figure out why there are so many men who look the same, and she comes to the conclusion that they "fixed the copier." This is a play on the fact that copy machines often make copies of documents that are not perfect, and sometimes the copies look like the original but with some slight changes. In this case, the copy machine has made perfect copies of the men, leading to the unusual situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "copier" can refer to either a machine that copies documents, or (in this case) a person who copies others. Thus, the woman's confused reaction is because she thinks the copier machine has malfunctioned and made a dozen exact copies of the same document. However, the punchline reveals that the copier machine is actually the group of identical men, who have been clone. This is a humorous reveal because it means that the woman has been staring at the group of men for some time, not realizing that they are all clones.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation with the clone men is so unexpected and strange that it could be explained away by a mundane office machine like a copy machine. The fact that the woman on the phone is so nonchalant about the scene also adds to the humor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the absurd number of clones, which is clearly not possible. The woman's reaction is also funny because it's a common reaction to seeing something that's so unbelievable. In this case, the joke is a play on words because the clones are actually copies of the original person, not photocopies.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman on the phone is talking to someone about the unusual event she's witnessing, of a dozen or more people who look exactly the same, but she's interrupted by the realization that they're not clones, they're just people who were using the office copier and are now leaving. The joke is a play on the fact that, while human cloning is technically possible, it's very unlikely to happen on such a large scale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's shocked reaction to the dozens of clones implies that this is an abnormal situation, when in reality, it is just a group of people who happen to look alike. The punchline implies that the cloning machine (i.e., the copier) has been fixed, and therefore, the group of clones is no longer anything to be alarmed about.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the sight of so many clones would be quite unusual in an office setting. Most office workers have their own individual looks, so to see a dozen or more people who look exactly the same would be quite a shock. Moreover, the fact that the woman on the phone seems unsurprised by the clones suggests that this is a common occurrence, which is even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the woman on the phone was discussing the malfunctioning copier with someone, and the men exiting the room are actually clones created by the copier. The copier malfunctioned in a way that created an army of clones, which is strange and unexpected. The joke is a play on the fact that often, when something goes wrong at work, someone will say "Never mind, they fixed it" even if the problem wasn't actually fixed, just to move on. In this case, the woman on the phone is saying "Never mind" because the problem (the copier) was actually fixed, but in a way that is much stranger and more unexpected than she could have ever anticipated.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is shocked because she sees so many identical people, and she thinks they are clones. However, the clones are actually just copies of the same person, produced by a copier machine. So, the woman's shock is unfounded, and she can just go back to her office and continue her work.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Copier" can refer to both a machine that copies documents, and a person who copies another person. In this case, the woman is shocked because she sees so many clones, but the clones are actually just the result of a malfunctioning copier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the men are clones that were created by a copier machine, which would be a very inefficient way to create clones. Furthermore, the woman's shocked reaction is likely due to the fact that she's never seen so many clones in one place before, and it's a bit bewildering.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the scene is reminiscent of a scene in a movie or tv show where there has been a mistake made with a cloning machine, and a bunch of clones have been created. In this case, the woman on the phone is probably the office manager or some other authority figure, and she's surprised that the copier has made so many copies of the same person. The joke is a play on words, because the word "copier" can refer to both a machine that makes copies of documents, and a person who makes copies of something (in this case, themselves).</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="112.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="114.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
