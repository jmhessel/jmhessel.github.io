The father is playing the electric guitar in a way that is not typical for someone of his generation, thus the joke. Additionally, the joke could be funny because the father is playing the electric guitar so badly that it sounds like he's just trying to be "cool" and "hip" by playing an electric guitar.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is playing the electric guitar so quickly that it is clear he does not know how to play it. The joke is a play on the fact that older generations often criticize younger generations for not being able to do things the "right" way, even though the older generation is not familiar with the newer way of doing things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the stereotype that older people do not understand the music of younger people. In this case, the joke is literal: the man's arm is actually falling off because he is playing the electric guitar so fast. This would be impossible for someone of any age to do, let alone an older person.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="169.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="171.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
