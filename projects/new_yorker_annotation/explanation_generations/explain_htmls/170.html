This is a back-handed compliment, as he is implying she is overweight, but is trying to be polite about it. In the context of the wiki/Victorian_era, this is also a funny comment because corsets were often used to artificially make waists look smaller, so the man's comment about the ruff has a double meaning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Victorian era was known for its extremely constrictive fashion for women, which often included ridiculously large collars that covered half the woman's face. The joke here is that while the collar may make the woman's waist look smaller, it's at the expense of her being able to see and breathe properly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Ruff was a type of collar worn during the Victorian era that was incredibly large. The fact that one of the men comments on her waist looking smaller is humorous because it's such a minor detail in the grand scheme of things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The ruff around the woman's neck makes her look like she has a small waist, but the word "ruff" can also mean "trouble" or "difficulty". So, the joke is that the woman's large neck frill is not only unattractive, but it's also causing her some difficulty.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "ruff" can mean either a type of collar worn in the Victorian era or a disturbance or commotion. In this case, the joke is that the huge collar is causing a disturbance, or "ruffling" the men's feathers. Furthermore, the fact that the collar makes the woman's waist look smaller is an added bonus, since smaller waists were considered desirable in the Victorian era.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The Ruff was a neckpiece worn in the Victorian era that was often very large and circle-shaped. The joke is that the man says it makes her waist look smaller, which is something that people often say about clothing that is tight around the waist, but in this case, the opposite is true.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that during the Victorian era, women's clothing was very constrictive and often times uncomfortable. The fact that the woman's collar is so large that it covers half her face is a commentary on how ridiculously uncomfortable and impractical the clothing was. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the fact that people often comment on women's clothing as a way to objectify them. In this case, the man is commenting on the woman's clothing as a way to make a crude joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man says that the ruff (a type of collar worn in the 16th century) makes the woman's waist look smaller, but he could also be saying that the ruff makes her "waste" (i.e., her person) look smaller. In other words, he's saying that she's not worth his time or attention.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The large object around the woman's neck is called a "ruff," which is also a type of clothing worn in the 16th century. The joke is poking fun at the fact that the woman is wearing a ruff, which was considered to be a fashion faux pas.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the gentleman speaking is likely making a backhanded compliment about the woman's appearance. He is acknowledging that the ruff makes her look smaller, but he is implying that she is so large that she needs something to make her look smaller.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The huge collar is called a ruff, which is also a type of bird. The man's comment is clever because it is true that the collar makes the woman's waist look smaller, but it is also a pun on the fact that the collar is literally a ruff.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non-sequitur. The man's comment about the woman's collar making her waist look smaller does not follow from the previous statement about the unusual size of her collar. In addition, the comment is absurd because it is not true: the collar actually makes her waist look bigger because it is so big.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words; the medieval clothing item around the woman's neck is called a "ruff", and the man is making a pun by saying that it also makes her waist look "smaller". This is a clever play on words because it's not something that would normally be said about a ruff.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's waist looks smaller because her neck is so large. The Ruff was a fashion item in the Victorian era that was worn around the neck, often to make the wearer's head look larger. In this case, the joke is that the woman's neck is so large that it makes her waist look smaller in comparison.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is true that the object around the woman's neck does make her waist look smaller by comparison. However, the object is so large and attention-grabbing that it makes her look ridiculous, and the joke is poking fun at that.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="169.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="171.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
