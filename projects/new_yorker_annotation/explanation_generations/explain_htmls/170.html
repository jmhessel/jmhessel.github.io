The joke is also a play on words, as the phrase "long bike ride" can mean either a bike ride that is physically long, or a bike ride that takes a long time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. When the woman said she wanted to go on a long bike ride, the man thought she meant that she wanted to ride on a bike that was extremely long, when in reality, she just meant that she wanted to go on a long bike ride with him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of the word "long": in this case, the word can refer to either the length of the bike ride or to the fact that the bike is unusually long (a tandem bicycle). The woman in the joke thought her husband meant the latter, when in fact, he meant the former.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who thought they were going on a long bike ride likely expected to go on a leisurely journey with their partner, but instead, ended up having to do all the work to pedal the bike while their partner just sat there and enjoyed the ride.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people are on a very long bike ride, but they are not actually going anywhere because they are both on their phones and not pedaling. The joke is a play on words because the two people are on a long bike ride, but they are not actually doing anything.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The person who made the joke misunderstood their friend's request for a long bike ride to mean that they wanted to ride a bike that was very long. The joke is also clever because it's a visual pun; the bike is actually very long, but it's not what the person who made the joke expected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man misunderstood when the woman said she wanted to go on a "long bike ride." He thought she meant a bike ride that was long in distance, when she actually meant a bike ride that was long in duration. This is a play on words because the two words sound similar but have different meanings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people on the phone are having a conversation about something else (unrelated to the bike ride) while they are on the bike ride. The fact that they are on a long bike ride is a non-sequitur.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people seem to be on a date, but they are both clearly more interested in their phones than each other. The fact that they are on a tandem bike, which is typically ridden by people who know each other well, emphasizes the disconnect between the two of them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman said she wanted a "long bike ride" and the man interpreted that to mean a bike that was physically long, rather than a bike ride that would last a long time. The contrast between the two interpretations is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person misunderstood their partner when they said they wanted to go on a "long bike ride." The person assumed that their partner meant they wanted to go on a bike ride that was physically long, when in fact, their partner meant they wanted to ride a bike that was long. This is a play on words, as the two phrases have similar meaning, but are not the same thing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bike is so long that it's impossible to ride it without someone else. The joke is also a play on words, because the person who thought they were going on a long bike ride probably misunderstood when the other person said they wanted to go on a "long" bike ride.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people are on a very long bike ride, much longer than either of them anticipated. The joke is also clever because it is a play on words; the long bike ride is literal, but it is also a metaphor for the length of the relationship between the two people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who made the joke thought they were going to go on a long individual bike ride, but the other person tricked them by taking them on a tandem bike ride instead. This is a play on words, as the word "ride" can mean both the activity of biking, as well as a term for romantic/sexual intercourse.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the phrase "long bike ride" is often used colloquially to mean a leisurely activity that two people can do together, but in this case, the bike ride is much longer than anticipated because it's stretched out. The joke is clever because it's a play on words.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="169.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="171.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
