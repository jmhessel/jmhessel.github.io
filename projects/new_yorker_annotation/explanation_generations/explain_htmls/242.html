The snowman is "frosty," which can mean either that he's made of snow, or that he's unfriendly. In this case, it's a pun because the snowman is both literally and figuratively frosty.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The snowman is "frosty" which can mean two things: 1) the snowman is made of frost, or 2) the snowman is unfriendly. In this case, it's implied that the snowman is unfriendly because he's staring at the women, and the women are retail clerks, so they're used to being stared at by men. The joke is that the snowman is rude because he's staring at the women, but it's not because he's attracted to them, it's just because he's made of snow.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common phrase "he's just not that into you". In this case, the snowman is not being frosty to the women because he dislikes them particularly, but because he is literally made of frost and snow, and so he is frosty to everyone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snowman is staring at the women, making them feel uncomfortable. One woman tries to brush it off by saying that the snowman is just frosty to everyone, meaning that he's not singling them out --- but this backfires, as now the other woman knows that she's not the only one who the snowman is giving a creepy stare.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "frosty" can mean two things: first, it can describe the temperature, i.e. "cold." Second, it can describe someone who is unfriendly or aloof. In this case, the frosty person is literally a snowman, who is made of frost, or ice. The joke is clever because it is both a pun and a metaphor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "frosty" is a common adjective used to describe someone who is unfriendly, but in this case, it is literally true: the snowman is made of frost, and so he is frosty to everyone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snowman is being rude to the people in the store, and they are making excuses for him. Frosty is a common nickname for people who are rude, and so the snowman's behavior is being attributed to his name.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a common reason for people to be unfriendly or "frosty" is because they don't like the person they are interacting with. However, in this case, the snowman is literally frosty because he is made of snow. The joke plays on the ambiguity of the word "frosty" to be either unfriendly or literally covered in frost.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The term "frosty" can describe someone who is unfriendly and cold, or it can describe the literal frost that covers a snowman. In this case, the snowman is frosty in both senses of the word: he is covered in frost, and he is being unfriendly to the retail clerks.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snowman is staring at the women, and the speaker says it's not because they're attractive, but because he's "frosty to everyone." The word "frosty" has a few meanings, one of which is "cold and unfriendly." So the joke is that the snowman is staring because he's cold and unfriendly, not because he's attracted to the women.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the stereotype that people who work in customer service are always nice to customers, no matter how rude or unruly they are. However, in this case, the customer is a snowman, who is naturally frosty, and so the employees' frostiness towards him is warranted.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The snowman is "frosty," meaning he's made of snow, but he's also unfriendly, or "frosty," to everyone he meets.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "frosty" can refer to both the weather condition "frozen" and the social condition "unfriendly". Therefore, the joke is that the snowman is behaving in a chilly manner because he is, in fact, made of snow.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the co-workers is trying to make an excuse for the snowman's behavior, acting like he's just unfriendly to her, when really, he's an inanimate object. The joke is a play on the phrase "he's just not that into you," which is often used to explain away a man's disinterest in a woman.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="241.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="243.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
