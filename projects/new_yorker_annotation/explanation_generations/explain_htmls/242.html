The person who made the joke is casually warning the other about the dangers of artificial sweetener, as if that is the more pressing concern at the moment, rather than the cinder block that is about to hit the man.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because even though the man is about to be hit in the head by a cement block, his friend seems more concerned with the fact that he's using artificial sweetener in his drink. The artificial sweetener is not going to kill him, but the cement block might. This comment is sarcastic and shows how little concern the friend has for the man's well-being.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's companion is in danger of being killed by a falling cinder block, and yet the man is more concerned with the long-term health effects of the artificial sweetener his companion is using. This is a non-sequitur because the artificial sweetener will not kill the man's companion instantaneously like the cinder block will, and so it's not really relevant to the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because even though the man is about to be killed by a cinderblock, his wife remains unconcerned and instead tries to tell him that artificial sweetener is bad for him. This is a contrast because the artificial sweetener is not going to kill him, but the cinderblock is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is about to be killed by a cinderblock, yet his wife is more concerned about him using artificial sweetener in his coffee. This is a play on the fact that artificial sweetener is often considered to be dangerous, even though it is much less so than other things (like cinderblocks).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the men is about to be killed by a cinder block falling on his head, but the other man is more concerned with the fact that his companion is eating food with artificial sweetener in it. This is because, while artificial sweetener is often demonized as being unhealthy, it is not actually known to be dangerous, whereas a cinder block falling on your head is definitely dangerous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is about to be killed by a cinderblock, but the woman doesn't seem to care and is more concerned with the fact that he's using artificial sweetener. This joke makes light of the fact that people often worry about trivial things, even when there is a more pressing matter at hand.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected. The woman is warning her husband about the dangers of artificial sweetener, but he is completely unaware of the imminent danger. This juxtaposition is humorous because it's unexpected and because the woman's warning is completely unrelated to the danger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is about to be hit by a cement block, and the woman is telling him that the artificial sweetener in his coffee will kill him. This is funny because the artificial sweetener is not going to kill him; the cement block is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the idea that concrete is often used as a weapon. In this case, the woman is able to warn her companion about the impending danger, but her comment about artificial sweetener is a non-sequitur.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man about to be killed by the cinderblock is being given a reason why he is going to die that is unrelated to the danger he is actually in. The artificial sweetener might have long-term effects that are harmful, but it is not going to kill the man instantly like the cinderblock will.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is about to be killed by a cinderblock, yet his wife is more worried about the health effects of the artificial sweetener in his coffee. This shows a lack of priorities, as the artificial sweetener is not going to kill him, but the cinderblock is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of the word "kill": in a normal scenario, to "kill" someone would be to murder them; however, in this context, to "kill" someone would be to cement block them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who is about to be hit by the cinderblock is being given a warning about the dangers of artificial sweetener, as if that is the more pressing concern at the moment. It's a non-sequitur that is humorous because it's unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is talking about how the artificial sweetener in the man's coffee will kill him, but the real threat is the cinderblock that is about to hit him. This is a play on words, as the word "kill" can mean both to murder someone and to destroy something.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="241.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="243.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
