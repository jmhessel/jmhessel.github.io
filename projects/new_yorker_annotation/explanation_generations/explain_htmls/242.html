The joke suggests that the man in the limo is trying to take advantage of the caveman by sells him a diet plan, which is something that is common in the modern world.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the limo is trying to sell the caveman on the idea of a "paleo diet", which is a modern diet that people believe is based on the diets of cavemen. However, the man in the limo is clearly not a caveman himself, so he is trying to sell the diet to the caveman as if it's a new, modern invention.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that cavemen were simple-minded and only concerned with basic needs like food and shelter.
