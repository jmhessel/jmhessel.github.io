The joke suggests that the ideas for the meeting came from children, who would be more likely to want to roast marshmallows than sit in a boring meeting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "bring your child to work day" is a day where parents bring their young children to their place of work so they can see what their parent does. However, in this case, the "children" are the marshmallows, which are being brought to the "work" (the fire) and roasted. The joke is clever because it's a literal interpretation of the phrase "bring your child to work day."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of the word "ideas": in a corporate meeting, "ideas" typically refers to business ideas, but in this case, the "ideas" are the marshmallows that the men are roasting. The joke is clever because it's a play on words that is also a visual pun.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="180.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="182.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
