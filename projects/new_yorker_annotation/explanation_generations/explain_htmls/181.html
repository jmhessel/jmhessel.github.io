In this case, the man who emerged from the window is telling them that the rioters are burning down the cathedral, which is a very unexpected thing to say given the context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it subverts the expectations set up by the "three X walk into a bar" joke format. In that type of joke, the punchline is usually something absurd or unexpected happening to the group, but in this case, the punchline is that something serious is happening and they need to go deal with it. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the "rioters" are actually at the cathedral, burning it down, so the firefighter will need to put out the fire.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who just emerged from the building is telling them about the rioting going on, and the three men–a policeman, a priest, and a firefighter–are hesitant to leave because they are in the middle of what appears to be a very serious discussion. The joke is a play on the fact that these three people would normally be very interested in stopping a fire at a cathedral, but the context of the situation makes it humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the classic "three X walk into a bar" joke format. In this situation, instead of a bar, the three people are on the side of a building, and the man emerging from the window is telling them about the rioters burning down the cathedral. The joke is clever because it turns a classic joke format on its head.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is telling them about the rioters burning down the cathedral is interrupting their conversation. It's also funny because the three people he's interrupting are a firefighter, a policeman, and a priest. These are all people who would typically be involved in putting out a fire or stopping a riot, but they are instead just standing on the side of a building chatting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man interrupts the three people who are (presumably) about to jump off the building by telling them about the rioters and the cathedral. The man's delivery implies that he expects them to care about the cathedral burning down, even though they are in the middle of a suicide pact. The situation is made even funnier by the fact that the man is interrupted by a fourth person, who tells him that the cathedral is already burned down.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it is a very bad time for the man to be telling them (the policeman, priest, and firefighter) that the rioters are burning down the cathedral, it is also a very bad time for the rioters to be burning down the cathedral. The cathedral is a sacred and important place, and it wouldn't be burning down if it wasn't for the rioters in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the classic "three X walk into a bar" joke formula. In this case, instead of walking into a bar, the three people are on the side of a building. And instead of the punchline being a funny statement or event, it's a serious statement about a riot.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it addresses the incongruity of the situation: these three people, who have very different jobs, are standing on the side of a building together. The joke is a play on words, because the man who came out of the window says that the "rioters are burning down the cathedral." In a literal sense, he's talking about a physical cathedral that is on fire, but he could also be talking about the cathedral of their city, which is in ruins.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common bar joke format, but with an unexpected twist. In a "three X walk into a bar" joke, X is usually replaced with some sort of occupation, like " three priests walk into a bar." The punchline is usually some sort of play on words related to the occupation, like "do you know what I call a priest in a bar? Father!" In this case, the punchline is unexpectedly grim: the cathedral is burning down, and the rioters are to blame. The joke is funny because it's a dark twist on a familiar format.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the classic "three guys walk into a bar" joke format. In this case, the three people are a firefighter, a policeman, and a priest, and the joke is that they are so busy talking to each other that they don't realize that the cathedral is on fire. This is a play on the fact that these three professions are often at odds with each other.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who has just spoken to the three people on the side of the building is telling them about the rioters burning down the cathedral. This is significant because the policeman, priest, and firefighter are all people who would normally be called upon to help in a situation like this, but they are all currently preoccupied. The joke plays on the idea that people in professions that help others are often too busy to actually help when they are needed the most.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "cathedral" can refer to either a Christian church or the central part of a town or city. In this case, the man on the ledge is telling the others that the rioters are burning down the city center, which is not a good time for them. This is a play on the fact that often, "not a good time" is used to politely decline invitations or requests.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the classic "three X walk into a bar" joke format. In this case, the three people are a policeman, a priest, and a firefighter, which are all people who would normally be called on to deal with a riot. However, the man who comes to speak to them tells them that the rioters are burning down the cathedral, which is not something that any of them would be able to do anything about. It's a joke about the futility of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the situation: although it's not unheard of for a police officer, a firefighter, and a priest to be in the same place (e.g. at the scene of an emergency), it is strange for them to be standing on the ledge of a building together. The man's exclamation about the rioters adds to the absurdist humor of the situation.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
