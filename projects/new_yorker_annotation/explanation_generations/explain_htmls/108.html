In this case, the birds are eating the seed money, which is preventing the company from growing. This joke also highlights the absurdity of having birds in an office, which is what makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the idiom "to kill the golden goose." The idiom means to ruin something that was previously profitable, and the joke is that the birds are eating the seed money, which will prevent them from being able to grow and thrive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "stop eating the seed money" means to stop spending money on things that are not essential to the business, in order to save money. However, in this case, the "seed money" is literal bird seed, which the parrots are eating. This is silly because, of course, parrots need to eat bird seed, and so they can't stop eating it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "we have to stop eating the seed corn", which means that a company is sacrificing future growth for current gain. However, in this scene, the birds are actually eating seed, which is what corn comes from. This joke implies that the company is not just sacrificing future growth, but is actually devouring its own potential.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "eating the seed money", which means to spend money on something unnecessary, thus hindering the growth/progress of a project/company. In this case, the joke is that the parrots are actually eating the seed money, which is both unnecessary and counterproductive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idiom "to kill the goose that lays the golden egg." The idiom means to ruin something that is good for you, usually by greedily trying to get more of it. In this case, the birds are ruining their chances of getting more seed money by eating the seed money that they already have.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the parrots are saying something that is usually attributed to humans (or human-like figures, like animals that have been anthropomorphized). The phrase "eating the seed money" means to use up all the money that was meant to be used for investing or other growth, which would stunt the growth of the company. However, in this context, it's funny because the parrots are the ones saying it and they are the ones eating the seed money.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "stop eating" is often used as a way of telling someone to stop doing something that they enjoy, but in this case it's literal --- the parrots are eating the seed money, which is preventing the company from growing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the birds are in a room that they shouldn't be in (an office), and they are doing something that they shouldn't be doing (eating seed money). The fact that they are eating seed money is also a play on the phrase "killing the golden goose," meaning to do something that ruins a good thing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "eating the seed money" is usually used to describe a business investing money into something that will not have a return for some time, in order to grow the business. However, in this context, the phrase takes on a literal meaning, as the parrots are eating the seed that was meant to grow the business.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "eating the seed money", which means to spend the money that is meant to be invested. In this case, the seed money is actual bird seed, and the joke is that the parrots are eating the food that is meant to sustain them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "eating the seed money", which means to spend the money that is supposed to be used to grow a business. The joke is made funnier by the fact that the seed money is being eaten by literal parrots, which are also a common business mascot.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully mocks the business jargon that is often used in office settings. In this case, the "seed money" refers to the money that is used to start a new business venture, and by "eating" it, the parrots are saying that they are spending it all rather than investing it. This is a play on the fact that parrots are often used as symbols of greed and excess.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "eating the seed money," which means to use up the money meant to generate more money, usually in business investments. In this case, the parrots are using the seed money to buy food, which means they will not have money to generate more money.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "pecking order." In a business setting, the "pecking order" is the hierarchy of who gets the blame/credit for a project. However, in this scene, the birds are actually pecking at the seed, which is a metaphor for money. The joke is clever because it's a play on words, and it's also a reference to a common saying.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="107.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="109.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
