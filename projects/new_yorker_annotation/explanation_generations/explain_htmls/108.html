In this joke, instead of draining the swamp of corrupt politicians, he has nominated a giant mosquito to be in charge of the CDC, which is responsible for combatting diseases. This is a humorous way of saying that Trump's nominees are often unqualified for their positions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that the mosquito is a disease vector, and Trump's nominee for the CDC is a doctor who has been critical of the CDC in the past. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the fact that mosquitoes are often considered to be pests, and Trump is often considered to be a pest by his critics.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that the U.S. President Donald Trump has nominated people for government positions who are unqualified for the role.
