The salesman is trying to get the couple to buy the car, and he's using a common sales tactic of asking what it would take to get them to buy the car today. In this case, the joke is that, given the car's weird appearance, it would take a lot for someone to buy it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the salesman's line is a common one used by car salesmen to pressure potential buyers into committing to a purchase. However, the fact that the car has a monster face and legs makes the salesman's line much more sinister: it's as if the salesman is saying, "What's it going to take to get you to buy this monster?"</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the salesman is trying to sell the couple a car that is literally a monster. The salesman is using a common sales tactic by asking the couple what it would take to get them to buy the car, but the fact that the car is a monster makes the situation absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple's expressions make it clear that they are not interested in the car, no matter how low the price is. The fact that the car has cat parts is weird and makes it less appealing, but the salesman is not deterred and is still trying to make a sale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The salesman is asking the couple what they will need to do in order to "get in" the car, meaning drive it off the lot. However, the couple is looking at the car with horror, and it's clear that they would never "get in" the car in the literal sense, because it would be too dangerous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the stereotype of pushy car salesmen. The salesman is trying to close the deal on the car, which is unusual because it is a monster. The joke is clever because it could be interpreted two ways: either the salesman is trying to sell the couple a car that has been turned into a monster, or the salesman is himself a monster trying to sell the couple a car.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the salesman is trying to close the deal on the car by offering a very low price, but the car is so obviously modified and not in a good way, that the couple is not interested. The joke plays on the idea that car salesmen are pushy and will do anything to make a sale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the salesman is trying to sell a car that is obviously a monster, and the potential customers are oblivious to the fact. The joke is a play on the common car dealership tactic of trying to pressure a customer into buying a car by asking them what it will take to get them to buy the car today.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the salesman is trying to sell the couple a car that is clearly a monster. The couple is probably scared of the car, and the salesman is trying to act like it's a normal car. The salesman is trying to get them to buy the car by offering a discount, but the couple is probably not going to buy it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the salesman is trying to sell the couple a car that has been modified to look like a cat, and he is acting as if it's a perfectly normal car. The joke is also a play on words, as the phrase "What's it going to take to get you in this car today?" is a common sales tactic to close a deal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The normal way to finish that sentence would be "...get you in this car today?" as in, what monthly payment would the customer be comfortable with. However, in this case, the salesman is asking what it would take for the customer to, quite literally, get into the car. This is funny because the car has no doors, and thus the only way to "get in" would be to, for example, climb through the window or jump through the sunroof.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the car is so obviously modified in a way that makes it look dangerous and not at all street legal. The couple is probably not interested in the car, but the salesman is trying to sell it to them anyway. The joke could also be interpreted as the salesman being desperate to make a sale and not caring what kind of car the couple buys, as long as he makes the commission.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The salesman is asking the couple what they would like in order to purchase the car, but the couple is thinking about what they would need in order to get INTO the car. The fact that the car is a living creature makes it even more difficult to get into, since they would need to, for example, tame it or find a way to get eaten by it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the car salesman is trying to sell a car that is clearly not a car. The man and woman are probably not interested in buying a living creature, even if it does have some features of a car. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words: the salesman is asking what it will take to get the man and woman "in" the car, but the car doesn't have any doors or windows, so it's not clear how they would get "in" it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common sales tactic of trying to get customers to buy a product by asking what it would take to get them to buy it. In this case, the salesman is literally asking what it would take to get the couple into the car, since the car has a face and legs. The joke is clever because it highlights how absurd it is to ask what it would take to get someone to buy a product --- in this case, a car with a monster face and legs.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="107.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="109.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
