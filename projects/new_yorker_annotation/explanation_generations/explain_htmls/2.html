The man has been "stabbed in the back", which is often used to describe when someone is betrayed by a friend. The man's reaction is also play on words: he is calmly talking on the phone, despite the fact that he has just been stabbed, which is not a typical reaction.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "sharp": in the context of the paper being knifed to the man's back, it is clearly a physical object that has been inserted into his body, causing him pain. However, the man is also on the phone, and the other person on the line has said something that has hurt his feelings, i.e., they have been "sharp" with him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who got stabbed is being very literal about what happened to him. He was literally stabbed in the back with a sharp object (a knife), and so he describes it as "sharply worded." The joke is clever because it also refers to the idea of being "stabbed in the back," which means to be betrayed by someone.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="3.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
