The joke is funnier if the sandbox is at a playground, because then the man would be looking for liquor in a place where children play.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man looks like he is searching for something in the sandbox, and the children watching him are scared. The joke implies that the man is looking for a bottle of Scotch whiskey that was buried in the sandbox, and that he is looking for it because he is an alcoholic. This is funny because it is a play on the fact that children often bury things in sandboxes, and adults often search for things that they have lost.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the man in the sandbox is Mrs. Freeley's husband, and that she regularly hides his bottles of alcohol in the sandbox so that he can't drink them. This is humorous because it's a role reversal: usually it's the husband who hides alcohol from the wife, not the other way around.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is acting like a dog, and the children are afraid of him. This is a play on the phrase "a man's best friend," because the man is acting like a dog and the children are afraid of him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is not actually crawling through a desert, he is crawling through a sandbox. The word "Scotch" can mean either a type of whiskey or a type of tape. In this case, it is a play on the latter meaning, as the man is presumably trying to find the tape that Mrs. Freeley has hidden in the sandbox.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man looks like he's been living in the sandbox for a while, and it's implied that he's been drinking heavily. The joke is a play on the phrase "the calvary's buried his whiskey again," which is a saying that means someone is in a bad situation because they're out of alcohol.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is crawling across the sandbox as if he is in a desert, and is therefore likely dehydrated. The joke is a play on words, as "Scotch" can refer to both a type of whisky and a type of tape. In this case, the man is saying that his wife buried his Scotch (whisky) again, but he is actually referring to the Scotch tape.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is 'crawling' across the sandbox, which sounds like he's 'crawling' across the beach. But instead of a beach, it's a sandbox. And instead of Scotch, it's sand. So the joke is that the man is trying to find his Scotch whiskey, but he's only finding sand.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the sandbox is behaving in a way that suggests he is drunk, and the fact that he is on a rooftop in a sandbox implies that he was put there by someone else as a form of punishment. The joke is clever because it uses a double meaning of the word "buried": first, that the man's Scotch (alcohol) was hidden from him by someone else, and second, the man is literally buried in the sandbox.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the sandbox is clearly drunk, and his explanation for why he's there is that his wife has hidden his bottle of scotch whisky in the sandbox. This is humorous because it's a very childish place to hide alcohol, and the man is clearly not a child.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the sandbox is looking for his "scotch," which can mean either a type of alcohol or a kind of small, coarse-grained sandstone. The wife has "buried" his scotch, meaning either she has hidden the alcohol from him, or she has hidden the sandstone. In either case, the man is not happy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is crawling across the sandbox as if he's in a desert, and he's acting like he's very thirsty. The joke is that the man is actually buried in the sandbox, with only his head exposed, and he's looking for his Scotch whiskey that his wife has hidden from him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is acting like he's in a desert, trying to find water, when he's actually just in a sandbox on a rooftop. The joke is a play on words, because "Scotch" can refer to both a type of whiskey, and a type of tape. In this case, the man is saying that his wife "buried" his Scotch (tape) in the sandbox, and he's trying to find it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's behavior is bizarre and unexpected. He's scrounging around in the sand like a dog, and the children are clearly terrified of him. The joke explanation provides a possible motivation for the man's behavior: he's looking for a bottle of Scotch that he buried, and he's willing to go to extreme lengths to find it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Scotch" can refer to both whiskey and adhesive tape. In this case, the man is Scotch tape, and the kids want to play with him because he's stuck in the sandbox; the joke is that he's been buried in the sandbox by Mrs. Freeley (perhaps because she doesn't want the kids playing with Scotch tape).</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="3.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
