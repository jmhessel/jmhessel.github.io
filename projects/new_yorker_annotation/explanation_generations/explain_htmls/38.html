He suggests letting the monster keep the dog's ball as a way to placate it, which is a humorous idea because it's such a small and insignificant thing to offer in exchange for the dog's safety.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the dog is in danger from the werewolf, the man is more concerned about the dog losing its ball than the fact that a werewolf is blocking their path and could potentially hurt them. This is silly because, while dogs are known for being loyal to their owners, they are not more important than the owner themselves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is playing fetch with the werewolf, and the man is suggesting that they let the werewolf keep the ball. This is funny because it's a reversal of the typical power dynamic between humans and werewolves: in most stories, the werewolf is the one who is terrorizing people, and the human is the one trying to avoid being eaten. However, in this instance, the werewolf is the one who is being terrorized by the dog, and the human is the one who is suggesting letting the werewolf keep the ball.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is telling the dog to "let" the werewolf "keep" the ball, but "let" can also mean to allow something to happen, as in, "letting" the werewolf keep the ball would be stupidity on the man's part. The dog, being a dog, doesn't understand the double-meaning and is just happy to get its ball back.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in this case, the man is more concerned about his dog's toy than his dog's safety. He is willing to give up the ball to the werewolf in order to keep his dog safe, which is more important to him. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the phrase "let sleeping dogs lie", which means to leave something alone that is better left undisturbed. In this case, the "sleeping dog" is the werewolf, and the man is trying to avoid disturbing it by giving it the ball.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the scene is trying to be friendly with the monster, even though the monster is clearly a threat. He does this by pretending that the monster is just a dog, and offering it his own dog's ball to play with.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's reaction to the monster is to give it his dog's ball. The logic is that, since the monster is obviously scare the dog, it might as well have the ball to play with. Additionally, this is a way to keep the monster entertained so that it doesn't bother them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a lighthearted way of diffusing a dangerous situation. The man is more concerned about his dog's ball being taken by the werewolf than he is about the fact that there is a giant, mythical creature in front of him. This is silly because, in the face of danger, people usually prioritize their safety over material possessions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man, upon coming across the monster, suggests that instead of being scared, they should give the monster the dog's ball. The ball is a toy for the dog, but to the monster, it might be a valuable treasure. The man's reaction is amusing because it's so nonchalant in the face of danger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is being polite to the monster, even though it is clearly a threat. By suggesting that the monster can keep the dog's ball, the man is showing that he values his own life more than the ball.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is being calm in the face of a werewolf, which is a mythical creature that is supposed to be feared. The fact that he is willing to give up his dog's ball to the werewolf shows how little he cares about the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is more worried about his dog's ball being taken by the werewolf than he is about the fact that there is a mythical creature in front of him that could kill him. This is silly because the ball is replaceable, but the man's life is not.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has an encounter with a werewolf, a monster that is not supposed to exist. The man tries to negotiates with the werewolf by offering to let the werewolf keep his ball, which is probably the dog's ball, in exchange for the werewolf not attacking him. The werewolf, being a monster, doesn't understand the man's language and so the man is ultimately unsuccessful in his negotiation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur: the man's only concern is getting his ball back from the werewolf, while the werewolf is only concerned with attacking the man. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the phrase "let's let him" can mean either "let's allow him" or "let's make him," depending on the context. In this case, the man is suggesting that they allow the werewolf to keep the ball, while the werewolf is suggesting that they make the man their next victim.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is more concerned about his dog's ball than he is about the fact that there is a giant werewolf in front of him. This is silly because, while the werewolf may not be able to hurt the man, it is clearly a dangerous situation, and the man should be more worried about that than the ball.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
