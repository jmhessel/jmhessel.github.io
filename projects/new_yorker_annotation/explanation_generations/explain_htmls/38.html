The man is surprised that his friend didn't have the decency to tell him to his face, which suggests that he didn't see the betrayal coming.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The person who was stabbed in the back is literally hurt, but what he is saying is that he is more hurt emotionally by the betrayal of his friend than he is by the physical pain of the stabbing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who was stabbed in the back is more concerned about the manner in which he was betrayed, rather than the fact that he was betrayed. He would have preferred a face-to-face confrontation, rather than a phone call where the person stabbed him in the back.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has just been stabbed in the back, which is a very painful experience. And yet, he's more hurt by the fact that the person who stabbed him didn't have the decency to tell him to his face. This speaks to the deep hurt that can be caused by betrayal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because most people would expect the man with the knife in his back to say something like "It really hurts," but instead he makes a comment about the betrayal. The comment is humorous because it is not what the person in that situation would normally say.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is in pain, and the fact that he was stabbed in the back suggests that he was betrayed. The fact that he's on the phone makes it even funnier, because it suggests that the person he's talking to is the one who betrayed him. The joke is clever because it plays on the literal meaning of the word "hurt" to also suggest emotional pain.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is worried about being stabbed in the back, but what really hurts is the fact that the person who stabbed him didn't have the courage to do it to his face. This is a play on words because the man is actually being stabbed in the back, but it's still a clever way to make a point about how backstabbing hurts more when it's done by someone you know and trust.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the knife in his back is making a pun on the phrase "that really hurts." The phrase "that really hurts" is often used to describe emotional pain, but in this case, the man is literally referring to the fact that he has a knife in his back. The fact that he was betrayed by someone he trusted is the emotional pain that he is referring to.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is talking on the phone with the person who betrayed him, and he is trying to act tough and like it doesn't bother him. However, the fact that he has a knife stabbed in his back makes it clear that he is in pain, and the betrayal did hurt him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has a knife stabbed in his back, which suggests that someone did not like what he had to say. The fact that he was on the phone when it happened implies that he was talking to the person who stabbed him, and that they were not able to tell him to his face. This would be a much more serious situation if it were not for the absurd image of a man with a knife in his back still talking on the phone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is seemingly more concerned about the fact that he was betrayed by someone he trusted, rather than the fact that he has a knife in his back. The joke plays on the idea that sometimes the emotional pain of betrayal can be more hurtful than a physical wound.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man was literally hurt by the knife in his back, but he is also figuratively hurt by the fact that the person he trusted stabbed him in the back. The joke is clever because it is both a physical and emotional wound that the man is lamenting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who stabbed the man in the back literally couldn't tell him to his face. This has two meanings: first, that the person who stabbed him is a coward because he couldn't do it face-to-face. Second, it's a pun on the phrase "that really hurts," which is often used to express emotional pain. In this case, the physical pain of being stabbed in the back is also being metaphorically referred to as emotional pain.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is talking on the phone to the person who stabbed him in the back, and he is more concerned about the fact that they didn't have the decency to tell him to his face, rather than the fact that he was stabbed. This joke highlights the absurdity of being more concerned about hurt feelings than actual physical pain.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has just been stabbed in the back, quite literally, but what really hurts him is the betrayal of the person who assaulted him. This has two meanings: first, that the physical pain of being stabbed is nothing compared to the emotional pain of betrayal; and second, that the person who betrayed him couldn't even have the decency to do it to his face.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="37.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="39.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
