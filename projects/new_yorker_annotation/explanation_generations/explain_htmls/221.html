The woman is probably not interested in having sex with someone who is about to blast off into space, so the man's come-on is ineffective.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pick-up line, but in the context of the scene, it's also a literal offer to go upstairs --- presumably to a bedroom, but given the man's rocket, it could also be an offer to go to outer space. The woman might be interested in either proposition, but the fact that the man has a rocket makes the offer more enticing (and also a bit more dangerous).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is saying he wants to go upstairs with the woman, but he can't because he's strapped to a rocket. The woman is probably not interested in him because he's a bit too forward, and also because he's probably not going to be able to perform well with a rocket attached to him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the ramifications of the man's rocket being too heavy to wear are not clear. It's possible that the man is going to ask the woman to help him upstairs with the rocket, or that he is going to use the rocket to fly upstairs. Either way, the situation is unusual and unexpected, which makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is asking the woman if she wants to go upstairs, supposedly to a room at the party, when really he just wants to fly away with her using the rocket. It's a play on words because "go upstairs" can mean either to go to the second floor of a building, or to have sex. The fact that he has a rocket makes it clear that he's not talking about the former.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a double entendre. The man is asking the woman if she wants to go upstairs to have sex, but he is also asking if she wants to go upstairs because his rocket is about to launch. The woman may or may not be aware of the second meaning of the man's question.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is asking the woman if she wants to go upstairs with him, but the rocket on his back makes it clear that he's not talking about going to a bedroom. The rocket implies that the man is a scientist, and he's asking the woman if she wants to go to a laboratory or some other place where he can show off his work. The woman's potential reaction to the rocket is part of what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is offering to go upstairs with the woman, presumably to have sex. However, he has a rocket strapped to his back, which makes it difficult to imagine how they would have sex. The joke is thus a play on the often used pickup line, "Want to come up for a drink" which is a euphemism for wanting to go upstairs to have sex.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is trying to pick up the woman by inviting her upstairs, presumably to his bedroom. However, the rocket is a potential danger to both of them; if it were to launch while they were upstairs, they could be injured or killed. The woman is probably wondering why the man has a rocket strapped to his back in the first place, which is another source of humor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "rocket man", which is often used to describe someone who is very passionate or sexually aroused. In this case, the man with the rocket is saying he wants to go upstairs with the woman, implying that he is interested in her sexually. However, the fact that he has a rocket strapped to him makes it clear that he is not actually interested in her, but is just using her as an excuse to test out his rocket.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is propositioning the woman to go upstairs with him, presumably to have sex. However, the fact that he has a rocket strapped to his back makes it clear that he is not interested in sex, but rather, wants to go upstairs to launch the rocket. The woman's desire for sex is juxtaposed against the man's desire to launch the rocket, making the situation humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the rocket is presumably trying to impress the woman he's talking to, and one way to do that would be to offer to take her upstairs to a more private location. However, the fact that he has a rocket strapped to his back makes it clear that he's not interested in a traditional "private conversation" but rather something more ... explosive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "go upstairs". In this case, the man with the rocket is asking the woman if she wants to go upstairs to have sex. However, because he has a rocket strapped to him, it's also possible that he's asking if she wants to go upstairs so they can fly together.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man with the rocket is asking the woman if she wants to go upstairs to have sex. However, he is also literally asking if she wants to go upstairs because the rocket is too heavy to wear for too long, and they need to go to a higher floor where there is less gravity.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="220.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="222.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
