This is a spoof on the current political situation in the United States, where the White House Chief of Staff is a position that is often in the news.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common phrase "to pursue a career in the White House." The word "dopey" can also mean "slow-witted or stupid," which is likely why that particular dwarf was chosen for the joke. The contrast between the high-powered career of White House Chief of Staff and the low-status career of a Disney character is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that Dopey, one of the seven dwarves, is Trump's former Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly.
