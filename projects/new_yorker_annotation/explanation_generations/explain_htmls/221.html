The man is saying that the lizard is biting him, but he is also saying that the lizard is his pet. This is a pun because the word "pet" can be used both as a verb (to bite) and a noun (an animal that is kept as a companion).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A typical pet lizard would not bite its owner, but this lizard is feral and is behaving more like a wild animal. The man's explanation for why the lizard is biting him is an attempt to normalize the situation, but only serves to highlight how unusual it is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "pet" can refer to a domesticated animal that is kept by humans as a companion, but it can also be used as a verb meaning to stroke or fondle someone or something in a affectionate way. In this case, the reptile is biting the person's ankle, but the person refers to it as their pet, meaning that they must stroking it in a affectionate way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lizard biting the man's ankle is acting like a typical house pet, but in this case, the lizard is a wild animal living in a cave. This joke makes light of the fact that, sometimes, people domesticate wild animals, and even keep them as pets.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is impossible for a dinosaur to be a pet of a caveman, since they are from different time periods. The punchline cofirms this, as the caveman is talking about how the dinosaur is a pet, which is clearly not the case.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "pet" can be either an animal that a person keeps in their home, or a term of endearment. In this case, the cavepeople have found a person who has been attacked by a reptile, and the reptile is biting the person's ankle. The person says that the reptile is their "pet," meaning that it's an animal that they keep in their home, but the cavepeople misunderstand and think that the person is calling the reptile a term of endearment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people in the cave are surprised to see a reptile, which are extinct animals, in someone's home. However, the person with the reptile says that it is a pet, which is a domesticated animal that is normally kept by humans. Thus, the joke is funny because it is a play on words: the word "pet" can refer to both a domesticated animal and a reptile, which are two very different things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in the context of a person being attacked by a reptile, the term "pet" is usually used to describe an animal that is usually considered harmless or not dangerous. Therefore, the joke is funny because it is a play on words; the reptile is not a pet in the traditional sense, but is instead a wild creature that is attacking the person.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "pet" is normally a domesticated animal that is kept by humans for companionship or pleasure, but in this case, the "pet" is a wild dinosaur that is biting the man's leg. The fact that the man is nonchalant about the situation also adds to the humor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the reptile is attacking the person, and yet the cavepeople still refer to it as a "pet." This is a play on words, as the word "pet" can mean both a domesticated animal that is kept by humans for companionship, and an affectionate term used to refer to someone's significant other. In this case, the reptile is neither of those things, and yet it's still referred to as a "pet," which is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man bitten by the lizard assures his friends that the animal is not a danger, but instead a "pet." This is absurd, because in the time-period that these cave-people are supposed to be living in, domesticated animals did not yet exist. The man's friends are likely not to believe him, given that they have never seen anything like this before.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in the present day, people commonly have pets that are reptiles, such as lizards or snakes. However, in the caveman era, such a thing would be unheard of, and so the joke is a play on the incongruity of a caveman having a pet reptile.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dinosaur is a pet, which would be a strange animal to have as a pet in modern times. However, in the context of cavemen, it makes more sense, since they would have probably tamed the dinosaurs. The fact that the man is being bitten by the dinosaur also adds to the humor, since it's not a typical pet behavior.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "pet" can refer to a domesticated animal that is kept as a companion, but it can also refer to a tumor or a cyst. In this situation, the lizard is biting the man's ankle, and the man refers to it as a pet, implying that it is a cyst or tumor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man biting the ankle of the caveman is a dinosaur, and not a lizard (like the other two cavemen think). In today's society, we keep lizards as pets, which is why the man biting the ankle is called a "pet." However, in the time period of the cavemen, they would have never heard of such a thing, which makes the joke funnier.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="220.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="222.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
