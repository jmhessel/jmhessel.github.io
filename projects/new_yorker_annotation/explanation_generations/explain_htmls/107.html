The person sitting in the nest is saying that he comes there to brood, which means to think deeply or to incubate eggs, but it's also a word used to describe a group of birds. So, effectively, the person is saying that he comes to the nest to sit with his friends and to think.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the person sitting on the sofa in the bird's nest is doing so intentionally, and enjoys it. This is absurd because bird's nests are uncomfortable, cramped, and smelly, and not typically considered a desirable place to spend time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The couple is sitting in a bird's nest, which is traditionally where birds go to lay their eggs and "brood" over them until they hatch. However, the couple is human, so they are technically just sitting in a nest. The joke is that they are doing the same thing that birds do in nests, but they are doing it for no reason, which is silly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "brood" can mean to think deeply about something, or it can mean a group of baby animals. In this case, the person sitting in the nest is using the word to mean both: he is sitting in a nest brooding about something, and he is also sitting in a brood of baby animals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "brood" can mean to think deeply about something or to incubate eggs. In this case, the person is using it to mean both: they are incubating eggs in the bird's nest (i.e., they are the bird), and they are also deep in thought. The irony is that it is usually not very comfortable to brood (think deeply) in a bird's nest.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the term "to brood" usually refers to birds sitting on eggs to incubate them. In this case, the two people in the nest are sitting on eggs, but they are not birds; they are people. This is a play on words, as the two people are using the nest to "brood" or to think about things, instead of to incubate eggs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Brooding" can mean both to think deeply about something, usually something that is causing negative emotions like sadness or anger, or it can mean to incubate eggs to produce offspring. In this case, the couple is using the bird's nest to do both: they are sitting on the eggs to incubate them, and they are also sitting in the nest to brood about their relationship.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person is saying that he comes to the bird's nest to brood, which means to think dark and depressing thoughts. This is ironic because bird nests are typically associated with life and growth, and not with brooding.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "brood" can mean both to think about something deeply, or to incubate eggs. The couple is sitting on a nest full of eggs, so they are technically "brooding," but they are also deep in thought. The joke is clever because it works on multiple levels.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple sitting in the bird's nest are appeared to be troubled or sad, and the woman says that she comes to the nest to brood. This is a play on words because the woman is both talking about the bird activity of sitting on eggs to incubate them, and also about feeling sorry for herself and her current situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The couple is sitting in a bird's nest, which is a common place for birds to lay their eggs (to "brood" over them). However, the couple is not birds, they are people, so they are not actually brooding. The joke is clever because it uses the word "brood" in two different ways.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is sitting in a bird's nest, which is where birds go to brood (i.e., sit on eggs to incubate them). The couple has taken on the behavior of birds, which is unusual for humans. The joke is clever because it also uses the word "brood" in its literal sense, meaning to think dark or angry thoughts, which is often what people do when they're sitting in a nest.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "brood" can mean to think deeply about something or to incubate eggs. In this situation, the person is doing both: they are sitting in a bird's nest, which is where birds incubate their eggs, and they are also deep in thought. The joke is clever because it is unexpected and uses the two meanings of the word in a creative way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the nest says he comes there to brood, which is what birds do in their nests. However, the fact that he is a human dressed in regular clothes, it's clear that he isn't actually a bird. So he is either joking, or he is using the nest for some other purpose. Either way, it's funny because it's unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The couple is sitting in a bird's nest, which is a place where birds go to lay their eggs and raise their young. However, the word "brood" can also mean to sit and think dark, depressing thoughts. So the couple is sitting in a bird's nest, brooding.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
