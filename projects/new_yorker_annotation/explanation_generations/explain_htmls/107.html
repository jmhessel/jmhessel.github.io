In this case, the man has his hands outstretched, but not in the proper position, which confuses the people on the plane. The airlines often have rules about carry-on luggage, so the joke is that the man will have to check his bag if he wants to come on board.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because when people hitchhike, they are often looking for a free ride. However, in this case, the man on the cloud is going to have to pay a fee (in the form of checking his bag) to the plane in order to get a ride.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "hitches a ride." Instead of hitchhiking on the ground, this man is hitchhiking in the sky; however, the plane he is trying to hitch a ride on has to follow the rules and regulations of the airline, one of which is that he can't bring his big bag on board.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the air traffic controller is telling the pilot that the hitchhiker needs to put his bag in the overhead compartment. However, the fact that the hitchhiker is on a cloud means that he doesn't have a bag: he's just a hitchhiker on a cloud. The joke is a play on words, with the word "bag" being both a metaphor for a person's belongings and also a real, physical object.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that, when hitchhiking, people usually try to make themselves as small and unobtrusive as possible so that they aren't judged negatively by the person picking them up. However, in this situation, the man is so large that he would need to check his bag, which would be a hassle for the person picking him up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the only way the hitchhiker could be standing on the cloud is if he were extremely light, yet he has a large suitcase with him. This means that he either packed very lightly or his suitcase is very light, both of which are amusing possibilities.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it imagines a world in which hitchhikers exist in the sky, and are subject to the same rules as hitchhikers on the ground, namely that they can't bring all their luggage with them. The joke also pokes fun at the ridiculousness of some airline rules, such as charging for extra baggage.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because airports have stringent rules about what you can and cannot bring on a plane, and often require that you check larger items. However, it's impossible to bring anything on a cloud, let alone a bag, since clouds are not solid. Therefore, the hitchhiker must be lost and the pilots are trying to tell him that he won't be able to board the plane with his bag.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man on the cloud is hitchhiking, which means he is hoping to get a ride from someone. However, the only thing that can pick him up is an airplane, and the only way to get on an airplane is by paying for a ticket. Thus, the man will have to "check that bag" (i.e., pay for a ticket) if he wants to get a ride on the plane.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is on a cloud, so he technically doesn't have any bags. However, the fact that he's a hitchhiker implies that he probably does have a bag, which he is carrying with him. The joke is that the man will have to "check" his bag, which in this context means that he will have to put it down, because he can't take it with him on the cloud.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is impossible to stand on a cloud, and yet this man is doing just that. The pilots are trying to be polite and professional by telling the man that he can come aboard, but he will have to check his bag, which is impossible because he is already standing on it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it points out the absurdity of the situation: a man hitchhiking in the sky is impossible, and yet the joke highlights the fact that even if it were possible, the man would still have to follow the rules (in this case, of the airline).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because airlines have very strict rules about what you can and cannot bring on a plane as carry-on luggage. However, the hitchhiker is carrying a bag that is very clearly not allowed: a cloud. The joke is clever because it highlights the ridiculousness of the airline's rules by pointing out that they would rather you not bring a cloud onto the plane, even though it is not physically possible.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it play on the fact that usually when people hitchhike, they try to bring as little luggage with them as possible so that it's not a burden. However, in this situation, the hitchhiker has a whole suitcase with him, which would be very difficult to carry while hitchhiking. The joke is further funny because it's impossible to hitchhike on a cloud, so the whole situation is surreal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on an airport announcement that passengers need to check their bags before boarding the plane. However, in this case, the announcement is made to the hitchhiker, who is not actually on the plane or even close to it. The joke imagines a world in which hitchhikers can try to board planes like they do cars, which is absurd.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="106.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="108.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
