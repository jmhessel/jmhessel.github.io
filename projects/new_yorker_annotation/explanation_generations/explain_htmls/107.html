If the yeti did exist, he would probably know the way around the mountain, so the hikers asking him for directions would make sense. However, since the yeti is likely not real, the joke is that the hikers are wasting their time looking for him when they should be finding their way back down the mountain.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is complaining about the man getting them lost, when in reality, if they had asked the yeti for directions, they probably would have ended up getting even more lost.

The phrase "like it would have killed you" is often used to mean that someone should have done something that would have been easy or not taken much effort. However, in this context, the phrase takes on a literal meaning, since it's likely that if the hikers had asked the yeti for directions, they would have been killed.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="106.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="108.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
