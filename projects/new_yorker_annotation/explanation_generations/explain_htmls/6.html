The question of why the gangsters are interrogating the horse instead of just killing him is irrelevant to the answer, which is that they would be accused of animal cruelty if they did. The horse's costume is also humorous because it is unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common mobster trope of using a baseball bat to "whack" someone, i.e., to kill them. In this case, the mobsters are discussing why they can't kill someone, and the reason is because of PETA, an animal rights organization. This is funny because it's a non-violent reason for why they can't kill someone, which goes against the violent nature of mobsters.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur. The gangsters are presumably being interrogated by the police officer on the horse, but the reason they give for not killing the person they were interrogating is that PETA (an animal rights organization) said they couldn't do it. This doesn't make any sense, since the gangsters aren't planning on killing the horse, and PETA doesn't have any say in how criminals are interrogated.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In the context of the mafia, "whacking" means to kill someone, usually with a weapon like a baseball bat. However, in this context, "whacking" also means to swat at, as in, to swat a fly. So, the joke is that the mafia bosses can't kill the police officer because the animal rights group PETA would object to them harming the horse.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Whack" can mean to kill someone (as in, a mob "whack job"), but it can also mean to hit someone (as in, PETA might say don't "whack" the horse). So, the joke is that the mobsters can't kill the guy because PETA would get mad if they hit the horse.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The person is saying that the police officer can't be killed, or "whacked," because of the animal rights organization PETA --- but in this context, "whack" also means to kill. So the person is saying that the police officer can't be killed because it would be against animal rights, but also because he's a police officer, it would be against the law.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Whack" can mean to kill someone, as in a mob hit, or it can mean to hit someone, as in hitting a horse. In this case, the mobsters can't whack the horse because it would be animal cruelty.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Whack" can mean to hit someone, or it can mean to kill someone. In this context, the gangsters can't kill the cop because it would be animal cruelty. However, they can hit him, which is why they are interrogating him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The act of "whacking" someone is a slang term for killing them, usually with a weapon like a baseball bat. In this case, the boss is saying that they can't kill the witness because the animal rights group PETA would be upset. The joke is funnier if the reader is familiar with both the slang term and the animal rights organization.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The mobsters are discussing why they can't kill the cop, and the reason given is that PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) said they can't. However, "whack" is also a slang term for kill, so the joke is that the real reason they can't kill the cop is because PETA said they can't kill animals, not people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "whack" is a slang term for "murder", often used in mob movies. Since the police are present, the mobsters can't just kill the guy, even though that's probably what they want to do. PETA is an animal rights organization, and so the mobsters are using the excuse that they can't kill the guy because it would be cruel to the horse.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In this context, "whack" is a synonym for "kill," but it's also slang for "beat" (i.e., to hit someone). So the gangsters can't kill the cop, but they can beat him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) is usually associated with animal rights activists, who would be opposed to the mafia's traditional activities such as violence and extortion. In this case, the mobsters are avoiding harming a police officer because they don't want to incur the wrath of PETA.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "to whack" someone means to kill them, usually with a baseball bat or a similar weapon. However, the presence of the horse dressed as a gangster (likely meaning that the police are trying to infiltrate the gang) makes it clear that the person being interrogated is the horse, not a human. Therefore, the gangsters can't kill the horse, because that would be animal cruelty.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the gangsters are interrogating someone while a cop on a horse watches. PETA is an animal rights organization, so the gangsters must be interrogating the person in an animal-friendly way, which is comically juxtaposed against their criminal activity.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
