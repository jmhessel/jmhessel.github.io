However, the fact that they are both recently single means that they might be open to the idea of a relationship, no matter where they are.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, given the bleakness of the setting, it is highly unlikely that the two people would be sitting on the same bench by coincidence. The joke implies that they are both there because they are recently single and looking for a new relationship, which is a much more likely scenario.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman said she is "sitting on some stones," which can be interpreted to mean that she is single (i.e., not in a relationship). However, the man takes this literally and says that it is a delightful coincidence because he is also recently single.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="5.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="7.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
