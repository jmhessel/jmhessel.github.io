This literal interpretation is humorous because it's not what his boss intended for him to do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in charge has asked for a meeting with the "Department Chairs," meaning the people who head up various departments in the company. However, instead of the expected executives, a line of chairs has been set up, indicating that the person interpreted the request very literally. This is silly because it's not at all what the boss meant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. When the boss says they wanted a "meeting with the Department Chairs," they are actually referring to the people who head up each department in the company. However, given the surreal context of too many chairs in the office, the word "meeting" takes on a new meaning: instead of referring to a using the chairs for their intended purpose (to sit in during a meeting), the word now refers to the chairs themselves. In other words, the boss wanted a meeting with the people in charge, but instead, they got a meeting with a bunch of chairs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's boss seems to be asking him to literally line up (or queue) the chairs in a line, when what he actually wants is for the man to schedule a meeting with the chairs of the different departments. The confusion arises because the word "line up" can be interpreted in multiple ways: to physically line up objects or to schedule an event. In this case, the boss interprets it in the literal sense, while the man interprets it in the scheduled sense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in charge (the boss) is expecting a meeting with other important people (department chairs), but instead finds a room full of chairs. This is silly because it's a huge waste of time and resources to line up that many chairs when they aren't even needed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. When a boss asks an employee to "line up a meeting," they are usually asking the employee to schedule a meeting with multiple people. In this case, the boss asked the employee to actually line up the chairs in the room. However, because there are too many chairs, it is clear that the employee misunderstood the request.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is clearly displeased with the number of chairs in the room. This is a play on words, as the word "chair" can refer to both a physical object and a position of authority. In this case, the boss was expecting the employees to line up a meeting with the people who hold the positions of "Department Chair" at their respective schools/universities. However, the employees instead lined up chairs in the office, thinking that the boss wanted a literal line of chairs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person asked for a meeting with the Department Chairs, and instead of getting a meeting with the chairs of various departments (which is what he wanted), he got a line of chairs instead. This is a play on words, as the word "line up" can mean both to arrange in a line, as well as to schedule a meeting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is asking for a meeting with his boss and the other man has lined up chairs instead of setting up a meeting with the relevant people. The chairs are in a line, which is what you would do if you were lining people up, not chairs. This suggests that the man doesn't understand what he's being asked to do, which is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Department Chair is a position at a university, not an actual chair. So when the boss asked for a meeting with the Department Chairs, he was expecting humans, not pieces of furniture. The joke is clever because it is a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in the back clearly misunderstood what their boss meant when they said to "line up" a meeting. The boss likely meant for the person to schedule a meeting with the heads of the different departments, but instead, the person scheduled a meeting and lined up chairs. This error is humorous because it's a simple misunderstanding that anyone could make.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man asked his subordinate to line up a meeting, but instead of lining up the actual people, the subordinate lined up the chairs in a line. This is humorous because it's a literal interpretation of the request, which is not what the man intended.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's boss is asking him to arrange a meeting with other department chairs, but instead of doing that, the man has just lined up chairs in a row. The boss is presumably not happy with this interpretation of his request.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in charge is angry at the person who lined up the chairs, because they think they were supposed to line up people, not chairs. This is a play on words, as the words "line up" can mean both "to arrange in a line" and "to schedule an appointment."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in charge (the boss) is expecting a certain thing (a meeting with other department chairs) but what they are getting (a literal line of chairs) is not at all what they wanted. The joke is amusing because it is a silly misunderstanding.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="5.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="7.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
