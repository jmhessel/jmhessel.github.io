The wheel has a hole in the middle, which is probably where it was meant to be placed, but the man is saying that the hole was his idea, implying that he created the wheel. This is amusing because it's unexpected and nonsensical.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is taking credit for the hole in the giant donut. The hole is an important structural element of a donut - it allows the donut to be shaped into a ring - but it's not usually something that someone would take credit for. In this context, the man is probably claiming credit for the donut's shape in order to impress the two women.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the man in the other room is considering the giant donut, the women in the living room are having a conversation. The joke implies that the man's idea for the donut was to put a hole in the middle, which is a pun on the fact that donuts have a hole in the middle.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the wheel is a sculpture, and the man is saying that he had the idea for the hole in the center of the wheel. This is a play on words because the phrase "the whole idea" means the entire concept, whereas in this context, the man is taking credit for a small part of the sculpture.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is taking credit for the design of the wheel, when the only thing he did was put a hole in the middle of it. The joke is a play on the fact that the man is claiming more credit than he deserves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the huge wheel in the room is probably a Ferris wheel, and the man is saying that he was the one who came up with the idea of the Ferris wheel. However, the joke could also be interpreted to mean that the man dug the hole in the middle of the room, which would be more in keeping with the decor of the room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is staring at the wheel and is apparently responsible for the hole in the middle. This could mean that he's the one who carved it out, or that he put it there for some unknown purpose. In either case, it's strange that there would be a huge wheel in the middle of a room, with a hole in the middle.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The "hole in the middle" could refer to the literal hole in the carved wheel, or it could refer to the man's lack of a partner. In the context of the joke, it is most likely referring to the latter, which makes the joke funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the hole in the middle of the wheel is usually there for a purpose, such as to hold an axle, but in this case, the hole is just decorative. The man is presumably the one who carved the wheel, and he's proud of his creative addition, even though it doesn't serve any purpose.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the wheel is reminiscent of a "Ferris wheel" --- a type of amusement park ride. The man is saying that the hole in the middle (which is necessary for the ride to function) was his idea, implying that he came up with the concept of the Ferris wheel. This is funny because the Ferris wheel is a very old invention, dating back to the early 1800s.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is looking at a giant donut sculpture and claims that he came up with the idea for the hole in the center. This is a play on words because the man is literally talking about the hole in the donut, but the hole is also a reference to the "wheel" (i.e., the hole in the donut is the center of the wheel).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the hole in the wheel is a metaphor for the man's lack of a life/purpose. The joke implies that the man is so unimportant/uninteresting that the only thing he can take credit for is the hole in the wheel.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the hole in the middle of the wheel is not only unnecessary, but it's also dangerous. The hole in the middle is a reference to the "dangerous" stereotypes associated with rings/circular objects (e.g., wedding rings, donuts, hula hoops). The implication is that the man had the idea to put the hole in the middle of the wheel, and it was a bad idea.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the wheel is a symbol of progress or one step forward in time, and the man claims he put the hole in the middle, which makes it go faster. This is analogous to making a hole in the middle of a wheel on a car, which would make it go faster. The joke is clever because it's a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is trying to take credit for the carved wheel, which is a common symbol of progress and civilization. However, the hole in the middle of the wheel is a necessary part of its function, without which it would be useless.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="232.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="234.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
