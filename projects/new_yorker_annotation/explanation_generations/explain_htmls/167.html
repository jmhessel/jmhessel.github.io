The man who is actually stranded on the island is the one who is thin and looks like he hasn't eaten in days. The joke is poking fun at the fact that the man who is well-fed looks like he is enjoying his time on the island, when in reality, he is just as stranded as the other man.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the student loans is on a deserted island, which is probably the last place they would expect to find him. The fact that he is holding a drink also implies that he has been there for a while, which furthers the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is well-fed and sun-tanned is assuming that the other man is a student loan collector, since he looks like he's been through a lot and is in a remote location. The man probably didn't expect to be found by his student loan collector on a small island, but the collector was able to track him down.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the briefcase is on a deserted island, and yet he is still being pursued by student loan collectors. The joke highlights the dedication (or perhaps persistence) of student loan collectors in tracking down debtors, even to the most remote locations.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the briefcase is supposedly a student loan collector, and he has found the man on the island who is hiding from his debts. The joke is clever because it is a play on the phrase "to a T," which means "exactly." In this case, the student loan collector has found the man exactly where he's been hiding.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the stereotypes associated with each character: the well-dressed man is assumed to be rich, while the man in tattered clothes is assumed to be poor. In this case, the poor man is actually a debt collector, which is a type of person who is often associated with being poor. The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that rich people are often in debt.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man on the beach is drinking from a coconut, which is a type of fruit. The other man is looking tattered and worn down, as if he's been stranded on the island for a long time. The joke is that the man on the beach is saying that the student loan people (i.e., people who give out money for college) have done a good job of tracking him down (i.e., finding him on the island).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the briefcase is presumably a student loan collector, and he has found his way to the man on the deserted island. This is a contrast to the idyllic image of being stranded on a deserted island, which is often seen as a paradise where one can escape the worries of the real world. In this case, the man on the island is still being pursued by his student loan debt.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is well-fed looks like he's about to be served a summons for his outstanding student loan debt, and the tropical island setting makes it seem even more unexpected. The joke works because it's a play on the phrase "to serve someone summons," which usually has a negative connotation because it means you're being sued. But in this case, being served summons on a tropical island would be a positive experience.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is well-fed is clearly surprised to see the man who is looking miserable and looks like he hasn't eaten in days. The well-fed man seems to think that the man who is looking miserable is a debt collector, and is surprised that they were able to find him all the way out on a small island. The joke is clever because it playfully pokes at the fact that debt collectors will sometimes go to great lengths to track down a debtor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of a man who is supposed to be on a relaxing vacation being tracked down by a student loan representative. This is a play on the fact that, often, people who are trying to avoid their responsibilities (like paying back student loans) will go to tropical places in an attempt to hide from their creditors.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is well-fed is clearly not a student loan collector, despite the fact that the other man says they are. This is because the well-fed man is on a small, remote island, and the student loan collectors would never be able to find him there.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the tattered businessman on the island is assuming that the well-dressed man is a student loan collector, and he's surprised that they were able to find him on the small island. The joke implicitly asks the question of how the tattered man ended up on the island in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the deserted island is Student Loans, and the man with the briefcase is the person who owes the loans. The joke is clever because it's a play on the phrase "debt collectors," which is usually used to describe people who track down and collect money owed. In this case, the debt collector has gone to extreme lengths to find the person who owes the money.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the briefcase is from a student loan company, and he has tracked the man down to a deserted island. This is a play on the stereotype that people who have student loans are always struggling to find ways to pay them back, and are always being pursued by student loan companies.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
