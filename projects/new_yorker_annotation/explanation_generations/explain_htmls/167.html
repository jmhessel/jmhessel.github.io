Two of his wives, Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, were infamously beheaded; Henry's last wife, Catherine Parr, outlived him. The woman in the picture has a frill around her neck that resembles a ruff, which was a type of collar worn in the Victorian era; by saying she is the only surviving wife of Henry VIII, the joke is pointing out that she is very old.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Wife" can mean both the woman that a man is married to, or simply a woman. In this case, the woman is wearing a ruff, which was a type of collar that was popular in the Victorian Era. The joke is that the woman is the only surviving wife of Henry VIII, who was famous for having many wives, only one of which survived him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on history. The woman's collar is so big that it covers half her face, which is similar to how wives of Henry the VIII were often beheaded. The joke is that this woman is the only "surviving" wife of Henry the VIII, i.e., the only one who hasn't been killed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on history. In the 1500s, King Henry VIII of England was married six times. He divorced two of his wives, beheaded two others, and one of his wives died. So, the only surviving wife of Henry VIII would be his sixth and final wife, who outlived him. However, the joke changes history slightly by saying that the woman with the large ruff around her neck is the only surviving wife, implying that she must have been very tough to survive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman's collar is so big that it covers half her face, making her look like she has a big neck. The joke is clever because it's a double meaning: the woman's neck is literally big because of the collar, but it's also a reference to the fact that King Henry VIII had many wives, and this woman is the only one surviving.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is wearing a "ruff" around her neck, which is a type of collar that was popular in the Victorian era. The joke is clever because it's a homophone --- the word "ruff" sounds like the word "rough", as in "rough housing". So the joke is that the woman is the only surviving wife of Henry the VIII because the others were killed in rough housing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman's collar is so large that it covers half her face, making her look like she has a very small head. This is a reference to the wives of Henry VIII, six of whom were executed, beheaded. The joke is that the woman's small head is a result of her being the only surviving wife of Henry VIII.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it provides a context for why the woman is wearing such a large accessory around her neck. The woman is the only surviving wife of Henry the VIII, a famously polygamous king from the Tudor dynasty who married six different women, only two of which he outlived. The joke implies that the large ruff was a gift from Henry to his favorite wife.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to how Henry the VIII of England was married six times, with two of his wives being executed, and the others dying from various causes. In this case, the woman with the large frill is the only surviving wife, hence the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. While the word "wife" normally refers to a woman's husband, in this case, it is a homophone for "whife," which is an old English word for a female demon or witch. Therefore, the joke is saying that the woman they are looking at is a witch, which is why she has a giant collar around her neck.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's extremely large collar is a reference to the ruff, which was a type of clothing worn during the Victorian Era. The joke is also funny because it's a clever play on words: "surviving wife" can mean either a wife who is still alive, or a wife who has survived Henry the VIII's notoriously bad temper (he was known for killing his wives).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is wearing a ruff, which was a type of clothing worn during the Victorian Era. However, the joke implies that the woman is actually the wife of Henry the VIII, who was a medieval king known for having many wives. The joke is clever because it's a double meaning: the woman is both literally wearing a ruff, and she is the "Surviving wife of Henry the VIII".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it provides a historical context for the woman'smassive neck ruff. It also playfully pokes fun at the fact that Henry VIII was known for killing his wives, implying that the woman is only surviving wife because she is wearing something that makes it difficult for him to get his hands around her neck.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it speaks to the Tudor monarch's reputation for killing his wives. While it's true that not all of his wives were killed ( Anne Boleyn being a famous example), the fact that this one wife is still alive speaks to how many wives he likely went through. The joke also commentary on how the woman's neck Ruff makes her look like she has a very large head, or how her head is larger than average, which could be a reference to the fact that many of Henry's wives were beheaded.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the ridiculousness of the situation: the woman's frill is so large that it is difficult to believe that it is part of her clothing, and not something else entirely. The joke suggests that the only reason the woman is still alive is because she is the wife of Henry VIII, who was known for killing his wives.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="166.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="168.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
