The podium is usually only seen in formal settings, like a courtroom or a classroom, so it's strange to see one in a casual dining setting. And, instead of talking about important issues, he's just talking about the menu items.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is giving a speech, but he is doing it in a restaurant. The joke is that he is promising soup and salad for everyone if they elect him, but it's not a very serious or substantive promise because it's something that you would normally get at a restaurant anyway. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the man is promising soup and salad, but he's really just promising the same thing that everyone else is promising, which is a meal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is making a campaign speech, but he's doing it in a restaurant. The fact that he's on a podium in the restaurant is strange, and the fact that he's promising soup and salad to all Americans is also strange (and probably not very realistic).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man at the podium is using a campaign-style rhetoric to take the woman's order. In a campaign, a politician might make promises like "if you elect me, all Americans will have healthcare." In this case, the man is promising that, if the woman elects him, she will be able to choose soup and salad from the menu. The joke is a play on the fact that, in a campaign, a politician might make promises that they can't actually keep.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is speaking as if he's giving a political speech, but the only audience is the lady who is reading the menu. He's promising that, if she votes for him, she'll be able to have a choice of soup and salad, as if that's some sort of grandiose incentive. This is silly because, of course, she can already choose soup and salad if she wants; she doesn't need to vote for him to have that choice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is giving a political speech, but he's doing it in a restaurant. The fact that he's using a podium in the restaurant is strange, and the fact that he's promising soup and salad to all Americans is also strange. The joke is clever because the man is actually running for office, and soup and salad is a common choice for starters at restaurants.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at the idea that waiters are always trying to upsell customers by giving them a spiel about the special of the day. In this case, the man at the podium is using the same tactics as a politician, making grandiose promises about what the customer will be able to get if they just elect him. The joke is clever because it highlights the similarity between the two situations: both the politician and the waiter are trying to get something from the customer (votes/money), and both are using persuasive tactics to do so.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is campaigning for something, most likely president, and he's promising that, if elected, all Americans will be able to choose soup and salad. However, the fact that he's doing this in a restaurant suggests that he's not actually talking about a political campaign, but rather a campaign for a waiter or waitress to bring soup and salad to the diners.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is giving a speech in a restaurant, which is a place where people usually go to eat, not to listen to speeches. Furthermore, the man's promise of "soup and salad" for all Americans is not a very impressive or impactful political platform. In this context, the joke is making fun of how uninteresting and unimportant the man's speech is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is giving a speech about America, and he says that if people elect him, they'll be able to choose soup and salad. This is a play on words because soup and salad is a common dish on restaurant menus, so it's not something that would normally be a part of a political speech. However, the man is saying that if people elect him, they'll have more choice, which is a relevant political issue.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is confused about what the lady is doing. He thinks she is reading through a menu to decide what to order for dinner, but she is actually reading through a menu of possible political candidates (hence the podium). The joke is a play on the fact that often times, people are not interested in politics and thus do not pay attention to who is running for office; in this case, the man is mistaking the lady's political research for something as mundane as choosing what to eat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "a choice of soup or salad", which is often offered as an option for a starter course at restaurants. In this situation, the man is making a political speech, and he's saying that, if he's elected, all Americans will be able to choose soup and salad --- as if that's some sort of grand promise or benefit of his election. The joke is clever because it's a play on words, and it's also funny because it's a very small and inconsequential thing to promise as part of an election campaign.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is giving a political speech, but he's giving it in a hotel restaurant, which is an unusual setting for such a speech. Furthermore, he's promising a very mundane policy change if he's elected: that all Americans will be able to choose soup and salad. This is a play on the fact that, often, politicians make grandiose promises that they can't or don't deliver on.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is giving a speech in a hotel room, which is strange enough, but he is also talking about soup and salad as if they are a political platform. This is Surreal because it's an unlikely thing to hear in a speech, and it's also humorous because it's a very mundane thing to be discussing in such a formal setting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man at the podium is using a campaign-style speech to deliver the woman's order. He is announcing her order as if it is a policy proposal that will improve the lives of Americans, when really it is just a simple order from a restaurant. The joke is a play on the idea that politicians often make grandiose promises that they cannot keep.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
