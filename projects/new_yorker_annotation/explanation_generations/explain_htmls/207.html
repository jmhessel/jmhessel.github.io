The word "restraint" can mean both self-control and the physical act of restraining someone.

The word "restraint" can mean self-control, or it can refer to the physical restraint of being in a straightjacket. In this case, the joke is punning on the fact that the woman behind the desk is restraining herself from attacking the other woman, even though she is physically restrained by a straightjacket.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman behind the desk is admiring the other woman's "restraint" in wearing a straightjacket, when in reality, the straightjacket is constraining her movement. This joke highlights the absurdity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two women, who are presumably interviewing for a job, are wearing straightjackets. The comment about restraint is a pun, because the women are restrained (by the straightjackets) and also because the interviewee is showing admirable restraint by not responding to the interviewer's comment in a more emotional way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people in the straitjackets are not actually restraining themselves, which is what the phrase "I admire your restraint" usually means. In this context, the phrase takes on a new and absurd meaning, since the people in straitjackets are not restraining themselves at all.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the first woman is saying how much she admires the second woman's restraint in not going crazy, despite the fact that they are both wearing straightjackets. The joke is funny because it is a play on words: the second woman is restraining herself from going crazy, but the straightjacket is also restraining her physically.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people in the scene are wearing straitjackets, which are made to restrain people. The comment about admiration is sarcastic, because the restrained person is not actually free to move. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the restrained person is wearing a "strait" jacket, which is a type of clothing, and the commenter is admiring their "restraint," which in this context means their ability to control themselves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two women are wearing straightjackets, which are meant to restrain people. However, the fact that they are in an office and talking relatively calmly implies that they have restrained themselves very well, considering the circumstances.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman behind the desk is wearing a straightjacket, which is used to restrain people. The joke is that she is admiring the other woman's "restraint" in not going crazy, despite the fact that they are both clearly in a madhouse.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two women are in straightjackets, which are designed to restraining people, and yet they are managing to have a conversation. The joke is also clever because "restraint" can refer to both the physical act of restraining someone, as well as to self-control more generally.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person is wearing a straitjacket, which is a garment made to restrain someone, usually because they are considered to be a danger to themselves or others. The fact that the person is restrained in a straitjacket implies that they are not very restrained in general, yet the other person complimenting them on their "restraint" is ironic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "restraint" has two meanings: one is physical restraint, as in being tied up in a straitjacket, and the other is emotional restraint, as in not losing one's temper. In this case, the person is admiring the other person's ability to stay calm in the face of provocation, but the fact that they are literally restrained in a straitjacket makes the situation humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman behind the desk is interview the other woman, who is wearing a straitjacket. The fact that the interviewee is restrained makes the interviewer's comment of "I admire your restraint" ironic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people in the scene are wearing straitjackets, which are garments designed to restrict movement. Thus, the joke-teller is being sarcastic when they say they admire the other person's restraint because the person is literally restrained.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people are in straitjackets, which is the opposite of restraint. The joke is making a play on words, where the word "restraint" can mean both self-control and the straitjacket itself.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="206.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="208.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
