In this case, the stick figure's wife didn't get the happy face in their divorce, meaning she didn't get what she wanted, which was presumably the stick figure himself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the man is talking to a stick figure, he makes a joke about how the stick figure's wife must have been very unhappy in their marriage. The joke is funny because it's a play on words --- the stick figure's wife didn't get the "Happy Face" brand of lube, which is a type of lube that is often used during sex.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The happy face is a famous smiley face emoji. The character being interviewed is a stick figure, which is a child's drawing of a human that is often drawn with a happy face. In this case, the happy face represents the emoji, not the stick figure's facial expression. The joke is that the stick figure went through a tough divorce, but in the end, the other party didn't get the happy face emoji that they wanted.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the stick figure is talking about his former wife getting the "Happy Face" emoji in the divorce settlement. The joke is clever because it is a play on the phrase "the short end of the stick," meaning that someone got the worse deal in a situation. The joke is also clever because the stick figure's wife literally got the happy face emoji, which is a small, simple image.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "Happy Face" in this case is both a literal happy face, as in the emoticon, and a term often used in business to describe a satisfied customer. The joke is clever because it uses the two meanings of "Happy Face" to pun on the phrase "rough divorce", which is usually used to describe a divorce that was difficult and contentious.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Rough divorce" can mean either that the divorce was difficult/emotional or that it was physical (i.e., the couple fought a lot). In this case, it's both: the couple was so physical with each other during their divorce that the husband didn't get the "Happy Face" stick figure that is commonly drawn by children.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. In the context of the stick figure being interview for a job, the happy face is a part of the stick figure's resume: the happy face represents a happy/positive attitude, which is a desirable trait in an employee. However, in the context of a divorce, the happy face would be the property of the ex-wife: the joke is that, even though the husband got divorced, he still has the happy face, which is more valuable to him than anything else he could have gotten in the divorce.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "rough" can mean both difficult/hard AND harsh/abrasive. In this case, the man is saying that his divorce was both difficult and that his ex-wife is harsh/abrasive. The Happy Face is a smiley emoji, which is often used to depict happiness. The fact that the interviewee is a stick figure makes the joke even funnier, because the emoji is literally the only facial expression that the stick figure can make.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the stick figure's divorce was successful; he didn't have to give up the Happy Face, which is a yellow smiley face that is often used to symbolize good moods or happiness. The face is also a symbol of the popular emoji. In this case, even though the stick figure went through a tough divorce, he still has the Happy Face, which is a small victory.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the stick figure is drawn without a facial expression, which is known as a "happy face". The fact that the stick figure is going through a "rough divorce" is a play on words, since the phrase is usually used to describe a divorce that is contentious and full of fighting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is interviewing a stick figure, who is not a happy face, for a job. The divorce analogy is used because, in a divorce, each party usually tries to get the best possible outcome, but in this case, the man didn't get the happy face.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the happy face emoji and the sombre subject of divorce. The happy face is used to represent positive emotions, so it is unexpected in the context of a divorce, which is typically a negative experience. The joke is also funny because the happy face emoji is a ubiquitous part of modern culture, and it is unusual to see it in a job interview context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a play on words on the happy face emoji, which is often used in texts and emails. In this case, the happy face is a real, human-like stick figure, which is unusual. The joke is also a play on the phrase "couldn't be happier," which often is used to describe people who have just gone through a tough divorce.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the stick figure is a very simplistic drawing, often used to represent a happy or positive emotion. However, the fact that the stick figure is applying for a job implies that the person is going through a tough time, which is represented by the divorce. The joke is clever because it uses the contrast between the happy face and the divorced stick figure to create a punchline.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a job interview, it's common for the interviewer to ask about the applicant's experience, skills, and qualifications. However, in this case, the interviewee is a stick figure, which doesn't have any facial features, let alone a "happy face." Therefore, the interviewer's comment about the applicant's divorce is unexpected and humorous.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="46.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="48.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
