Now I'm kinda hungry.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though there are traps everywhere and the food is locked up, the person is still more interested in getting something to eat than avoiding the traps. This is a play on the fact that, even when people are in dangerous or difficult situations, they still often have basic needs like food and water.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people in the kitchen are surrounded by traps and spikes, which would make it very difficult to cook or eat anything. The person's casual statement that they are now hungry is in contrast to the peril they are in, and makes the situation seem even more hopeless.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person is so focused on the traps that they are now hungry. This is a play on the fact that people often set traps in kitchens because that is where food is typically found.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person is indicating that they are hungry, but because everything in the kitchen is either locked up or dangerous, they can't actually get anything to eat, which is the ironic twist.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who has just walked into the kitchen has realized that they are going to be hungry, but also that it will be very difficult (and dangerous) to get anything to eat, since everything is locked up and there are traps everywhere.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur. The speaker is talking about how he's hungry, but the context is a dangerous kitchen filled with traps. This contrast creates a comedic effect.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the kitchen is so heavily booby-trapped that the person who set it up clearly doesn't want anyone getting in there. However, the person who made the joke is now hungry, so they clearly want to get in there. This is a conflict of interest, and thus, the joke is funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is casually remarking on their hunger, despite the fact that they are surrounded by deadly traps. In a normal situation, the speaker would be focused on the traps and avoiding them, but in this case, their hunger takes precedence, which is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is saying that they are now hungry, implying that they were not hungry before, despite seeing the various food items that are locked up and unavailable. This could be because they are not allowed to have any of the food, because it is trapped, or because they are not allowed to enter the kitchen at all.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a normal scenario, the couple would be able to go to the fridge and get food to eat, but because the fridge is booby-trapped, they can't do that. The joke pokes fun at the fact that, even in a dangerous/unusual situation, people still have normal needs like eating, and the contrast between the mundanity of that need and the improbability of the situation is what makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person is hungry, but they can't get to the food because the kitchen is so dangerous. It's a play on words because the person is both physically and figuratively "trapped."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who said it is standing in a kitchen full of deadly traps, which would presumably make it difficult to prepare a meal. The joke highlights the contrast between the dangerous environment and the mundane activity of cooking.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is saying that they are now hungry because they can't get to the food. This is a play on words because the speaker is both saying that they are physically hungry because they can't get to the food, and also that they are "hungry" for food, in the sense that they would like to eat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the kitchen is so heavily trapped that the person who set the traps up can't even get to the food to eat it. This is silly because the logical thing to do would be to set the traps up after getting the food, so that you can eat it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people seem to have forgotten that there is food in the kitchen, and are now regretting their decision to lock it all up. This is silly because they could just unlock the food and eat it, but they seem to have forgotten that it exists.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="46.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="48.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
