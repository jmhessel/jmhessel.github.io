This is ironic because it is usually the husband who is interested in other women, not the other way around.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the husband is stranded in the water, and the wife is considering invite the shark who is defensively guarding her to stay for dinner. The joke is clever because it's a play on the idea of "what's for dinner." In this case, the husband is potentially on the menu.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common trope of a woman being interested in a man who is not her husband. In this case, the woman wants to invite the shark to dinner, presumably so that he can eat her husband. The shark's protectiveness of the woman adds a further level of irony to the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is nervous that her husband is in danger of being eaten by the shark, but is nonchalantly suggesting that they invite him to dinner as if it's no big deal. This emphasizes the husband's expendability to her, and also pokes fun at the idea that someone could be eaten by a shark.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the man's infidelity: the woman is suggesting that, since her husband is clearly interested in the shark (i.e., he's swimming towards it), they invite the shark to dinner so that the three of them can eat together. This dinner would be a way to, figuratively, "consume" the man's infidelity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is suggesting that, since the shark is seemingly protecting her from her husband, that they invite the shark to dinner. This is humorous because it would be strange to have dinner with a wild animal, let alone a shark. Furthermore, the woman's nonchalant attitude about her husband potentially getting eaten by the shark suggests she is more interested in the shark than her husband.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is suggesting that they invite the man, who is currently swimming away from the island, to stay for dinner, even though he is trying to get away and the shark is clearly interested in him. The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that sharks are often considered to be dangerous and deadly predators.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common trope of a woman being afraid of her husband/boyfriend's jealousy. In this situation, the woman is actually justified in being afraid: if her husband found out that she was alone on an island with another man, he would be very jealous. However, the other man is a giant shark, so the woman suggests that they invite him to dinner. This is funny because it's a complete role-reversal: instead of the woman being afraid of the man's jealousy, the man should be afraid of the shark's jealousy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is suggesting that they eat the man, who is presumably her husband. This is a macabre joke, as it's playing off the stereotype that sharks are dangerous and often eat people. The fact that the shark is only interested in the man, and is seemingly protectively guarding the woman, adds an extra layer of irony to the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is being facetious when she suggests that they invite the man, who is presumably her husband, to stay for dinner. In reality, she is nervous about the shark's interest in the man, and is trying to find a way to get rid of him. However, the way she phrases her suggestion makes it sound like she actually wants to have the man for dinner, as in, she wants to eat him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is suggesting that they invite the shark who is trying to eat her husband for dinner. She is either very nonchalant about the whole situation, or she is trying to be polite to her would-be murderer. Either way, it's a funny response to a dangerous and life-threatening situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is suggesting that, despite the man being in danger from the shark, they should invite him to stay for dinner. The joke works on two levels: first, the obvious level, that the man is about to be eaten by a shark, so it's absurd to invite him to dinner. Second, the joke implies that the woman is interested in the man, and wants to have him over for dinner so she can spend more time with him, even though he is her husband's rival.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, although the woman is on the island with the shark and the man is in the water, it's clear that the shark is protective of the woman and not the man. This is a reversal of the common gender roles, where the man is supposed to be the protector. The joke here is that, because the shark is protecting the woman, the man should be the one who is afraid, not the woman.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the man is not currently on the island (and, in fact, is in danger from the shark), the woman suggests that they invite him to dinner. This is seemingly oblivious to the fact that, if they invite him to dinner, he will have to come back to the island, where the shark is waiting to eat him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that usually when a woman invites a man to "stay for dinner," it's a euphemism for having an affair. In this case, the woman is actually asking the shark to eat her husband for dinner. The fact that the shark is seemingly guarding her from her husband also plays into this, as if the shark knows what she's thinking.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="101.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="103.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
