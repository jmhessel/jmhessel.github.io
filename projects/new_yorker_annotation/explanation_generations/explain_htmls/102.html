The caveman is talking about how he would kill for some "cream cheese," when in reality, he's just eating a stone wheel. The word "cream cheese" is a homophone for "crime cheese," which makes the joke funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "I'd kill for a doughnut." The cavemen are surrounded by doughnuts, but they can't eat them because they're made of stone. The one caveman who is eating the doughnut is probably going to get sick because stone is not edible. The other caveman is joking that he would kill for some cream cheese, which is a common topping for doughnuts, but since they're in the stone age, there is no cream cheese.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "I'd kill for a doughnut." The caveman who is eating the doughnut is enjoying it so much that he wishes he had cream cheese to go with it, implying that he would be willing to kill for it. This is a humorous exaggeration because, of course, cream cheese is not worth killing for.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="101.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="103.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
