A fire down by the old Jetson's house?</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The aliens are asking what a "boy" is, and the answer is that it's a young human male. However, the aliens mishear the word as "boy," which is a type of fire. This is a pun because "boy" can also refer to a young human male (i.e., a boy).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "boy" can mean a young male human, or it can refer to a type of fire. The aliens in the UFO are looking at a dog, which they clearly don't understand, and they mistake it for a "boy," or a young human. But, because they don't understand human culture, they think that "boy" means a fire. This is a play on the common misunderstanding that aliens would have about human culture.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the aliens are encountering a dog for the first time and they are trying to make sense of it by comparing it to something they are familiar with: a boy. They are baffled by the dog's suburban appearance and behavior, and so the joke is a play on the fact that they don't understand what a dog is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The aliens are trying to figure out what the dog is, and they ask if it is a "boy." The dog is indeed a boy, but the aliens mishear and think they are asking if it is a "fire." The aliens then ask if the fire is at the old Jetson's house, which is a reference to the cartoon The Jetsons, which is set in the future. This is funny because it is a play on words and also because it is a reference to a popular cartoon.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it blends the suburban image of a dog with the extraterrestrial image of the bald humans. The joke also playfully pokes at the fact that, to the aliens, the suburban image of a dog might be as exotic as the extraterrestrial image of humans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The Aliens are asking the dog what species he is, and the dog, not understanding their language, mistakes their question for another unrelated question. In this case, the aliens are asking about the dog's species, but the dog hears them asking about a boy, who is a human.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the aliens are trying to figure out what a "boy" is, and they mistakenly think it is a fire. This is a play on words, because "boy" can also refer to a young human male, and the aliens don't realize that.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because when one hears the word "boy", they might think of a young human male child. However, in this context, the word "boy" is used to refer to the dog, which is not a boy, or even a human. Similarly, the word "house" is used to refer to the spaceship, which is not a house. These words are being used in non-standard ways, which is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The aliens are asking what a "boy" is, and the dog is a "boy". But the aliens misheard the question, and thought they were being asked what a "boy" was doing on the fire. The aliens believe the dog is a creature from Earth's past, which is why they are asking what it is doing on their spaceship.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "What is it?" can be read two ways: as a question about the nature of the thing ("It" being the dog), or as a inquiry into the thing's name. The second reading is funnier because "boy" can be both a gender-neutral term for a young person, and a term used to address a male dog. The aliens, who are unfamiliar with Earth customs, interpret the term "boy" literally, and thus think that the dog is a young male human.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it confuses the aliens: in their world, there is no such thing as a "boy," or a "dog," or even a "Jetson's house." And so, when they see this creature that they don't know how to classify, they can only make a guess based on the limited information they have. In this case, they guessed that the dog might be a "boy," which is a human child, or something that is on fire.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "What is" sounds like "where is", and "boy" sounds like "Baja", which is a location in Southern California. The aliens might be trying to find the dog's home planet by asking him where he's from, but the dog is too dumb to understand them. The dog might be from the planet Earth, as evidenced by the suburban background, but the aliens don't realize it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the aliens are wondering what a "boy" is, and the dog is trying to explain that it's a human child. However, instead of saying that a boy is a human child, the dog says that a boy is a "fire down by the old Jetson's house", which is a reference to the cartoon The Jetsons. This is funny because it's a non-sequitur: the aliens are trying to understand what a boy is, and the dog just starts talking about a completely unrelated topic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The aliens are trying to figure out what the word "boy" means, and they've heard that it's a small human. However, they misinterpret the word "boy" to be a type of fire, specifically one that would be down by the old Jetson's house. This is a reference to the TV show "The Jetsons", which takes place in the future and features a family with a dog.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is trying to ask the dog what "boy" is in dogspeak, but instead of saying "boy" they accidentally say "bone" which is another word for "boy" in dogspeak. This confusion is funny because it's a play on words.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="139.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="141.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
