Wave</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Row" can refer to the act of paddling a boat, but it can also refer to a fight or argument. In this case, the joke is suggesting that the people in the boat are literally fighting against the waves, which is funny because it's usually the other way around --- people in boats try to avoid waves, not fight them. Furthermore, the joke is made funnier by the inclusion of the Statue of Liberty in the background, which is a symbol of American immigration. The joke suggests that even the waves are trying to stop people from entering the country.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the Supreme Court case, Roe v. Wade. In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruled that abortion was legal in the United States. The joke here is that, instead of abortion, the case is about rowing (an activity often done in boats). The punchline is that, just like in the Roe v. Wade case, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the activity (in this case rowing), meaning that the people in the boat are legally allowed to keep rowing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common legal phrase "case of X v. Y." In this instance, the joke is suggesting that the people in the boat are going to have to go to court against the waves in order to prove that they have a right to be there. This is humorous because it's absurd: obviously the waves cannot go to court, and it's a ridiculous idea that the people would have to defend themselves against something as natural as a wave.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the famous Supreme Court case, "Roe v. Wade", which legalized abortion in the US. In this case, "Row v. Wave", the legal question would be whether or not it's legal to kill a wave ( presumably in self-defense). The Statue of Liberty in the background is also ironic, given that she is a symbol of freedom and opportunity in the US, but the waves are literally trying to kill the people in the boat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a pun on the name of the famous Supreme Court case, Roe v. Wade. The Roe in this case is not the legal case, but rather one of the people in the boat who is trying to row away from the giant, scary wave. The joke is clever because it's a play on words; in the Supreme Court case, Roe was the name of the plaintiff, while in this joke, Roe is the name of the rower.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "row" can mean to propel a boat through the water using oars, or it can be a fight or argument. The fact that the wave has a face with an angry expression implies that it is in a fight with the people in the boat, and the people are rowing away from the wave to escape.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Row" can refer to the act of rowing a boat, but it can also be short for "rowdy" or "disorderly." The wave is literally rowdy and disorderly, causing the people in the boat to have to row hard to get away from it. This play on words would be funnier if the wave was actually chasing the boat, but it's still amusing nonetheless.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully references the famous Supreme Court case of "Roe vs. Wade." In the original case, a woman (Roe) was fighting for the right to have an abortion. In this joke, the "wave" is trying to kill the people in the boat, but the people are rowdy and fighting back, much like how Roe fought for her rights. The joke is clever because it takes a real world event and twists it to be about something completely different.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the legal case "Roe v. Wade." In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruled that a woman's right to have an abortion was protected by the Constitution. In this case, "Row v. Wave," the joke is that the rowing people are trying to escape the waves, and the waves are trying to reach them. The joke is a play on the idea that waves are dangerous and can kill people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the phrase "row v. Wade," which is a legal case in the United States regarding abortion. In this case, "row v. wave," the word "row" is a homophone for the word "roe," meaning that the joke is about a legal case involving a women's right to choose whether or not to have an abortion. The joke is clever because it uses a homophone to make a play on words, and it is also relevant to current events.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the legal term "row v. wave." In this case, "row" refers to the people in the rowing boat, while "wave" refers to the gigantic wave with a face looming above them. The joke is clever because it suggests that the rowing boat is trying to fight the wave in a court of law, which is impossible.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people in the rowboat are rowing away from the large wave that has a face on it, as if they are trying to outrun it. However, the people will never be able to outrun the wave, which is a natural phenomenon; the wave is personified in this joke, making it even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it takes the phrase "to row against the tide/current" and literally applies it to a situation where people are rowing against a wave. In other words, the immigrants in the boat are struggling against the obstacles in their way (the huge waves), but are determined to continue moving forward ("rowing"). The Statue of Liberty in the background is a symbol of hope for many immigrants, which makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the famous court case, "Brown v. Board of Education". In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that segregation in schools was unconstitutional; in this case, the joke is that the Supreme Court would rule that the waves trying to push the boat back are also unconstitutional. The joke is clever because it's a play on words ( Row vs. Wave) as well as a play on an important Supreme Court case.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the Supreme Court case "Roe v. Wade." In the Roe v. Wade case, the court was faced with the question of whether or not a woman's right to privacy included the right to have an abortion. In this joke, the court is faced with the question of whether or not a person has the right to row their boat, even if it means that they will be disrupted by a large wave.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
