They may have gluten!</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because gluten is a protein found in wheat and other grains that some people are allergic to. Thus, the idea that aliens might have gluten is funny because it's a seemingly innocuous thing that could be dangerous to humans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because gluten is a protein found in wheat, and wheat is a common allergen for humans. However, since the aliens are not human, they are not likely to be allergic to gluten. The joke is also funny because it highlights the absurdity of the situation: the people hiding behind the bush are more scared of the aliens' weapons, which they think may be made of gluten, than the actual aliens themselves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because theToaster is a common household appliance, and typically, aliens come from outer space. In this instance, the aliens are coming from the toaster, which is a surprising and absurd reversal of the norm. Furthermore, the idea that aliens would be afraid of gluten is humorous, because gluten is a common protein found in wheat and other grains, and is not generally considered to be dangerous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it takes the classic trope of aliens being "gluten-free" and subverts it. In this case, the aliens aren't gluten-free, they are made of gluten, which is a shock to the humans hiding behind the bush. The joke is also a play on the fact that many people believe that aliens are coming to Earth to eat humans, so the humans' fear of the aliens is compounded by the fear that they will be eaten.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of aliens possessing gluten, which is a protein found in wheat. Gluten is often demonized as an unhealthy food, so the idea that aliens would be scared of it is humorous. Additionally, the aliens coming out of the toaster is a play on the "pop-up" toaster, which is a toaster that pops bread up when it is done toasting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually when people are afraid of something coming out of a toaster, it's because they are afraid of being burned by the toast. However, in this case, the people are afraid of the aliens, and especially, the aliens may have gluten, which is a harmless protein found in many grains. The contrast between the dangerous thing people usually worry about coming out of a toaster (being burned) and the relatively harmless thing they are worried about in this case (aliens with gluten) is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because gluten is a protein found in wheat and other grains that some people are allergic to. The implication is that the aliens may be dangerous because they may be carrying something that could harm the people on Earth. However, the joke is also funny because gluten is not something that is typically associated with aliens or extraterrestrial life.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because gluten is a protein found in wheat that many humans are allergic to. However, aliens are not human, so it is unlikely that they would be affected by gluten in the same way that humans are. The joke is also funny because the kids are more scared of the aliens because they might have gluten, which is harmlessly, rather than because they are aliens, which are more traditionally seen as beings that might want to hurt humans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because gluten is a protein found in wheat and other grains that some people are allergic to. It is strange that the kids would be worried about the aliens having gluten because it's not something that is harmful to humans. However, the fact that the aliens are coming out of a toaster, which is typically used to make bread products, suggests that they may be made of wheat and other grains, which would make them dangerous for people with gluten allergies.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because gluten is a protein found in wheat that some people are allergic to. The aliens in the spaceship are probably aliens from another planet, and the people on earth are worried that they might be allergic to whatever the aliens are made of. However, the use of the word "gluten" is a pun, because it is also a common ingredient in bread, which is often made in the shape of a toaster. Thus, the joke is also funny because it's a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Gluten is a protein found in wheat, which is a common allergen for humans. However, the fact that the people in the park are worried that the aliens may have gluten implies that they think the aliens are going to attack them with wheat, which is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because gluten is a protein found in wheat, and people with Celiac disease or gluten-sensitivity cannot eat gluten. The aliens' appearance from the toaster is similar to how toast pops out of a toaster, and the implication is that the aliens are made of gluten. Thus, the joke is that the people hiding behind the bush are worried that the aliens might be harmful because they contain gluten, which some people cannot eat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the concern that the aliens may have an allergen that could harm the children. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the common fear that extraterrestrial life may be harmful to humans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the fear of gluten, which is a protein found in wheat that some people are allergic to. However, in this case, the speaker is more concerned about the aliens being dangerous, rather than the toaster bread being inedible.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because gluten is a protein found in wheat and other grains that some people are allergic to. The joke is playing on the fact that aliens are often imagined as being allergic to things that are common on earth, like water or oxygen. In this case, the aliens are allergic to gluten, which is found in many common foods.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="47.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="49.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
