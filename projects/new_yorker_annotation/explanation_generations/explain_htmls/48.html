They might have outstayed their welcome because they overstayed their actual welcome, or they might have destroyed the kitchen so badly that the Traps were meant to protect the new kitchen from them. In any case, it's clear that they are not supposed to be there.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The couple is wondering if they "outstayed their welcome" by staying too long at their hosts' house. But, given all of the traps around the kitchen, it's also possible that their hosts are trying to trap them or hurt them in some way. So, the couple is wondering if they are in danger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually people go to great lengths to make their guests feel welcome, including going out of their way to have food and drink available. In this situation, however, it seems that the owners of the home have gone too far in the opposite direction: they have locked away all the food and made the kitchen so dangerous that it seems they would rather their guests not be there at all.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person is suggesting that the reason they are now being subjected to deadly traps is because they have outstayed their welcome in the other person's home. The joke is made more funny by the contrast of the deadly traps with the relatively benign setting of a kitchen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people are trapped in a room full of deadly traps, and the implication is that they set off the traps by staying in the room for too long. This is a play on the idiom "to overstay one's welcome," which means to stay somewhere for too long and become a nuisance. In this case, the two people literally overstayed their welcome and are now in danger because of it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The couple is asking if they've overstayed their welcome in the home of whoever set all the traps, because usually, people only trap things that they want to get rid of, like animals or pests. But the other meaning of "outstaying one's welcome" is to overstay the amount of time one is supposed to stay somewhere, like at a hotel or a friend's house. So, the joke is also asking if they've overstayed their welcome in the literal sense, and if that's why the traps were set.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is clearly not welcome in the kitchen anymore, given that everything is booby-trapped. They may have overstayed their welcome with whoever set the traps, or they may have just arrived to find the traps. In either case, it's clear that they are not supposed to be there.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple has set so many traps in their kitchen that it seems likely they are trying to trap someone or something. This could be interpreted as meaning that they are trying to trap a visitor in their home, or that they are trying to trap themselves inside because they are on a diet and don't want to be tempted by the food outside. Either way, the joke is clever and makes you think about the possible meaning behind the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is wondering if their hosts (or perhaps their own home after a long vacation) has become so dangerous that they need to leave because they are no longer safe. The traps imply that something hostile is after them, and they need to escape. However, the traps could also be there to protect the food in the fridge from them, implying that their hosts are worried about them getting fat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The people in the kitchen have "outstayed their welcome," meaning they've stayed too long and are no longer welcome, but they've also "outstayed their waist," meaning they've eaten so much they can no longer fit through the traps and spikes in the kitchen. The joke is a clever way to combine the two meanings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is absurd: it's not common for people to have to resort to such extreme measures to keep people out of their kitchen. The couple is clearly not happy about the situation, and the joke is a play on the phrase "outstaying one's welcome," which means to overstay one's welcome, or to stay at a place for too long.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is usually the ones who are guests in someone else's house, and it's generally impolite to overstay one's welcome. In this case, the couple seems to be the ones who own the house, and they have set out so many traps that it seems like they are trying to ward off guests.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the implication is that the person who set up the traps did so because they felt that the two people in the kitchen were overstaying their welcome. This is a humorous way to describe what would otherwise be a deadly serious situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The two people in the kitchen have clearly been trapped there against their will, and they are asking if maybe they've stayed too long and their hosts are trying to kill them. However, the other meaning of "outstaying one's welcome" is overstaying one's welcome in somebody else's home, which is the more likely scenario here. The joke is funny because it's a play on the two different meanings of the phrase.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Outstayed our welcome" can mean either that the couple has overstayed their welcome at the house they are staying in, or that they've been killed by the traps and their bodies are now decomposing, which would also explain the bad odor.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="47.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="49.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
