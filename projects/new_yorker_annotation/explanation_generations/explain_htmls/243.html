In a normal shipwreck scenario, people would be instructed to "abandon ship" in order to save themselves from drowning. However, in this situation, the people are so small that the only way to save themselves is to abandon the cup (of tea) that they are in.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "abandon ship!" which is what someone would normally say in the event of a shipwreck. In this situation, the men are in a teacup, which is about to be abandoned, so the speaker is telling the other man to abandon the cup.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the maritime command "Abandon ship!" which is given when a vessel is about to sink and the crew must evacuate.

In the context of the situation, where the two men are sailing in a cup of liquid, the idiom becomes "abandon cup." This is humorous because it is a non-standard use of the idiom, and because of the incongruity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the famous phrase "Abandon ship!" which is shouted when a ship is sinking and people need to evacuate. In this situation, the ship is inside a cup of tea, so the people are technically already abandoned, and thus the phrase is a non-sequitur.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "abandon ship" is a call that is typically made when a ship is sinking and people need to evacuate. However, in this situation, the ship is sinking inside a cup of tea, so the phrase becomes "abandon cup."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "abandon" can mean to leave something behind or to give up on something. In this context, the people are being asked to leave the cup (of tea) behind because it is sinking and they will drown if they stay inside it. However, the fact that they are "abandoning" the cup also means that they are giving up on it, which is a fitting response considering the fact that it is a cup of tea and not a ship that is sinking.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the maritime phrase "abandon ship." In a life-threatening situation at sea, the phrase is used to tell people to abandon the ship and escape in lifeboats.

In a shipwreck, the captain will sometimes give the order to "abandon ship," which means that everyone should evacuate the ship. However, in this situation, there is no ship to abandon; the ship is inside the cup of tea. The cup is too small to contain the ship, so the people are drowning. The joke is a play on words, and it's also a pun because the people are inside a cup of tea.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the nautical command to "Abandon ship!" In this case, instead of a ship, it's a cup, and instead of the ocean, it's a coffee mug.
