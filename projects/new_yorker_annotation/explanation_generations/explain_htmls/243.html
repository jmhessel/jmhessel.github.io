The bull is in a china shop, so the fact that he's on commission means that he's getting paid for every piece of china he breaks. The joke is that, because he's now getting paid to break things, his attitude has changed and he's become more well-mannered.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull is acting well-mannered, which is unusual for a bull. The joke suggests that the reason the bull is acting this way is because he's on commission, implying that he's being paid for his good behavior. This is a play on words, as the phrase "on commission" can also mean that someone is being paid based on their performance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "commission" can refer to a fee paid for services, but it can also mean "to entrust or charge with a task or responsibility." In this case, the store owner has charged the bull with the responsibility of protecting the china, and the bull is doing a good job of it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull is being well-behaved in the china shop, and the implication is that the bull's good behavior is due to the fact that he's on commission. This is a play on words, because the word "commission" can refer both to a percentage of sales that a salesperson earns, and to a group that is assigned to oversee a particular task. In this case, the commission is the group of people who are responsible for the bull's behavior.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is talking about the bull as if it is a salesperson in the store. The bull being on commission means that it is being paid based on how much it sells, which changes its attitude because it now has a financial incentive to do well. This is a clever way of saying that the bull is behaving better because it is being paid, which is not something one usually thinks of in relation to bulls.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "commission" the speaker is referring to is the bull's being put on commission at the china shop, which has caused the bull to have a better attitude. However, the word "commission" can also mean a group of people who are tasked with a specific goal, which in this case, is the group of customers browsing the china shop. Thus, the speaker is saying that the bull is doing a better job than the humans in the room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of "commission": in a normal scenario, commission is a percentage of sales that is given to an employee as an incentive to boost sales. However, in this context, the bull is on commission, meaning that he is being paid to break things. The fact that the bull is being paid to do what he naturally does ( break things) is absurd, and thus, funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "changed his attitude" can mean two things: 1) the bull's disposition has changed and he is now more relaxed, or 2) the bull has changed his opinion, as in, he now likes the porcelain cups. However, in this case, the woman is saying that the bull's attitude has changed in a third way: he is now motivated to break the porcelain because he is being paid commission (i.e., he gets a cut of what he breaks).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common idiom "a bull in a china shop." The idiom means that someone who is clumsy or destructive is like a bull in a china shop, i.e., they will break things. However, in this scenario, the bull is actually being well-behaved, which goes against the meaning of the idiom.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "commission" can mean two things: 1) a fee that is given to someone for doing a job and 2) a group of people that have been charged with a task. In this case, the bull was changed by being put on commission (the first meaning), but the joke is that the bull is now part of a commission (the second meaning), i.e., a group of animals that have been charged with the task of observing things in a china shop.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull is acting like a normal customer in the store, looking at cups and probably considering buying one. However, the fact that he's a bull makes it strange, and thus the joke. The punchline is that the bull was likely put on commission, which means he's being paid for his sales, and that's why he has a good attitude—he's being compensated for his work.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull is acting so well mannered, and even the customer acknowledges that it's out of character for the animal. The bull is acting this way because it's on commission, meaning that it gets a percentage of the sales it generates, which is why it's being so careful not to break anything.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the shop owner has managed to calm the bull by giving it a commission, which goes against the stereotype that bulls are violent animals. The joke suggests that the bull is now more interested in the products in the store and is behaving like a salesperson.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the juxtaposition of the OP's expectations (that the bull would be destructive) with the reality (that the bull is well-mannered). The punchline reinforces this contrast by suggesting that the bull's good behavior is due to the fact that he is on commission, which implies that he is being paid to be well-mannered.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The person who said "you were right" is talking about the bull, who is now working on commission, and thus has a better attitude. However, the word "commission" can also mean a group of people who are assigned to do a task, and in this case, the bull is part of a group of people (the customers) who are browsing at the china shop.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="242.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="244.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
