However, the police lineup includes several other mythical or religious figures who are not constrained by such prohibitions, including God, Satan, and Buddha. The fact that the police officer is still trying to respect the prohibition against depicting Muhammad adds an absurd element to the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is being asked to identify a religious figure who is the true culprit, but the police have to obscure his face because of the religious sensitivities around depicting sacred figures. This is a play on the fact that different religions have different restrictions on how their deities can be depicted, with some prohibiting any depictions at all.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police lineup is composed of religious figures who are not subject to human laws. Furthermore, the fact that the woman is being asked to identify the true culprit implies that there is some sort of crime that has been committed, which is also humorous because it's not clear what these religious figures could have possibly done wrong.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the fact that many religions have a concept of "god" or "gods" that are considered to be sacred and thus cannot be depicted in human form. In this case, the gods are in a police lineup, and the officer is telling the woman that she cannot see the face of the sixth god in the lineup, presumably because it would be considered sacrilegious.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police lineup includes a supernatural being who is not allowed to be shown. This is because he is beyond the comprehension of humans and thus cannot be pictured.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the religious figures in the lineup are not real people, and thus the police can't show the face of the "suspect" (No. 6). This joke pokes fun at the fact that many religions have a prohibition against showing the face or image of their god or gods.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the legal rule that witness identity cannot be tainted by seeing a police lineup that includes the actual suspect. In this case, the police lineup includes religious figures who are not subject to human laws, so the woman being asked to identify the culprit can't possibly choose the right one. The police officer's warning is amusing because it's a recognition of the absurdity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idea that some religions don't allow their followers to see depictions of their religious figures. In this case, the religion is "mythology," and the followers are people who don't believe in those myths. The police lineup is a comedy of errors because the religious figures don't exist, so the woman can't identify the true culprit.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lineup includes religious figures who are not subject to human laws, yet the police are still adhering to a rule that prohibits them from showing the face of the sixth person in the lineup. This is presumably because the sixth person is God, who is often depicted as being unrepresentable or mysterious.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because religious figures are often depicted with their faces hidden or in shadow, to emphasize their mystery or divinity. In this joke, the face of the sixth religious figure is hidden because he/she is the true culprit, and the police are not allowed to reveal the identity of the culprit. The fact that all the religious figures are in a police lineup suggests that they are all being accused of a crime, which is humorous because they are not subject to human laws.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully mocks the idea that religious figures, who are not actual people, could be put into a police lineup. If they were put into a lineup, the police would have to obscure the face of the figure, because they don't actually exist. The joke goes even further by implying that even the number 6 is too sacred to reveal, in a humorous exaggeration of the idea that some religious icons are too holy to show.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the police lineup is of mythical and religious figures who cannot be captured on film or photo due to their nature, the woman is still being asked to identify the one she saw, even though they all look alike and she can't see their faces. It's a play on the fact that these figures are notoriously hard to depict, and even though the police have them in a lineup, they still can't show her their faces.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police station is showing a lineup of religious figures, one of which is the devil. The devil is traditionally depicted with a red face, horns, and a pitchfork. However, since the police station can't show the face or image of the devil, they have to rely on the woman to identify him by his red face and horns. This is difficult because, as the joke implies, there are many religious figures who have these features.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, of course, the face or image of the religious figure known as "God" would not be able to be shown in a police lineup, since no one knows what God looks like. In addition, the fact that the other religious figures in the lineup are shown without issue further highlights the absurdity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police officer is telling the woman that they can't show her the face of the suspect in the lineup because he is a supernatural being. The fact that the police have to accommodate for this and can't show her his face is humorous.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
