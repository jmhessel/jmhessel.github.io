I'll only end up hurting you.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is talking to the man as if he's a bee who is about to sting her. However, the man is not a bee, he's a human being who is stuck inside the beehive. The woman is telling him to leave because, if he stays, he'll only end up getting hurt --- presumably, because the bees will sting him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's reaction to the man's head in the beehive is to walk away. The joke is implying that the man's head in the beehive is a metaphor for something else that would scare her away, like a hidden secret or deformity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's head is stuck in the beehive and he is telling the woman to leave him. In this situation, the man is in a bee hive and is asking the woman to leave him because he doesn't want to hurt her. The joke is clever because it is a play on the phrase "I'll only end up hurting you" which is often used when breaking up with someone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is presumably in a relationship with the man whose head is in the beehive, and she is telling him to leave her. The fact that he has a head in a beehive is a metaphor for how he is not thinking clearly and is controlled by the bees.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's comment is a non sequitur. It doesn't make sense in the context of the scene because the woman wasn't trying to hurt him. The man's comment is only funny because of the absurd image of a man stuck in a beehive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "I'll only end up hurting you," which is often said by people who are breaking up with their partners. In this case, the man's head is in a beehive, which is a dangerous place, and he is telling the woman to leave him because he doesn't want her to get hurt.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the fact that bees will often sting people if they get too close to their hive. In this case, the man's head is in the hive, and he is telling the woman to leave before she gets hurt. The double-meaning is that he is also saying that he will only end up hurting her if she stays, meaning that he is attracted to her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is telling the man to leave her alone, but the man's face is literally attached to the beehive. He can't leave her alone, because he's physically attached to the tree. The woman is telling him that it's better for him to leave because she doesn't want to hurt him, but she knows that she can't help but hurt him because he's literally attached to her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is telling the man to "just go" as if he was leaving her, but the fact that he's stuck in a beehive prevents him from going anywhere. The woman is warning the man that if he stays, he'll only get hurt, because bees will sting him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that bees often sting humans when they're threatened. In this case, the bee hive is the man's head, and the woman is being threatened by the fact that if she stays, the man will eventually sting her with his bee hive head.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "End up hurting you" could mean that the speaker will accidentally sting the other person with their bee stinger, or it could mean that the speaker will break up with the other person and hurt their feelings. In either case, the speaker is saying that it's best for the other person to "just go".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is telling the man inside the beehive to leave, and the word "hurt" can mean either physical pain or emotional pain. In this case, the woman is saying that if the man stays, he will only end up getting hurt emotionally.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "I'll only end up hurting you." In this case, the woman is saying it to the man with a human face on a beehive, meaning that she'll only end up getting stung by bees if she stays near him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is telling the man to leave her alone, but the man is hiding in a beehive, so she can't actually see him. The fact that she can't see him and is still telling him to leave suggests that she can feel his presence, even though he's hidden. This joke is funny because it plays with the idea of a man hiding being creepy, even if the woman can't see him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the man inside the beehive is telling the woman to "go" away, but "go" can also mean to have sex. Therefore, the man is telling the woman that if she stays, they will end up having sex (and he will "hurt" her, in the sense that he will leave her after having sex).</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="10.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="12.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
