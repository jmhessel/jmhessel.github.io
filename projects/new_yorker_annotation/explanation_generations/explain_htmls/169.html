The joke is a play on words, because the coffee filters are not actually around the woman's neck, but the joke is still clever.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the coffee filters are an unlikely item to be used in the construction of a lady's ruff. The coffee filters would normally be used for, well, coffee, so the joke is funny because it's a play on words: the coffee filters are being "used" in a way that is not their intended purpose.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the huge ruff around the woman's neck makes her look like she has a giant coffee filter on her head. This is unexpected and humorous because coffee filters are not usually associated with the Victorian Era.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because coffee filters are usually small and nondescript, so it's unexpected that such a large object would be made out of them. The fact that the two men are staring at the woman so intently implies that they are trying to figure out what the object is, and the coffee filter explanation is a humorous way of explaining its origins.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the classic cartoon "The Two mice", in which two mice are trying to figure out what happened to all of the coffee filters. The mouse in the cartoon is wearing a collar similar to the one the woman is wearing, and when he sees the woman, he thinks that she is responsible for the disappearance of the coffee filters.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because coffee filters were not commonly used during the Victorian Era; instead, coffee was often filtered through ruffs, which were large, collar-like garments worn around the neck. The woman's ruff is so large that it looks like a coffee filter, and the men's surprise at seeing it implies that they did not expect to find such a modern item in the Victorian Era.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the word "ruff" which can mean either a type of collar or a disturbance. In this case, the collar is so big that it is causing a disturbance. The fact that the men are staring at the woman suggests that they find her collar to be very strange or unusual.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the huge collar around the woman's neck is similar in shape to a coffee filter. The joke is also a play on words, because "to filter" can mean to remove impurities from a substance, or to pass something through a device to remove impurities. In this case, the coffee filters have been removed (i.e., filtered out) in order to make the woman's collar.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the large, fluffy collar around the woman's neck makes her look like she has a huge coffee filter stuck to her head. This is silly because coffee filters are not usually that big, and they are not usually worn as clothing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because coffee filters were not widely used during the Victorian Era; they were not invented until 1908. Therefore, the huge collar the woman is wearing is more likely a ruff, a type of collar that was fashionable during that time period. The joke suggests that the man is surprised to see such a large and impractical collar being worn, and he comments on how it must be the source of all the coffee filters in existence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the huge collar on the woman's neck makes her look like she has a coffee filter around her head. This is a play on the fact that coffee filters were invented in the Victorian Era, so the man is joking that the woman's collar is made from one of the new coffee filters.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men are looking at the woman's very large ruff and one of them comments that it explains where all of the coffee filters have been going. Coffee filters are usually small and the woman's ruff is very large, so it's unlikely that all of the coffee filters would fit inside it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because coffee filters are usually small and round, while the woman's frill is large and round. The coffee filters must have been used to create the frill, which is an unusual use for them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the huge ruff around the woman's neck makes her look like she has a giant coffee filter around her neck. This is a play on the stereotype of English people drinking a lot of tea.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "that's where all the tea went", which is a common phrase used in England. In this joke, instead of tea, the commenters are astonished to see that the woman's huge collar is made out of coffee filters. This is a clever way to make a joke about the Victorian era, because during that time England was known for its tea drinking culture.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="168.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="170.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
