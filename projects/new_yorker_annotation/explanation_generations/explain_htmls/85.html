I gotta keep moving.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the shark is in a hurry to finish the interrogation and leave, implying that it has other places to be and other things to do. This is silly because, as a shark, its only natural habitat is in the water, so it's very odd for it to be in a hurry to "keep moving."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the shark's response to the interrogation. The cop's question implies that the shark is under suspicion for a crime, but the shark's response shows that it's not concerned with the interrogation at all and just wants to leave. The contrast between the seriousness of the interrogation and the casualness of the shark's response is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The shark is saying that he needs to keep moving because he will die if he stops moving, but the police officers are trying to interrogate him, which requires him to stay still.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the shark is in an interrogation room, which is a place where people are typically not moving. The fact that the shark is there, and is telling the cops that he needs to keep moving, is absurd because it is not possible for the shark to survive outside of water for very long.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because sharks have to keep moving to breathe, and if they stop moving, they will die. The shark is saying that he needs to keep moving to stay alive, and the detectives, who are trying to question him, are impeding his progress.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the shark is in danger of dying if it is out of water for too long. So, the detectives need to hurry up and finish the interrogation so that the shark can get back into water.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The cop is asking the shark questions about a case (e.g., "What did you see?"), but the shark is also telling the cop that he needs to keep moving because he will die if he stops swimming.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the shark is saying that he needs to hurry because he needs to keep moving. This is a reference to the fact that sharks need to keep swimming or they will die. The joke is funny because it is a play on words: the shark is saying that he needs to hurry so that he can keep "moving," as in swimming, but the policemen are trying to get him to stay "still," as in not moving.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of how Sharks are known to constantly swim in water and sharks in the interrogation room is just not something you see every day. The cop is saying that he wants to get this over with quickly because he still has a lot of work to do, in contrast to the shark who is just trying to stay alive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The shark is saying that it needs to keep moving because it needs to stay in water to live, but the detectives are trying to interrogate it about a crime. So, the shark is essentially saying that it wants to leave because it's going to die if it stays any longer.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the shark is trying to hurry through the interrogation so that he can get back into water. He is emphasizing the need to keep moving, which is something that sharks are known for. This is difficult for the detectives, because they need to get information from him, but if they take too long, the shark will die.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the shark is in a police interrogation room, which is a very stationary place. The fact that the shark is there despite being an animal that needs to be constantly moving is absurd, and thus the joke is funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the shark is acting like it's a normal criminal being interrogated by the police. However, the fact that the shark is a shark makes the joke funnier, because it's not a normal criminal --- it's a wild animal that shouldn't be in the interrogation room in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "I gotta keep swimming" which is often used to describe the determination to keep going in the face of adversity. In this case, the adversity is the interrogation, and the shark is just trying to get it over with so it can go back into the water.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the shark is saying that he needs to keep moving, which is something that sharks need to do to survive. But, in this case, the shark is in an interrogation room, which is not a place where one can keep moving. The fact that the shark is aware of this and still wants to keep moving highlights the absurdity of the situation.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="84.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="86.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
