This is a play on the fact that subway trains are typically found in urban areas, not forests. The joke is clever because it uses the subway trains' normal behavior (staying in stations) as a contrast to their current behavior (wandering around a forest) to create a humorous incongruity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the fact that, in general, animals will run away if they see you coming, but the subway trains are so out of place that the animals are curious about them instead. The rangers have to approach them quietly so as not to startle them and make them leave.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it acknowledges the weirdness of the situation --- two men, in the middle of the forest, coming across two subway cars. But, instead of making a comment about the situation, the joke comments on the reaction of the men, as if the situation is completely normal. The joke is funnier because, in a way, it is true: if you want to see animals in the wild, you have to be quiet so as not to scare them away.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on how animals in the wild often have a keen sense of smell and hearing, and so they can detect predators from far away. In this case, the explorers are the predators, and the subway cars are the animals; the joke is that the cars will "depart" (i.e., leave) if they know the explorers are nearby.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that wild animals will often flee if they see or hear humans coming. In this case, the wild animals are subway trains, which are usually found in cities, not forests. The joke implies that the subway trains are so city-dwelling and domesticated that they will run away from humans even if they are just five steps away.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's absurd to think that subway cars would be in the middle of the forest, and even more absurd to think that they would be alive. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the idea that if you see an animal in the wild, you should approach it quietly so as not to scare it away. In this case, the animal is a subway car, which can't be scared away because it's inanimate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the "if you love something, let it go" idiom. In this case, the speakers are talking about subway cars, which are inanimate objects, as if they are wild animals. The joke is also funny because it's absurd to think that subway cars would just randomly be in the middle of a forest.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the subway cars are out of place, and the explorers are acting like they are wild animals that will be scared off if they make too much noise. This is humorous because it is the complete opposite of how people usually act around subway cars: people are usually trying to make as much noise as possible to get the attention of the driver so that the subway car will stop and let them on.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "if you know what's good for you". The explorers are trying to be quiet so as not to disturb the subway cars, but of course subway cars can't hear or be disturbed. The joke is also a play on the fact that subway cars often seem like they are alive, with their own quirks and personalities.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common trope of animals fleeing when they see humans. In this case, the animals are subway cars, which are inanimate objects. The joke also implies that the explorers are tracking the subway cars like they would wild animals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's absurd to think that subway cars could be living creatures that would be afraid of the hikers. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the common advice to hikers to approach wild animals quietly so as not to scare them away. In this case, the advice is absurd because the creatures the hikers are approaching are not wild animals, but inanimate objects.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Approach quietly" can mean to move closer to the trains cautiously, but it can also mean to make less noise. "Depart" can mean to leave, but it can also mean to die. So, the joke is saying that if the subway trains know the rangers are five steps away, they will "leave," or die.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "depart" can mean both to leave and to die. So the joke is that if the subway trains know the rangers are five steps away, they will leave (to avoid being caught) or they will die (because the rangers will shoot them).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rangers are trying to sneak up on the subway trains, as if they were wild animals. This is silly because, not only are subway trains not animals, but they are man-made objects that would not be afraid of the rangers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The expected thing would be that if the explorers are silent, they might startle the wild animals and cause them to flee. However, in this case, the animals are two subway cars. The joke is that instead of animals reacting to the explorers, the explorers are reacting to the subway cars.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
