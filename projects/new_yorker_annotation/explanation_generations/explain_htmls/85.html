"Turning someone off" can mean either that you are no longer interested in them romantically, or that you are repulsed by them. In this case, the man's head literally turning into a blender is so bizarre that it would turn anyone off, in both senses of the phrase.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the blender on the man's head is a metaphor for how his brain is working overtime trying to process information and come up with conversation topics. The woman's confused look implies that she's not really sure what to make of the situation, or the man. The man's head spinning is also a visual representation of how he's feeling overwhelmed, possibly because he's nervous on a date.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's reaction to the man's blender head is one of confusion and disgust. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the woman is asking what physical trait of the man would turn her off, and the answer is literally his blender head.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="84.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="86.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
