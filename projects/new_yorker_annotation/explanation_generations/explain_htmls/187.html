This is a play on the fact that, even though they are breaking the law, they are still following the rule of not riding through a red light.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people on the tandem bike are both on their phones and not paying attention to their surroundings. One of them says that the other person ran a red light, but because they were both on their phones, they technically both ran the light.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of the two people on the phone, the man is telling the other person on the phone that he technically ran a red light, which is a minor infraction. However, because they are on a tandem bicycle, the man on the phone is technically correct: the front rider, the one with his hands free, is the one who would have had to stop at the red light, but because the rear rider doesn't have brakes, the whole bicycle ran the light.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple on the bike are riding so far apart from each other that they can't see each other's actions. The man is telling the woman that she technically ran a red light, even though he can't see if that's true or not.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the two people on the tandem bicycle technically ran the red light, it's not as serious of an infraction as if they were in a car because they are on a bicycle. The fact that they are on the phone and not paying attention is also a contributing factor to why running the red light is less serious.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the cyclists are on a very long bike, they are both on their own cell phones and not paying attention to each other or their surroundings. The man says that the woman technically ran a red light, even though they are both on the bike, because she wasn't paying attention. Technically, he is correct, but it's a moot point because they are both on the bike.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people on the bike are technically breaking the law by riding on the phone, but the person who is beingrot must point out that the other person ran the red light, which is a more serious offense. The joke is a play on the idea that two wrongs don't make a right.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people on the bike are technically breaking the law by running the red light while on their phone. The joke is clever because it's a play on words --- the two people are "red light runners," but they are also in a "tandem," meaning that they are side-by-side.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while running a red light is a traffic violation, it is not as serious as, say, riding a bike while on the phone. However, because the bike is so long, it takes up more than one lane, and thus, technically, the bike ran the red light, even though the riders did not.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a two-person bike, both people pedaling the bike are considered to be running the bike, so if one person on the bike runs a red light, then both people on the bike technically ran the red light. The joke is a play on words, using the fact that "running" can mean both "operating" and "moving quickly on foot."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the two people on the tandem bicycle being on the phone while they ride. One of the cyclists is telling the other that they technically ran a red light, even though they were both on the bike together. This is a play on the fact that often, when two people are doing something together, one person will try to take sole credit or blame for the actions, even though they were both involved.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the idea of the "blind leading the blind". The two people on the tandem bike are not paying attention to their surroundings and are instead focused on their phones. One person points out that the other person ran a red light, but since they are both not paying attention, it's not clear if either of them actually saw the light.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while riding a tandem bicycle, both people have to be in sync in order for it to work properly. However, in this case, the two people are not in sync because one of them ran a red light, which led to the other person getting a ticket. This joke highlights the importance of communication and coordination when riding a tandem bicycle.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people on the bike are technically breaking the law by using their phones while riding a bike. However, the person who is pedaling the bike could argue that the other person, who is steering, is the one who actually ran the red light, since they would have been the one paying attention to the traffic signals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people on the tandem bicycle are arguing over who is at fault for running a red light, even though they are both clearly in the wrong. The joke is a play on the fact that tandem bicycles require coordination and communication between the two riders in order to avoid accidents.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="186.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="188.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
