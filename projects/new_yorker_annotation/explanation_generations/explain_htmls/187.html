<p style="text-align:center;"><img src=https://jmh-public.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/capcon/all_newyorker/all_new_yorker_images_v2/new_yorker_nextml_images/587.jpeg></img></p><p style="text-align:center;font-size:30px">I was young and needed the money.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are looking at a deer crossing sign, which is meant for drivers to know when to yield to deer on the road. However, the deer in the picture are upright and looking at the sign, as if they are confused about it. The joke is that the deer are so confused by the sign that they think it's telling them to cross the road, and they are trying to figure out why.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the old saying "I was young and dumb/stupid." In this case, the deer are young and need the money, implying that they are not very bright. This is funny because deer are not known for being particularly intelligent animals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because crossing signs are meant for deer, but deer don't actually walk upright like humans do. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the deer are looking at the crossing signs, but they aren't actually crossing, because they don't walk on two legs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it gives a reason for why the deer are doing something that is impossible for deer to do: walk on two legs and look at art in a museum. The joke is also funny because it paints the deer in a very human light, making them seem like they are just desperate for money and willing to do anything for a quick buck.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in North America, deer crossing signs are ubiquitous, and it's unusual to see deer looking at them with any sort of admiration. The joke suggests that the deer in the picture may have been the model for the deer crossing signs, implying that he was once a working deer before he retired to the museum.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the implausibility of the scene: not only are the deer able to walk on two legs, but they are also able to appreciate art by looking at the deer traffic signs. This is absurd because deer are not able to walk on two legs and they are not intelligent enough to appreciate art. The joke is made funnier by the fact that the deer seem to be dressed in human clothes, which adds to the absurdity of the scene.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The deer are looking at deer crossing signs, which are meant to warn drivers to be careful of deer crossing the road. The joke is that the deer are confused by the signs because they don't understand why drivers would be careful of deer crossing the road when deer themselves don't even know how to cross the road.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer in the picture are clearly enjoying looking at the road signs, and the joke implies that they are reminiscing about the time when they posed for the signs. The joke is clever because it is a play on words --- "I was young and needed the money" can mean either that the deer needed money when they were younger (e.g., to buy food), or that they needed money when they were young (e.g., to pay for their education).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because deer are not known for being intelligent creatures, and so the idea that they would be working as models for road signs depicting deer crossings is absurd. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the phrase "I was young and needed the money," which is often used to explain why someone did something they now regret. In this case, the deer regret posing for the signs because they are now the target of drivers who want to hit them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The deer are admiring road signs that have pictures of deer crossings on them, which is something that they would do in real life. However, the fact that they are road signs implies that they are being paid to do this, which is why the deer says that he was young and needed the money.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are looking at the crossing signs with confusion, as if they don't understand what they're for. The deer in the joke is making a light-hearted comment about how they used to have to walk upright when they were younger (i.e. before they grew antlers) and needed the money.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are looking at the deer crossing signs, and they appear to be confused by them. The joke is that the deer are confused because they are trying to figure out why the signs say "deer crossing," when deer don't actually walk upright like humans do. The joke is a play on words, because when humans are confused about something, they might say that they "need more information." In contrast, the deer "need" the crossing signs because without them, they would be hit by cars.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because deer are not known for being able to read, let alone understanding road signs. The joke implies that the deer is standing upright and reading the road sign, which is impossible. The deer is probably just confused about the road sign, but the joke is making fun of the deer's intelligence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer in the art gallery are looking at road signs that were made by other deer. The deer in the gallery are looking at the road signs with a sense of wonder, as if they are looking at their own reflection. The joke is a play on the saying "I was young and dumb/naive", which is often used to explain away poor decision making. In this case, the deer are looking at the road signs and marveling at how they were able to make them, even though they are just simple road signs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The deer in the picture are road signs, and the deer in the museum are actual deer. The deer in the museum are looking at the road signs and commenting on how the deer in the signs must have been young and needed the money. This joke is a pun on the phrase "young and dumb".</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="186.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="188.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
