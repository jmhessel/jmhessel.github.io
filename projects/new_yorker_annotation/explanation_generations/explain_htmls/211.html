The lifeguard is telling the skater to be careful because the water is hard, meaning that it is frozen and thus more difficult to skate on. However, the skater could also interpret the lifeguard's words to mean that the water is literally hard, as in, not soft.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the skater is on ice, which is frozen water, and so the water is naturally hard. The lifeguard is telling the skater to be careful because the water is hard, but the skater is already being careful because he's on ice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is warning the skater about the water being hard, when in reality, the surface they are skating on is ice, which is hard.
