In this case, the commandment has been changed to "thou shalt not machine wash," which is a more modern context. The joke is humorous because it's a play on how the Bible is often interpreted very literally, even though the commandment in this case is clearly not meant to be interpreted that way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common phrase "thou shalt not," which is typically used to introduce a commandment. In this case, the commandment is about not washing something in a machine, which is a surprisingly specific and mundane commandment. This joke is clever because it's a play on words and it's unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The first part is a reference to the famous story of Moses receiving the Ten Commandments from God on Mount Sinai. The second part is a play on the commandment "Thou shalt not kill," which is usually interpreted as meaning that one shouldn't murder. In this case, the joke is re-interpreting the commandment to mean that one shouldn't machine wash sweaters, which would ruin them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the Bible verse "Thou shalt not kill." In the context of the picture, with Moses receiving the Ten Commandments from God, the joke is that instead of one of the commandments being about not killing, it is about not machine washing sweaters, which is a silly thing to have as a commandment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully mocks one of the most serious and well-known of the Ten Commandments ("Thou shalt not kill"), by substituting in a mundane and everyday task, machine washing, in its place. The joke also pokes fun at the idea of God, who is often seen as all-powerful and omniscient, giving such a specific and seemingly unimportant instruction.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idea that the ten commandments are rules that must be followed. In this case, the commandment is about not washing your clothes in a machine, which is a bizarre thing to be told not to do. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the idea that Moses received the ten commandments from God on Mount Sinai.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The Commandment is "Thou shalt not kill", but in this context, it is re-interpreted as "Thou shalt not machine wash", which is a commandment that goes against the modern practice of machine washing clothes. This joke is funny because it is a clever way to point out the absurdity of some of the Commandments.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. In the Bible, the Ten Commandments are a set of rules that God gave to Moses. In this joke, God is giving Moses a sweater with the instruction not to machine wash it. This is a clever way of saying that the Ten Commandments are a set of rules that should not be broken.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that the ten commandments are a set of guidelines that are meant to be followed. In contrast, the commandment that Moses is given in this joke is much more specific and mundane. The joke is poking fun at the idea that the commandments are meant to be general rules that everyone should follow, but in reality, they are often quite specific.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully subverts one of the Ten Commandments: "Thou shalt not kill." In this context, the commandment is about not washing your clothes in a washing machine, which would damage the fabric. But, by re-labeling it as a commandment from God, it suggests that there is a higher power that is against doing laundry in a machine.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The commandment is usually phrased as "Thou shalt not kill," but in this context, it is phrased as "Thou shalt not machine wash." The joke is clever because it not only changes the meaning of the commandment, but it also makes a pun on the word "kill."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The original Ten Commandments say "Thou Shalt Not Kill." Machine washing is a process that can kill clothes, so this commandment would be saying that people should not machine wash their clothes.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the Ten Commandments given to Moses by God on Mount Sinai. In this version, the commandment is not to machine wash sweaters, which would be a sin. This joke is clever because it speaks to a modern day problem in a humorous way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that the commandment says "Thou shalt not kill." Killing is a bad thing, so it's natural to assume that machine washing is also bad. However, the idea that God would give a commandment about clothing care is absurd and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that the ten commandments are a set of rules that are supposed to be followed strictly. In contrast, the commandment that is given in the joke is a guideline that is more flexible. This joke pokes fun at the idea that the ten commandments are a rigid set of rules that cannot be broken.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="210.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="212.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
