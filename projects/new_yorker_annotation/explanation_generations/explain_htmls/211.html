The maid has the gun at the ready, as if she's about to shoot, but the man she's talking to seems more interested in talking than in being shot. The man may be assuming that the maid is going to rob him, given the circumstances.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The maid is talking to the man who is clearly in the middle of a shootout, and she's scolding him for not wanting to talk to her during the week when she came by to clean his room. But, now that he's in the middle of a life-or-death situation, he suddenly wants to talk to her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The maid is holding a gun to the door, which has a "Do Not Disturb" sign on it, and the man is saying that he only wants to talk to her now that she is holding a gun. The maid is presumably going to rob the man's room, which is why she has the gun, and the man is insinuating that he would have been more receptive to her advances earlier in the week if he had known she was carrying a weapon.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the maid is seemingly fed up with the guest who, during the week, had their "Do Not Disturb" sign up the whole time. The maid is now holding a gun on the guest, probably because she was sick of being ignored all week.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The maid is saying that she only wants to talk to the man now that he has a "Do Not Disturb" sign on his door, which means he doesn't want to be disturbed. This is ironic because the maid is the one who is disturbance, by being in the hallway with a gun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that often times maids or other service workers are not given the proper respect by the customers they serve. In this case, the maid has had enough, and is brandishing a gun. The man, who is either her current or previous customer, is now trying to talk to her, but she is not interested.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is trying to talk to the maid, who is staking out the place with her gun and cleaning cart. The maid is doing her job, but the man is trying to talk to her and interrupt her. The maid is probably trying to get away from the man, who is acting like a typical entitled hotel guest.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is only interested in talking to the maid now that she has a gun, when all week he wanted her to leave him alone. This is a play on the common phrase "Do Not Disturb," which is usually found on hotel room doors to indicate that the occupants do not want to be disturbed. In this case, the man was using the phrase to try to discourage the maid from coming into his room, but the maid is now using it as a threat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the maid is CLEANING the rooms, and thus would want people to keep the "Do Not Disturb" sign on the door, so she knows not to enter. But, in this case, the man has just come back to his room and is talking to the maid, who now has a gun out. The maid is using the "Do Not Disturb" sign as a metaphor for how the man ignored her all week, and now he wants to talk.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the maid is threatening the people in the hotel room with a gun, after they presumably ignored her and did not answer the door when she was trying to clean the room. The maid is thus getting revenge by pointing a gun at them. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words; "disturb" can mean both to disrupt or to clean.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common "Do Not Disturb" sign that is put on hotel room doors. The maid, with a gun drawn, is telling the man that he wanted to be left alone all week, but now that she has a gun, he wants to talk. The maid is using the gun to make the man talk, which is an unusual way to get a guest to engage.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the disparity between the man's current situation --- being held at gunpoint by a maid --- and his earlier one --- being alone in his hotel room. In both cases, the man wants privacy, but in the first case he wants it to be uninterrupted, and in the second case he wants to be interrupted so that he can talk to the maid. Thus, the maid's gun pointing at him is the ultimate form of interruption.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the maid is armed and dangerous, and yet the man is trying to talk to her and be friendly. He is clearly referencing the "Do Not Disturb" sign that is often hung on hotel room doors, indicating that the occupants don't want to be disturbed. The maid, however, is ignoring this sign (and the man's wishes) and is instead brandishing a gun and preparing for a shootout.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the maid is carrying a gun, which is an implicit threat, and the man is making a joke about how the maid was being distant when he wanted attention. The maid being armed makes the man's comment about wanting attention more humorous, because it's a contrast to the maid's earlier behavior.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="210.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="212.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
