The doctor is trying to find a silver lining in the situation and notes that the arrows are well-made, but the cowboy is not Native American. This is a double meaning because "native" can also mean "original" or "from birth," so the doctor could be saying that the arrows are original and from birth, meaning that they were handmade and not mass-produced.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is trying to find a silver lining in a very dire situation. The cowboy is obviously in a lot of pain, and is likely going to die, but the doctor points out that at least the arrows are well-made.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "On the plus side" can mean that there is a silver lining, or a good aspect to a situation, despite some bad parts. In this case, the "plus side" of the cowboy being impaled with arrows is that it's a good example of the crafting skills of Native Americans. The joke is clever because it's not immediately obvious how that could be interpreted as a good thing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cowboy has been shot by arrows, which are usually associated with Native Americans. The doctor's comment that the arrows are well-made is a play on the stereotype that Native Americans are good at crafts.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "On the plus side" is often used to mean "in a positive light" or "in a good way". However, in this case, the "plus side" refers to the fact that the cowboy has been shot with arrows. The joke is also funny because it is a stereotype that Native Americans are good at making arrows.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The doctor is saying that the arrows are very well made, and the cowboy is clearly in a lot of pain. The joke is clever because it is true: the arrows are very well made, but the cowboy is clearly suffering.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the man is clearly in a lot of pain and is close to death, the doctor is making a light-hearted observation about the arrows. The joke relies on the contrast between the seriousness of the situation and the casualness of the doctor's comment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The doctor says that the arrows are a "terrific example of Native American craftsmanship" but the word "terrific" can also mean "causing terror or great fear." In other words, the doctor is saying that the arrows are very well made, but they are also very frightening.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cowboy is clearly in a lot of pain, and the doctor's comment about the arrows being a "plus side" is both inappropriate and insensitive. Furthermore, the doctor's comment is absurd because, even if the arrows are a work of art, the cowboy is still in pain and is going to die.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected: the doctor's positive attitude in the face of a patient who is clearly in a lot of pain. The joke is also a play on words because the arrows are Native American-crafted, and the doctor is using the word "craftsmanship" to describe both the arrows and the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is trying to find a silver lining in the fact that the cowboy has been shot by arrows. The doctor's comment about Native American craftsmanship is a play on the stereotype that all Native Americans are good at making arts and crafts.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cowboy is being sarcastic. The doctor is trying to be positive and find a silver lining, but the cowboy is clearly irritated and in pain. He's not interested in the quality of the arrows that pierced him, he just wants them out. The fact that the doctor is Missing the Point entirely just makes the joke funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non-sequitur. The doctor is trying to make a joke about how the cowboy's situation could be worse, but the joke doesn't make any sense. The doctor is probably Native American, as evidenced by the arrow, and so the joke is a play on how Native Americans are often stereotyped as being good at making arrows.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The doctor is saying that the arrows are a good example of "Native American craftsmanship" but the word "craftsmanship" can also mean the skill of a tradesman. In this case, the joke is implying that the skill of the Native American who shot the arrows is so great that the cowboy is still alive despite being impaled by many of them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is trying to find a silver lining in the cowboy being shot by arrows. The doctor is making a joke about how it's a good thing that the arrows are well-made, even though the situation is otherwise bad.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="148.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="150.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
