In this case, the joke is that the couple is ignoring the elephant so much that it has become the only thing they ever talk about.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's true: if there's a huge elephant in your living room, it's probably all you ever talk about. The joke is a play on the common saying "the elephant in the room," meaning a big issue that everyone is aware of but no one wants to talk about.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the idiom "the elephant in the room", which refers to a problem or issue that is palpable but which no one talks about because it is too taboo orpolitically incorrect. In this case, the joke is that the couple IS talking about the elephant in the room, which is ironic because it is usually something that people avoid discussing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "elephant in the room." The phrase "elephant in the room" is often used to describe a situation where there is an obvious problem that no one is talking about. In this case, the joke is that the couple is actually talking about the elephant all the time, even though it's obvious.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it brings attention to the elephant in the room, which is something that people usually try to avoid. In this case, the couple is so used to the elephant being there that it's become their default topic of conversation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it contrasts the two people's current behavior (not talking about the elephant) with what they could be doing (talking about the elephant), and points out the hypocrisy in their actions. The joke is also funny because it's true: often, the elephant in the room is something that people refuse to talk about, even though it's something that's constantly on their minds.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idiom "the elephant in the room." The phrase is used when there's an issue that everyone is aware of but no one wants to talk about. In this case, the issue is that there's a huge elephant in the room, and the woman says that they talk about it all the time, playfully subverting the idiom.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes at the idea that some people think it's best not to talk about certain topics, even though those topics are constantly on everyone's mind. In this case, the topic is the elephant in the room, which is a metaphor for a big problem that everyone is aware of but no one wants to talk about. The joke suggests that the elephant is so big and obvious that it's all the couple ever talks about, even though they're pretending it's not there.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "the elephant in the room." The phrase is used when there is an issue that everyone is aware of but nobody wants to talk about. In this case, the issue is that there is a huge elephant in their living room, but instead of nobody wanting to talk about it, the woman claims that it's all they ever talk about. The joke is funny because it is absurd; it's impossible to talk about anything else when there is a huge elephant in the room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it acknowledges the elephant in the room, which is a metaphor for a big issue that everyone is ignoring. In this case, the big issue is that there's an elephant in the room, which is so absurd that it's funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people aren't talking about the elephant in the room, which is a common idiom used to describe when people avoid a difficult issue. The joke is playing off of the fact that, if the two people were actually talking about the elephant, it would be the only thing they ever talk about.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though there is an elephant in the room that both people are ignoring, they claim that they talk about it all the time. This is ironic because, by ignoring the elephant, they are indicating that they don't want to talk about it. The joke cleverly points out the hypocrisy of their claim.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the elephant in the room is a metaphor for an issue or problem that is so huge and so obvious that it cannot be ignored, but people act like it doesn't exist. In this case, the couple is actually talking about the elephant in the room, which is unusual because people usually try to avoid the issue.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a redirect of the conversation. The man and woman are likely sitting in silence, thinking about the elephant in the room (a big problem that no one wants to talk about), when one of them breaks the silence with this joke. The joke is a clever way of saying "We're not going to talk about the elephant in the room", which is the punchline.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the elephant in the room is a metaphor for something that everyone knows about but no one wants to talk about.
