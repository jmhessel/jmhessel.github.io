The joke highlights the futility of their actions, as they are about to be wiped out and their work will be for nothing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is so bizarre that it's difficult to know how to react. The lizard monsters are not something that people are used to seeing in an office setting, so the reaction of one of the lizard monsters that he's looking forward to the day ending is relatable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "this day" can refer to both the specific day that the lizard monsters are having their meeting, as well as the generic phrase meaning "today." The lizardmonster who is bored with the meeting is looking forward to the end of the day, but also the end of today, implying that he is tired of his life and wants it to end.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the juxtaposition of dinosaurs in a business setting and the impending asteroid apocalypse. The joke plays on the stereotype of office workers being unhappy with their jobs and wanting the day to end, but in this case, the workers are actually facing an extinction-level event.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dinosaurs are acting like business people in an office, but they are dinosaurs. This is funny because dinosaurs are not known for their intelligence, so the idea of them working in an office is humorous. Furthermore, the fact that they are discussing the impending asteroid strike as if it's just another day at the office is even funnier, because it's such a nonchalant attitude to have towards something that is potentially disastrous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dinosaurs are acting like worried office workers and the asteroid is a metaphor for an impending disaster (the end of the world). The joke is clever because it plays on the idea that office workers are often stressed out and ready for the day to end, but in this case, the day ending is literal and not something they should be wishing for.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a normal statement about workdays, but in the context of lizard monsters, it takes on a whole new meaning. The speaker is implying that he is looking forward to the end of the world, when the two lizard monsters will presumably be destroyed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dinosaurs are acting like they are normal office workers, complaining about their jobs. But, of course, they are dinosaurs, and so the situation is absurd. The joke also plays on the idea that many people feel like they are working for "the man" and that their job is a soul-sucking grind.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "I can't wait for this day to end" is often used to express excitement for an upcoming event, implying that the current day is dragging. However, in this case, the speaker is actually a dinosaur, and the asteroid that's approaching Earth is the event they're excited for: the end of the world. Thus, the dinosaur is looking forward to the day ending in a literal sense, because they know that when it does, they'll be extinct.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the asteroid hitting Earth is about to destroy all life on the planet, including the two dinosaurs in the office. The fact that they are both so nonchalant about it and are just continuing on with their work day as usual is amusing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "this day" can refer to the current day that the dinosaurs are living in, which just so happens to be the day that an asteroid is going to crash into Earth and kill all the dinosaurs. However, the phrase can also refer to the end of the dinosaurs' species, which is what the asteroid is going to accomplish. Therefore, the joke is funny because the dinosaurs are unaware of their impending doom and are treating the day like any other day at the office.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lizards are worried about the meteorite, which is an event that will likely cause the end of the world. In other words, they are worried about the very thing that is supposed to happen at the end of the day. The joke casts the end of the world in a more mundane light, as just another day that people have to get through.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lizards are talking about the end of the day, as if they are office workers who are just waiting for the work day to end so they can go home. This is amusing because it's unlikely that lizards would have jobs in an office, let alone be worried about the end of the day.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dinosaurs are acting like business people who are stressed out from work and just want the day to end. However, the fact that they are dinosaurs makes the joke funnier because it's unexpected and goes against the stereotype that dinosaurs are not that intelligent.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lizards are worried about the same thing that humans typically are at the end of a long day: the end of the day. The joke plays on the fact that lizards are not typically associated with office work, but rather with outdoor activities like basking in the sun. The fact that they are sitting at a desk in an office, worrying about the day ending, is thus humorous.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="142.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="144.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
