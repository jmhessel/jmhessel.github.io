The bees joke is funny because it would be even more unusual for a person to be covered in bees, and thus, it's even more absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man covered in birds is being "attacked" by them in a sense, and the other man says "and here come the bees." This is a pun because "bees" is a homophone of "b's," as in the letter B. Thus, the first man is covered in B's, which is a reference to the fact that he is covered in birds.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non sequitur. The man covered in birds is not doing anything to attract bees, so it would be odd for bees to suddenly appear. Furthermore, the fact that the other man calmly says "and here come the bees" as if this is a totally normal thing that happens all the time makes it even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the compound word "birdfeeder" which refers to a person who feeds birds. In this case, the man being attacked by birds is acting as a birdfeeder, and the joke is that he's also attracting bees.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man covered in birds looks like he's being swarmed by bees, which would be a dangerous and unlikely situation. The fact that the man is covered in birds, instead of bees, makes it funny because it's an unexpected twist on a common phobia.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur. The man covered in birds is not doing anything to attract bees, yet, the joke introduces the possibility that bees will come. This is funny because it's unexpected and because it furthers the bizarre situation of a man being covered in birds.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it takes the scenario of one man being covered in birds to the logical extreme: instead of just birds, now bees are coming too. This is exaggerated and funny because it's not realistic: while bees may be attracted to the same things that attract birds, they wouldn't be drawn in the same way or to the same extent.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man on the bench said "here come the birds," but the bees coming close to the other man is also unexpected. Furthermore, the man covered in birds looks like he's been the victim of a prank, and the joke is that the prank is going to get worse with the bees.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non sequitur: the man covered in birds has nothing to do with bees. The joke works because of the similar sound of the words "birds" and "bees": both are animals that can fly, and they are often used in similar contexts. The joke also implies that the man covered in birds is attracting bees as well, which would be even more of a problem.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man being attacked by birds is covered in bees as well. The bees are attracted to the man because he is covered in honey. The other man's nonchalant reaction implies that this is a normal occurrence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it suggests that the person on the right, who is covered in pigeons, is also attracting other animals, in this case bees. This is humorous because it is unlikely that bees would be attracted to a person covered in pigeons.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it depicts another animal, bees, in a similar situation to the pigeons: bees are often attracted to people who are wearing flowery clothes or have recently eaten honey. The joke suggests that the person on the right is so covered in pigeons because they were eating bird seed, and now the bees are coming to get their share.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur. The man covered in birds could be interpreted as being story-teller, and the man with the book could be his audience. The story-teller is in the middle of a sentence, and the bees have nothing to do with what he was saying. The bees could be interpreted as being a metaphor for something else, but it's also possible that the story-teller is just making a joke about the bees coming after the birds.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. When one says "and here come the bees," they are usually warning the other person of an approaching danger. In this case, the approaching danger is not bees, but birds. The joke is funny because it's a pun on the similar-sounding words "birds" and "bees."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's comment about bees coming implies that getting covered in bees is a normal occurrence that happens to him often. In contrast, most people would find being covered in bees to be a very unusual and scary experience.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="142.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="144.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
