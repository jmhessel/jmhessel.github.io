The man is on the top of a church, which is a very tall building, and he is crouched down.Normally, people would expect the constant ringing of the church bells to be the worst part, but instead, the man says that it isn't. This is unexpected because it is hard to think of anything that would be worse than the constant ringing of church bells.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "ringing" can refer to the sound of a phone ringing, but it can also refer to the act of getting married. In this case, the man on the church steeple is "ringing" the woman on the balcony, meaning he is watching her and waiting for her to get off the phone so he can propose to her. The constant ringing of the phone is annoying, but it's not the worst part --- the worst part is the man's constant presence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the church steeple is implying that he's been there so long, the loud ringing of the church bells isn't the worst part. The joke is clever because it's a play on words --- the fact that he's on a church steeple in the first place implies that the ringing bells are the worst part.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the steeple is usually associated with bells, which ring at a set time or when someone pulls a rope. In this case, the ringing of the bells is the least of the man's worries, because he's in danger of falling. The joke pokes fun at the idea that someone would choose to climb to the top of a church steeple, which is a dangerous and unnecessary feat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man on top of the church is clearly struggling and the woman watering plants is making a joke about how the ringing bells must be really annoying for him. But, the joke is that the man isn't actually struggling because he's a bird; the constant ringing of the bells isn't the worst part for him because he's used to it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "constant ringing" refers to the bells of the church, which the man on top of the church is probably very familiar with at this point. The joke is that the constant ringing of the bells isn't the worst part of the man's situation; instead, it's the fact that he's so high up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is saying that the ringing of the church bells isn't the worst part of his current situation. The woman is on the phone, and the man is presumably stalking her, so the joke implies that the man is more bothered by the ringing of the church bells than he is by the fact that he's commits a possible crime.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "ringing" can refer to the sound of a church bell, which would be constant if the man is hunched over on the spire. However, the word "ringing" can also refer to the sensation of having water in one's ears, which the woman would experience if she was watering plants on a balcony near the church. The joke is clever because it combines both meanings of the word "ringing" into one punchline.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's position on top of the church steeple, while it mayhave a good view of the woman's apartment, is an extremely precarious position, and yet, the man says that the constant ringing of the church bells isn't the worst part. This implies that the worst part is yet to come, which is even more improbable given the man's dangerous position.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man on the church is being bothered by the church bells ringing; this is the "constant ringing" that he's referring to. However, the woman across the way thinks that he's referring to something else entirely: the fact that he's constantly having to urinate because he's up so high.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the woman is annoyed by the ringing of her phone, the man is in a much more precarious situation. The church steeple is a very tall building, and the man is standing on the very top of it, which is extremely dangerous. The joke is clever because it uses the word "believe" in two ways: first, in the sense that the woman on the phone won't believe how annoying the ringing is, and second, in the sense that it's hard to believe that the man is in such a high and dangerous place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's hunchbacked posture is similar to that of Quasimodo, the fictional hunchback character from Notre Dame de Paris. The joke is making a play on words, as the French word for hunchback is "quasimodo," which also happens to be the name of a church bell. Thus, the man's comment about the ringing not being the worst part is a clever way of saying that his hunchback isn't the worst part.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is on the phone and the man is on the church steeple. The man is saying that even though the constant ringing of the church bell might be annoying, it is not the worst part. The worst part is the fact that he has a bird's eye view of the woman and can see her every move.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "believe" can mean to accept something as true, or to Suspend disbelief. In this case, the woman on the balcony is telling the man on the phone that she can't believe that the hunchbacked man on the spire is still alive, despite the fact that he's been constantly ringing the bell. She's telling the man on the phone to suspend disbelief, or to stop thinking about how implausible it is that the man is still alive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is on the phone, and the man is on the church steeple. The "ringing" in the joke could refer to the church bells, which would be a constant ringing noise for the man on the steeple, or it could refer to the sound of the phone, which would be constant for the woman on the balcony. However, the joke is actually referring to the fact that, given the close proximity of the two buildings, the woman's phone conversations are probably being overheard by the man on the steeple, which is the real "constant ringing" that is bothering him.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
