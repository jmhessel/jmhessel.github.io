However, in this case, the man is pregnant and the stomach is due to the baby. The ultrasound saying it's a keg of beer is a play on the common phrase "the ultrasound says it's a boy/girl." In this case, it's saying it's a keg of beer, which is both unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Ultrasound" is a type of medical scan that is often used to determine the sex of a baby (among other things). However, in this case, the man's huge belly is so big that it looks like he's pregnant with a keg of beer, rather than a baby. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the stereotype that men who drink a lot of beer are obese.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the beer belly is so big that his colleagues are joking that he must be pregnant. The joke is funnier because it's not actually possible for a man to get pregnant. The ultrasound results just add to the absurd situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's stomach is so big that it's assumed he's pregnant. However, since men can't get pregnant, the ultrasound must be wrong, and it's actually a keg of Bud Light. The joke rely on the fact that Bud Light is a popular light beer, and that kegs are usually big and bulky.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "ultrasound" can refer to a medical procedure in which sound waves are used to create an image of the inside of the body, or it can refer to a type of sound that is very high-pitched and thus not audible to humans. In this case, the man's colleague is saying that the ultrasound shows that the man has a lot of beer in his belly, i.e., a keg.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The ultrasound is usually used to determine the sex of a baby, but in this case, it is being used to determine the contents of the man's stomach, which is a keg of Bud Light. This is clever because it is a pun on the word "light," as in light beer, which is often associated with Bud Light.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with his arms crossed doesn't look very pleased, and is probably disappointed that the other man's beer gut isn't actually a baby. The Bud Lightbrand of beer is often associated with low-quality or "cheap" beer, so this may be a further jab at the other man's expense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the ultrasound is a picture of the man'selly, which is distended because he is pregnant. The man is beer belly, which is why the ultrasound says it's a keg of Bud Light.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's distended stomach is so large that it is difficult to tell what is causing it. The ultrasound joke is a play on how pregnancy ultrasounds are used to determine the gender of a baby; in this case, however, the man's stomach is so large that it looks like he is carrying a keg of beer instead of a baby.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually when a man has a large beer gut, it is just because he enjoys drinking beer and is not pregnant. In this case, the man is actually pregnant with a keg of beer, which is why his belly is so large. This is a play on the common stereotype that men who drink beer are overweight and have large bellies.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's impossible for a man to be pregnant. The man's abdomen is so large that it's assumed he must be pregnant, but the ultrasound scan says that he's carrying a keg of Bud Light, which is far less consequential. This joke is punning on the fact that "keg" can be a unit of measurement for beer (a "keg of Bud Light"), or a container for beer.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because male pregnancy is impossible, and so the man must be either mistaken or joking. However, given that he is looking at the other man's stomach, it's plausible that he could be looking at a keg of beer, given that Bud Light is a popular brand of beer. Thus, the joke is a play on words: the man thinks he's looking at a keg of beer, when in reality, he's looking at the other man's stomach.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the man's pregnancy-like belly. Though it's technically possible for men to get pregnant, it's extremely rare, so the joke plays on the impossibility of the situation. Furthermore, the ultrasound results add another level of absurdity to the joke: instead of a baby, the ultrasound says it's a keg of beer. This punchline takes the joke from impossible to absurd, and makes it funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's large beer gut is mistaken for a pregnant belly. This is a play on the fact that men are often said to have "beer bellies." The joke is also a bit dark, as it suggests that the man is so unhealthy that his stomach has literally turned into a keg of beer.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "ultrasound." An ultrasound is a medical procedure used to image a baby in the womb, but it can also be used to image objects inside the body, such as a beer gut. In this case, the man's colleagues are joking that his distended stomach contains nothing but beer.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="75.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="77.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
