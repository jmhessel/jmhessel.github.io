Presumably, the something he wants to show is that grasshoppers can jump really high, given their size. However, the joke is also funny because it's a play on words; the other cowboy is riding a "huge" horse, so the first cowboy wants to show him a "huge" grasshopper.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the reason the other cowboy is riding a gigantic grasshopper is because he's trying to impress the first cowboy. The first cowboy is unimpressed, and is waiting to see the real reason at the next canyon. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words; "cricket" can also refer to a type of noise that grasshoppers make.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cowboy is telling the other cowboy that he will show him why he is riding a cricket. This is likely a reference to the fact that crickets can jump really high, and so the cowboy is using the cricket to get over the canyon. The irony is that the cowboy is telling the other cowboy that he will show him the reason for his unusual mode of transportation, when in reality, it's quite obvious.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="75.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="77.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
