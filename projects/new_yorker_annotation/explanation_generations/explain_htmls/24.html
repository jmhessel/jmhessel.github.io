It's also funny because the trout is a less popular fish, so the joke could be interpreted as the bear being unimpressed with the salmon and suggesting that they try something else.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Trout" is both a type of fish and a term used to mean "fool" or "idiot." The speaker is pretending to be a waiter in a restaurant and is recommending the trout fish to the customer, when in reality, they are actually recommending the customer order the idiot (trout) instead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because after the salmon are scared by the grizzly bear, the bear gives them a restaurant-style recommendation for a different type of fish. This would be a normal thing to do if the salmon were humans, but since they're fish, it's humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "trout" is both a type of fish and a word meaning "fool." In this context, the salmon is saying that the bear is a fool for thinking that he can catch them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Trout" is a type of fish that is often found in rivers, and so the man is recommending the salmon try the trout instead. But, of course, the man is also saying this because he is a trout, and so he's saying that he himself is a better option for the salmon than the grizzly bear.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the situation: it's strange enough that the bear and salmon are talking, but the salmon's recommendation of the trout is even stranger. Presumably, the salmon is telling the bear that the trout is a better option than the salmon itself, which is an ironic self-deprecating joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is saying that he "recommends the trout" but he is also saying that the salmon are "in trout." The word "trout" is a type of fish, so the man is literally recommending that the salmon try to be a different type of fish to evade being eaten by the bear. However, the word "trout" can also mean "in trouble," so the man is also saying that the salmon are currently in trouble and need to find a way out of it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the aquatic salmon and the land-dwelling grizzly bear. The salmon are in a stream, presumably swimming upstream to spawn, while the grizzly bear is on the bank of the stream, waiting to eat them. The joke also playfully pokes at the idea that trout, a common seafood, is a more "sensible" choice than salmon.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the implied comparison between the bear and the fish. Bears are typically seen as predators, while fish are seen as prey. However, in this scene, the roles are reversed: the bear is fishing, while the fish are swimming upstream to mate. The joke is that the bear is recommending the trout because it is a good meal, not because it is a good mate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is unexpected for salmon to be giving culinary recommendations to a bear. The joke could also be interpreted as the salmon being brave in the face of a predator by starting a conversation, or as the salmon being foolish because they are talking to a bear who could easily eat them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the salmon are talking to the bear, even though fish can't talk. This is a play on the common trope of animals talking to each other, with the twist being that the characters are animals that can't actually talk. The salmon's comment about the trout is also funny because it's a play on the fact that salmon and trout are both types of fish.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected for the salmon to be talking to the bear, and it's even more unexpected for the salmon to be giving the bear dietary advice. The trout is a kind of fish that is usually found in rivers, so the salmon are telling the bear to eat something that is more likely to be found in the same environment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is saying that the trout is a better choice than the salmon, but he is also saying that the trout is "out" of the water, which means that it is dead. This is a dark joke, as the man is effectively saying that the salmon are going to be killed by the bear, so they might as well be eaten.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The speaker is recommending the trout, which is a type of fish, but they are also recommending that the bear eat the trout, which is what bears typically do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in this scene, the fish are recommending a different type of fish to the bear. The joke is a play on the fact that fish are often eaten by bears, so the fact that the fish are recommending another type of fish to the bear is reversal of the typical predator/prey relationship.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="23.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="25.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
