The man's suggestion that the other man doesn't need to speak English on every shot is absurd because it's not clear how that would even be possible. The joke is made funnier by the fact that the man speaking is dressed like Charlie Chaplin, a famous silent film star.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in old clothes is speaking in a different language, but the other man still understands what he's saying. This is a play on the idea that people from different cultures can still communicate with each other, even if they don't share a common language.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because billiards is often associated with hustlers and people from shady backgrounds. The man in old clothes looks like he could be from that world. The joke is that he doesn't need to speak English to play pool, because pool is a game that can be played without speaking. This is ironic because people from shady backgrounds are often associated with not speaking standard English.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in old clothes is speaking in a different language, and the other man doesn't understand him. The language he is speaking is most likely old English, which would be difficult to understand for someone who only speaks modern English. The joke is also a play on the game of pool, where you don't need to English on every shot, meaning you don't need to put spin on the ball to make it go into the pocket.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in old clothes is named Charlie Chaplin, and he is playing pool. In English, the phrase "you don't need English on every shot" is a idiom which means "you don't need to be perfect all the time", but in this context, it's a literal instruction for pool. Charlie Chaplin was a famous actor known for his films in the early 1900s, so the joke is also a play on the fact that he is from a different era.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because pool is typically a game that is played with people speaking English. However, the man in old clothes and hat looks like he is from a time period when people didn't speak English, or at least not as commonly. Thus, the joke is that he doesn't need to speak English to play pool, because he is from a time before it was necessary.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in old clothes is speaking in a foreign language. This is a reference to the movie "The Immigrant" where Charlie Chaplin's character speaks in a fake foreign accent. The man in the old clothes is speaking in a similar accent, and the joke is that he doesn't need to speak English to play pool.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because while playing billiards, people usually don't need to be English to make a shot. However, in this particular situation, because the man is dressed in old-world English clothes, it seems like he is trying to be English on every shot. The joke is a play on the stereotype that English people are stuffy and pretentious.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Englishman's clothing is old-fashioned and out of place in the modern day pool hall. The joke is a play on the fact that the English language is also old-fashioned and out of place in many modern contexts.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Englishman's attire is anachronistic, and cue sports are not typically associated with England. The joke suggests that the Englishman is overcompensating for his lack of ability at the game by dressing in an Englishman's outfit.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because pool is typically played with American-English words and phrases, such as "side pocket" and "corner pocket". However, the man in old clothes is playing with British-English words and phrases, such as "rear pocket" and "blackball". This confusion is compounded by the fact that the other man does not seem to understand what the first man is saying.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at the man's outfit. He is dressed in a very old-fashioned way, which suggests he is from a time when pool was not as popular. However, the man is still playing pool, which means he obviously knows the game. The joke is that, even though he is from a time when pool was not as well-known, he doesn't need to use proper English on every shot, because he knows how to play the game.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "You don't need English on every shot" can mean two things in this context. First, it could be interpreted to mean that the man doesn't need to put spin on the ball (i.e., hit it with the English), which is a technique used in pool. Second, it could be interpreted to mean that the man doesn't need to speak English in order to play pool, which is clearly not the case given the man's appearance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in old clothes looks out of place in the pool hall. He is dressed like someone from a different era, and his clothing suggests he is English. Thus, the joke is that he doesn't need to speak English in order to play pool, even though he looks like he would.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it uses a double-meaning of the word "shot." In pool, a "shot" is a specific type of move where the player hits the cue ball with a stick in order to make it hit another ball into a pocket. However, the other meaning of "shot" is a small amount of liquor, usually drunk quickly. Thus, the joke is saying that the man doesn't need to speak English (i.e., be clear and concise) in order to take his shot, because he can just drink liquor instead.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
