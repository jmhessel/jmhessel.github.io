The idea of death being brought to court and having to answer for his actions is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in nearly all contexts, death is seen as inevitable and inescapable. The fact that the lawyer's client is Death personified makes the joke even funnier, because it implies that even Death can be brought down by charges of tax evasion. The joke also playfully pokes at the complexity of the American tax code.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because even though the Grim Reaper is technically deceased, he is still being charged with tax evasion. The joke is clever because it playfully pokes fun at the legal system's shortcomings: even death cannot escape the long arm of the law.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The lawyer is talking to Death, who, in this case, has been charged with tax evasion. The lawyer is surprised that Death would be caught for something like that, but of course, Death is the personification of death, so he is, logically, impossible to catch or charge with anything.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because tax evasion is usually associated with people who are trying to avoid paying their fair share, i.e., people who are alive. The fact that the Grim Reaper is being charged with tax evasion is humorous because, obviously, the Grim Reaper does not pay taxes because he/she/it is death itself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the client is Death, and tax evasion is often thought of as a victimless crime. In this case, however, the lawyer is joking that even Death can be caught for tax evasion.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Grim Reaper, as a personification of death, is not subject to the laws of mortals. The idea of him being charged with tax evasion is absurd because he is not bound by human laws. The joke is a play on the fact that death is often seen as inevitable and inescapable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because tax evasion is a common crime that people get charged with, but it's unexpected in the context of the Grim Reaper. The joke is also funny because, while the Grim Reaper is often thought of as being "above the law," in this case, they are being held accountable for breaking the law.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, as the personification of death, the grim reaper is outside the scope of earthly laws. To be caught and tried for tax evasion implies that the grim reaper is submit to the same taxes as mortals, which is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because tax evasion is often considered a victimless crime, and it's usually something that people only get in trouble for if they're caught. But, in this case, the client is Death, who is personification of death itself. So, the joke is funny because it's unexpected that even Death would get in trouble for tax evasion.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Grim Reaper, as the personification of death, is surrounded by death tax, which is a tax on inherited property. The joke is that, even though he is the personification of death, he still can't escape being taxed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The client is death, who evades taxes by, well, dying. So the lawyer's statement that death got caught for tax evasion is a clever way of saying that death got what was coming to him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Grim Reaper is being tried for tax evasion, which is a crime that is often associated with humans. The fact that the Grim Reaper, who personifies death, is being tried for this crime is ironic and unexpected, which makes it humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Grim Reaper, who is personification of death, is being tried for tax evasion. The lawyer is surprised that the Reaper would be caught for such a mundane offense, when one would think that the Reaper would be above the law.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because tax evasion is often considered a victimless crime, and the fact that even the Grim Reaper can be caught for it emphasizes how ubiquitous tax evasion is. Additionally, the fact that the Grim Reaper is being tried in a court of law is humorous because he is, in fact, death personified, and thus above the law.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="30.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="32.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
