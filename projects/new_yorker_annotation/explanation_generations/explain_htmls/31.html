The fact that he's already familiar with the side effects of the medication he's buying implies that he's had to deal with the noise his hooves make in the past, and is thus used to it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The side effects the pharmacist is referring to are the usual side effects of the medication, but in this case, they are also the side effects of being a centaur.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The side effects the centaur is referring to are the side effects of the medication, but the other meaning of side effects is consequences. In this case, the side effect of the centaur being in the store is that the clerk is probably going to get fired.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the side effects of the medication are unwanted changes to the body, and the centaur already has an unnatural body, so the side effects must be especially bad for him. The woman giving him the medication is aware of this, and her comment suggests that she has seen him in the pharmacy before and knows that he is struggling with the side effects.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The side effects of the medication are that the patient may experience excessive flatulence, and the horse-man is already familiar with this side effect because he is PASSING GAS.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the side effects of many medications are listed on the containers, and the worker at the store probably couldn't read them even if they were in English. The fact that the centaur is already familiar with the side effects implies that he's been taking the medication for a while, and that he doesn't need to read the side effects because he already knows them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the side effects of the medication being given to the centaur are already evident: the centaur is half man, half horse. Thus, the pharmacist is remarking that the centaur is probably already quite familiar with the side effects of the medication, given that they are living proof of them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the fact that the horse part of the centaur is on the side, making it look like the horse is already familiar with the side effects of the medicine.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The side effects of the medication the centaur is taking are the same as the side effects of being a centaur: for example, the medication may cause him to grow an extra set of legs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the pharmacy is a place where people usually go to get medicine to help with some sort of ailment or issue they are having. The half man half horse is a mythical creature, so the joke is that the person is already familiar with the side effects of the medicine, because they are a mythical creature and have probably taken the medicine before.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The half man, half horse is called a centaur, and the medicine the pharmacist is giving him is for an infection called centauriasis. The side effects of the medication are, ironically, the same as the symptoms of the infection: fatigue, headaches, and joint pain.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the centaur, a mythical creature, is experiencing the side effects of the medication, which are already familiar to him. This is because, as a mythical creature, he is not subject to the same laws of physics and biology as humans, and thus is not affected by the medication in the same way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's play on the fact that the centaur is a mythical creature. The side effects of the medication are typically things that happen to real people, but because the centaur is not a real creature, the pharmacist is implying that the side effects are things that happen to mythical creatures.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the pharmacist is trying to hand the bottle of medicine to the centaur, the centaur is trying to grab it with his mouth. This implies that the centaur is already familiar with the side effects of the medicine, which is probably not something that the pharmacist intended.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the centaur is so used to the side effects of the medicine that he doesn't need to read the label. The centaur is probably taking the medicine for some sort of chronic condition, and the fact that he is so nonchalant about the side effects is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
