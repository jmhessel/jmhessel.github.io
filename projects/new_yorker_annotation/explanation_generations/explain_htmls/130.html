This is because, on a small island, there wouldn't be a need for someone who does air conditioning; a plumber would be more useful. The stranded man is surprised because he's not actually hallucinating, yet he's seeing something that he wouldn't expect to see.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is stranded on the island is clearly in need of assistance, but the plumber is only equipped to help with plumbing-related issues. The man stranded on the island is probably hoping for someone who can help him get off the island, but the plumber is not that person.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the plumber is hallucinating, which is why he's seeing a man who looks like he's stranded on an island. The fact that the plumber is seeing someone who does air conditioning is strange, because it's not something that would be necessary on an island.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the plumber is approaching the stranded man on the island, he is clearly not going to be able to do anything to help him. The stranded man is stranded because he is on an island, and there is no need for plumbing on an island. The plumber is imagining a guy who does air conditioning, which would be much more useful in this scenario.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the island isirrationaly asking for someone who does air conditioning, a service that would be utterly useless on a deserted island where there is no power source for the AC unit. The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur: the man's request doesn't make sense given the situation he's in.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man on the island is hallucinating, because there's no way a plumber would come out of the ocean. He's wishing he was hallucinating a guy who does air conditioning, because that would be more useful in this hot, humid environment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a typical hallucination, a person might see something that's not really there, like a plumber. But in this case, the woman stranded on the island isn't seeing something that's not there, she's seeing something that is there, but that doesn't make any sense given the context. She would prefer to see someone who could help her in her situation, like someone who does air conditioning, but instead she's seeing a plumber.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the plumber is suggesting that, instead of the typical hallucination of a beautiful woman, it would be more helpful if he hallucinated a man who could fix his air conditioner. This is funny because it suggests that the plumber is more interested in functional things (like a working air conditioner) than in aesthetically pleasing things (like a beautiful woman).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words; "hallucinate" can mean to imagine something that isn't really there, or it can mean to have a false vision. So, in this case, the plumber is hoping to have a false vision of a man who does air conditioning, because there would be no need for plumbing on a small island.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the stranded man on the small island is clearly in need of help, but the plumber is only equipped to help with plumbing, not with the situation the stranded man is in. The stranded man is therefore unlikely to get the help he needs from the plumber.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the island is isolated and his only contact with the outside world is a plumber who has come to fix his air conditioning. The joke is funny because it's a play on words --- the man is "hallucinating" a plumber, but what he's really seeing is a figment of his imagination. In other words, he's making up the fact that there's a plumber there, when there isn't really one.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is so surprised to see a plumber, even though she's stranded on an island with no plumbing, that she wishes she could hallucinate someone who could do something more useful, like air conditioning. This is absurd because, even if there was someone on the island who could do air conditioning, it would be just as useless as a plumber.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is stranded on a small island with no plumbing, so the appearance of a plumber is nonsensical. She's hallucinating, and it would make more sense for her to hallucinate someone who could provide her with a more pressing need, like air conditioning, rather than plumbing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is stranded on the island is probably desperate for any kind of help, and so the plumber is a welcome sight. However, the fact that the plumber is a hallucination means that the man stranded on the island is not actually going to get the help he needs. This is a play on the common phrase "I'd like to see that," which is often used to express doubt.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is stranded on an island, and so the best possible scenario for him would be if aHallucination of a guy who does air conditioning came, since it would be so hot on the island. However, instead, he gets a plumber, which while still helpful, is not as good as someone who could fix his air conditioning.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="129.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="131.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
