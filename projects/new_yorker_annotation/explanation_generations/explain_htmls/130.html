In this case, the question is directed at an empty suit, which obviously can't answer, raising the question of who or what is really on trial here.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a traditional courtroom setting, the accused person is present to defend themselves against the charges. Here, the accused has apparently escaped or become invisible, so the prosecutor has to ask the questions to the empty chair. The joke is a play on the traditional opening line of the prosecutor in a hearing, "Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the Communist party?", which is adapted to the current situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the McCarthy hearings, in which people were asked if they were communist sympathizers. The joke is funny because, in this case, the person on trial has escaped, so the question of whether or not they are guilty is moot.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="129.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="131.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
