The first way is that the waiter is telling the customer about some "specials" that the restaurant has, which are usually not printed on the menu. The second way is that the waiter is telling the customer about some dishes that the restaurant doesn't have, but they could make an exception for him. The third way is that the waiter is trying to sell the customer something that isn't food, like drugs or sex. All of these interpretations are funny because they are unexpected: the customer is sitting in a restaurant, looking at a menu, and expecting to order food, but the waiter has other things in mind.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's menu is so large that it's difficult for him to find what he wants. The joke implies that the waiter is going to suggest items that aren't on the menu, and the man will be so overwhelmed that he won't be able to choose. This is a play on the common restaurant experience of feeling overwhelmed by the menu and not knowing what to order.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the menu is so large, that the waiter can't even list off all of the items that are available. This would be frustrating for customers, who may not know what they want, but also don't have the time to look through an exhaustive list.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it subverts the expectation that when a waiter/ waitress hands someone a menu, they will simply pick an item off the list. In this case, the man wants to know about items that aren't even offered, which suggests that he either has very specific dietary restrictions or is just very picky.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the way it subverts the expected behavior of a waiter. Usually, waiters will go over the items that are on the menu with customers, but in this case, the waiter is offering to tell the customer about items that aren't on the menu. The menu is already so giant that it's unlikely the customer will be able to pick anything, so the waiter's suggestion is even more absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected. The waiter is essentially asking the customer if he wants to know about things that the restaurant doesn't have, which is just wasting the customer's time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The waiter is asking if the man wants to know about menu items that are "specials" and not listed on the menu, or if he wants to know about dishes that the restaurant offers but are not represented on the menu because they're not available at the moment. However, the fact that the menu is so large implies that there are probably a lot of dishes that aren't on the menu, so the waiter's offer to tell the man about them is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that often, waiting staff will make suggestions to customers about items that are not on the menu. In this case, the customer has so many items to choose from that the waiter suggests that he just order items that are not on the menu.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is so overwhelmed by the size of the menu that he's asking the waiter for help in choosing what to order. This is ironic because, usually, it is the waiter's job to make suggestions about what to order, but in this case, the customer is asking the waiter for suggestions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter is offering items that aren't actually on the menu to the customer, suggesting that the restaurant has something special or hidden that they can offer that other restaurants don't have. Of course, since the items aren't on the menu, it's likely that the waiter is just making them up, but the customer doesn't know that.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it suggests that the waiter is going to start listing off different food items that the restaurant offers, but instead, he's going to talk about things that are not food. This could be because the restaurant is out of the food items that the man wants, or because the waiter is just messing with him. Either way, it's unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the menu is so large that it's impossible to tell what's on it and what's not. The waiter is offering to clue the man in on a few items that aren't on the menu, as if there are secret menu items that the restaurant offers. The joke is clever because it's a play on words --- the "items" the waiter is talking about aren't food items, but rather, things that happen in the restaurant that aren't listed on the menu, like the possibility of getting food poisoning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter is offering to tell the man about items that the restaurant doesn't have, which is the opposite of what a waiter is supposed to do. Most likely, the waiter is going to tell the man about items that are off-limits or not available, rather than trying to sell the man something.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually when a waiter tells a customer about "items that aren't on the menu," they are referring to specialties that the restaurant offers that are not listed. However, in this case, the waiter is humorously referring to the fact that the menu is so large that there are bound to be some items not listed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is reading the menu, and the waiter is asking if he can tell him about a few items off the menu. TheItems that the waiter is talking about are not literal food items, but rather, special services or offerings that the restaurant has. This could be anything from a special discount to a place to stay for the night.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="129.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="131.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
