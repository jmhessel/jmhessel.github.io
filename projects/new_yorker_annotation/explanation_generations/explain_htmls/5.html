The man who is juggling chainsaws is presumably a politician, and the phrase "make the middle class disappear" is a common political talking point used by both left- and right-wing politicians. In this case, the man is literally making the middle class (i.e., the people in the room) disappear by juggling the chainsaws and scaring them away.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Disappear" can mean to make something vanish, like a magic trick. However, it can also mean to kill someone. The man behind the podium is telling the juggler to show the audience how he makes the middle class disappear, i.e., how he kills them. This is a dark joke about how the rich get richer by eliminating the middle class.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the juggler is putting on a dangerous and potentially deadly performance, and the second man is telling the third man to use this as an example of how the middle class disappears. The implication is that the middle class is being dismantled and destroyed in a haphazard and dangerous way, just like the juggler is playing with the chainsaws.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because at first, it seems like the man on the podium is giving instructions to his opponent on how to win the debate. However, the joke is actually on the man on the podium, because the way to "make the middle class disappear" is by juggling chainsaws --- in other words, the man on the podium is telling his opponent to do something that is impossible, which makes him look foolish.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in a debate or speech, the goal is usually to make reasoned and logical arguments to win over the audience. However, the man onstage is being upstaged by the man juggling chainsaws, who is clearly not interested in making a reasoned argument. The joke suggests that the only way to win against such an opponent is to resort to underhanded tactics.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man juggling the chainsaws is doing a dangerous job that is metaphorically representative of how the middle class is "disappearing." The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the man is literally making the middle class "disappear" by juggling the chainsaws, but he is also figuratively making the middle class "disappear" by doing something that is dangerous and frowned-upon.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because chainsaws are commonly used by middle class people to do yard work. The image of a man juggling chainsaws is thus a play on the saying "the rich get richer and the poor get poorer." The joke implies that the man behind the podium is a politician who is telling the juggler to put on a show that will make the middle class disappear, represent the trend of economic inequality.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because juggling is often associated with magicians, who make things disappear. In this case, the man is juggling chainsaws, which are dangerous weapons. The joke is that the man is going to make the middle class disappear, i.e., hurt them badly, just like how a chainsaw can hurt someone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man behind the podium is whispering to the other man about how to "make the middle class disappear". The juggler in front of them is doing a very dangerous act, which could potentially maim or kill him, and the man behind the podium is using this as an example of how to get rid of the middle class. The joke is clever because it is a play on the phrase "make them disappear", which typically means to kill someone. Here, the man behind the podium is suggesting a more literal interpretation of the phrase.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the podium is trying to give a serious speech about the economy, while his opponent isperforming a dangerous circus trick. The joke implies that the opponent is so preoccupied with putting on a show that he doesn't care about the content of the debate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man behind the podium is whispering to the other man about how to win the debate, and his suggestion is to "make the middle class disappear". This is a play on the phrase "make them disappear", which would mean to make your opponents in the debate disappear (i.e. lose), but in this context, the man behind the podium is suggesting that the middle class literally disappears. The Juggler is doing a dangerous juggling act with chainsaws, which represents how the middle class is being decimated.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because class warfare is often a key issue in political debates. The fact that one of the participants is literally juggling chainsaws suggests that he is trying to make a spectacle of himself rather than actually debating the issues. The joke implies that the man on the podium is more interested in winning the debate by any means necessary, even if it means resorting to underhanded tactics.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is juggling the chainsaws is a metaphor for how the rich get richer while the middle class disappears. The man whispering is telling the other man to show the audience how he can make the middle class disappear, by continuing to juggle the chainsaws and not let anyone in the middle class get ahold of them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is trying to give a speech about how to help the middle class, but his opponent is showboating and not paying attention. The joke implies that the best way to make the middle class disappear is to have them vote for thechainsaw-juggling candidate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. When the man on the platform says "show them how you make the middle class disappear", he's telling the man next to him to show the audience how he can make the middle class disappear through his policies. However, the man next to him is juggling chainsaws, so the literal interpretation of the phrase is to show the audience how he can make the middle class disappear through his dangerous and foolhardy skills with chainsaws.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="4.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="6.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
