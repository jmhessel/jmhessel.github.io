So, the scientist is saying that the only reason he's doing his research is for the food (bread) that the ducks will provide. This joke also pokes fun at the stereotype of scientists being in it for the money/grants rather than for the good of humanity/science.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "I'm only in it for the money." The speaker is a duck, which are often associated with bread (because of the popular brand of duck food, "Breaded Duck"). So, by saying "I'm only in it for the bread," the duck is saying that it is only interested in the food, not the science.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the fact that "ducks" and "bread" are both food items. In this context, the person is saying that they are only in the lecture hall/classroom for the food (bread) and not for any other reason. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the phrase "I'm only in it for the money", which is often used to describe people who are not interested in the actual work they are doing, but only in the financial compensation.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="4.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="6.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
