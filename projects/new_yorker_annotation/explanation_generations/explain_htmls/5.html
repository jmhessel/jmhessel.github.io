The joke is also funny because it playfully pokes at the idea that corporate bosses often ask their employees where they see themselves in the company in order to gauge their ambitions and commitment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common interview question, "where do you see yourself in five years?" The joke suggests that the person being interviewed will still be sitting in the same row of chairs, i.e., they won't have moved up in the company at all. This is ironic because most people would ideally like to be promoted within five years, so the joke implies that the person being interviewed is not ambitious.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in the context of having too many chairs, it's a play on the common interview question "Where do you see yourself in five years?" The question is usually asked to gauge a person's long-term goals and ambition, but in this context, it's a nonsensical question because there's no way to move five chairs forward without displacing other chairs first.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common interview question "Where do you see yourself in five years?" The joke substitutes "chairs" for "years" which changes the meaning of the question entirely. Instead of asking about the person's career goals, it is now a question about whether the person plans on sitting in all the chairs in the office. The joke is clever because it is a play on words that changes the meaning of a common question.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person asking the question is implying that the person seated in the back will never make it to the front, despite the fact that there are too many chairs in the room. The joke is a play on words, as the person asking the question is technically asking about the other person's career goals, but the question can also be interpreted to mean "Where will you be sitting five chairs from now?"</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is sitting in the back of a row of chairs, and the CEO is asking him where he sees himself in the future. The joke is clever because it uses the double-meaning of "five chairs": in the literal sense, the CEO is asking the man where he sees himself in the next five chairs (i.e., in the next seat), but in the more figurative sense, the CEO is asking the man where he sees himself in the company in the next five years.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully pokes at the trope of a boss asking an employee during a performance review where they see themselves in the company in the future. The joke is clever because, in this specific instance, the person being asked is literally five chairs away from the boss, so the answer is quite clear.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man behind the desk is asking the other man where he sees himself in the future, but the fact that there is a row of chairs between them means that the man behind the desk is actually asking the man to move five chairs closer. This is a clever way of telling the man to move closer so they can talk more easily.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man behind the desk is asking the other man a question that is common in job interviews, but the context of the question is strange because they are in an office and not a job interview. The joke is also funny because it playfully pokes at the ridiculousness of the question itself: it is not realistic to expect someone to know where they will be five chairs from now.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common interview question, "Where do you see yourself in five years?" The chairs are an unexpected addition, and the interviewee's response of "five chairs from now" is a clever way of sidestepping the question.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man behind the desk is asking the other man where he sees himself in the future, in a literal sense. The man in the foreground is sitting in a row of chairs, and the man behind the desk is asking him where he sees himself in five chairs from now. This is funny because it's a play on the common idiom "where do you see yourself five years from now," which is usually asked in job interviews. In this case, the man behind the desk is asking the question in a literal way, which is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is sitting at the back of a row of chairs. This implies that he is waiting in line for something, even though he is in an office. The joke is also funny because it playfully pokes at how people often ask others during job interviews where they see themselves in the future, as if the future is some kind of line that can be queued up for.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is asking the other man where he sees himself in the future, but the fact that there is a line of chairs gives the question a double meaning. The man could be asking where the other man sees himself in the future in terms of profession or social status, or he could be literally asking where the other man sees himself sitting in five chairs from now.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man behind the desk is asking the other man where he sees himself in the future, but the fact that there is a line of chairs implies that the man is asking where the other man sees himself in line. This is humorous because it is a subtle way of telling the man that he is not important and will have to wait his turn.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, instead of asking the man where he sees himself in five years, the man behind the desk asks him where he sees himself in five chairs. This is humorous because it suggests that the man's future is not very bright, and also because it's a play on words (i.e., "queue" instead of "years").</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="4.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="6.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
