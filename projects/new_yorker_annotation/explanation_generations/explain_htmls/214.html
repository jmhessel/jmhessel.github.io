You mother worries.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the picture is worried about the hand coming out of the clouds, but the joke is that the man's mother is actually the one who is worried. The joke is clever because it uses the fact that the hand in the clouds could be interpreted as either a hand of God or a mother's hand.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the image of God giving Moses a turtleneck sweater is surprising and humorous. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "take it" can mean either to accept the sweater or to follow the commandment. In this case, God is telling Moses to take the sweater to help keep him warm, but he is also telling Moses to take the commandment, which is to follow God's will.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common parental advice to "dress warmly" when going outside in cold weather. In this case, the "parent" is God, and the "child" is Moses. The joke is also funny because it's a bit of a reversal; usually, it's the child who is given advice by the parent, but in this case, it's the parent who is giving advice to the child.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Moses is being given a very modern looking jacket by the hand of God, which is anachronistic. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the phrase "take it or leave it." In this case, Moses is being told to take the jacket, because if he doesn't, his mother will worry. The joke is clever because it's a double meaning: either Moses should take the jacket to please his mother, or he should take the jacket because it's a commandment from God.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because God is giving Moses a sweater, which is a modern article of clothing. This is anachronistic, because Moses lived many years ago and sweaters weren't invented yet. Additionally, the sweater is likely expensive, and God is telling Moses to take it because his mother worries about him. The joke is clever because it's a play on the fact that Moses was given the Ten Commandments by God on Mount Sinai.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "take it" can mean both to accept the sweater that the hand is offering, or to accept the commandments that Moses is offering. The mother presumably wants her son to take the sweater to keep warm, but the son is more interested in taking the commandments, which are a far more serious matter. The juxtaposition of the two meanings of "take it" is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "take it" can mean either to accept the offer of the sweater or to accept the offer of the ten commandments. In either case, the mother is worried, but for different reasons: in the first case, she's worried about her son being cold on the mountain top, and in the second case, she's worried about her son being judged by God. The double meaning of "take it" is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idea that God is all-knowing and all-powerful. In this case, God knows that Moses' mother is worried about him, so he gives him a jacket to keep him warm. This joke is also funny because it's a reversal of the common trope where a parent tells their child to take a jacket because they will be cold.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "take it" can be read as both a suggestion that Moses should take the sweater to keep warm, but also as a instruction to Moses to take the sweater because his mother, who is presumably in heaven, worries that he's cold. The idea that God would be worried about Moses' mother's opinion is amusing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In this context, "take it" could mean either to take the sweater that the hand is offering, or to take the Commandments that Moses is being given. The fact that the man's mother is worried implies that she wants him to take the sweater to keep him warm, but the man is more concerned with taking the Commandments.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idea that "God helps those who help themselves." In this case, Moses is being given a literal helping hand by God in the form of a jacket. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the idea that God is a parental figure who is looking out for Moses' welfare.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The hand of God is offering Moses a sweater, which in this context is a piece of clothing, but the word "sweater" can also mean a person who is overprotective, typically a mother. So, the hand of God is saying that Moses should take the sweater to wear, and also that he should take it because his mother is too overprotective.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common phrase "Your mother worries about you," which is usually said to someone as a way to convince them to take an offered item of clothing or as a general way of saying that someone else is looking out for them. In this case, however, the phrase is being said by God to Moses, which gives it a humorous twist.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The hand of God is giving Moses a jacket, which in colloquial English, can be referred to as a "sweater". The joke is that God is telling Moses to take the sweater to stop his mother from worrying, but in this case, the sweater is actually a physical object that will keep him warm.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that Moses is often depicted as being very old; in this joke, God is telling Moses to take the jacket because his mother is worried about him being cold. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the idea that God is all-knowing; in this joke, he knows that Moses' mother is worried about him.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="213.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="215.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
