The scientists' observation that the mouse is unable to understand the maze exercise is a clever way of pointing out the mouse's lack of intelligence, in contrast to its cheat of using a jetpack.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the scientists are observing the mouse's behavior in the maze, the mouse is blatantly cheating by using a jetpack. The scientists' notes on the mouse's behavior make it seem like they don't realize the mouse is cheating, and are instead just commenting on its inability to navigate the maze, which is amusing.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="213.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="215.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
