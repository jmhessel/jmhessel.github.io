The first place cops look is in the trunk.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The bucket that the man's feet are stuck in is usually called a "bucket of water," but in this context, it's a "cement bucket." Cement is a type of building material that is used to make concrete; when it hardens, it is very difficult to break. Thus, by putting the man's feet in a bucket of cement, it will be very difficult for him to escape. The joke is clever because it's a play on words that changes the meaning of a common object.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man who is tied up is named Eddie. The phrase "the first place cops look" can mean either that it's the first place they should look because it's the most likely place to find evidence, or it's the first place they look because it's the easiest place to look. In this case, it's the latter: the man is tied up in the trunk because it's the easiest place to put him, not because it's the best place to hide him from the police.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men are discussing how to dispose of a body, and the first man suggests putting the body in the trunk of the car. However, the second man points out that this is not a good idea, because the first place that the police will look is in the trunk. The hood of the car is a much better place to hide the body, because it's less obvious.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is driving has put the man who is restrained on the hood of the car, instead of in the trunk. The driver says that it's smart because it's harder for the police to spot someone on the hood of a car than in the trunk. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the man on the hood is actually "trunk"ing the car.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "smart" can mean both "intelligent" and "well-dressed." In this context, the word "smart" means "intelligent," as in the guy who came up with the idea to put the body in the bucket of water is smart because he knows the cops will look in the trunk for a body. However, the fact that the body is Smart, with a capital S, suggests that the man's name is Smart, which is a homonym for "smart." This makes the joke a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men have apparently kidnapped a clown, and one of them has tied him to the hood of the car in an attempt to make it more difficult for the clown to escape. However, the other man points out that this is actually a bad idea, since the first place that police will look for a missing person is in the trunk. Thus, they might as well have just put the clown in the trunk in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "trunk" has two meanings: the first is the storage area of a car, and the second is the body part (i.e. the trunk of a tree). In the context of the joke, the man is saying that it would be smarter to put the body in the storage area (the trunk) of the car, rather than leaving it out in the open for everyone to see. However, the fact that the body is cemented to the hood suggests that this person was not given a choice in the matter.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is tied up on the car is in a very compromising and dangerous position. If the police were to find him, they would most likely assume that he was put there against his will and would investigate further. However, the man in the car says that it was smart to put him there because the first place that the police would look for him would be in the trunk of the car. This is unexpected because it is not a safe or logical place to hide someone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men have apparently cemented the clown's feet to the car hood in order to hide him from the police. The fact that they thought to do this is strange, and the fact that it would actually work is even stranger. The joke is clever because it playfully pokes at the stereotype that criminals are not very smart.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in most cases, when a person is tied up on a car, it's because they've been kidnapped and the kidnappers are trying to hide them. However, in this case, the man has been tied up on top of the car, which is the opposite of what most people would do. The man in the car says it's smart because, in most cases, the first place police would look for a missing person would be in the trunk of a car. However, in this case, the man is tied up on top of the car, so the police would never think to look there.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's body position makes it clear that he has been tied to the hood of the car in order to be killed and his body disposed of. However, the man's friend Eddie points out that the cops will look in the trunk for the body, not on the hood of the car. This is a play on the idea that criminals are not always the smartest people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in this scenario, it would be better to put the man in the trunk rather than tying him to the hood of the car. The fact that the man is tied to the hood suggests that the people who put him there are not very bright, and the joke is pointing out their stupidity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is tied up and on the hood of the car is in a dangerous and precarious position, and the other man jokes that it's a good thing he isn't in the trunk. This is a reference to the stereotype that criminals will put bodies in the trunks of their cars. The fact that the man is joking about the dangerous situation the other man is in highlights the absurdity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who put the body in the bucket of water is trying to be clever by hiding the body in the front of the car rather than in the trunk. However, the person who made the joke is saying that this is not clever because the first place that the police will look for a body is in the trunk.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men have put the man on the hood of the car rather than in the trunk, which is where one would typically hide a body. The speaker seems to be sarcastic, implying that it wasn't smart of them to put the body in such an obvious place.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="213.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="215.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
