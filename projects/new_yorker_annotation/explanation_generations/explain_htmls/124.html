In this context, the word "coasters" can mean two things: first, it can mean a disc or pad placed under a beverage to protect the surface of the table (this is the more common usage); second, it can mean a type of small vehicle (like a roller coaster or a go-cart) that someone could use to get around. In the context of the scene, where there are chairs on the table, the man is asking if the people would at least use the small vehicles to get around instead of walking on the table. This is funny because it's a non-sensical request.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is not asking the others to use coasters to protect the surface of the table from water rings, but rather he is asking them to use coasters, which are small, round pieces of cardboard that are placed under drinks to protect tables. However, in this situation, the coasters are being used as chairs, which is an unusual use for them, and the man is asking the others to use them correctly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is looking at the table from below, as if he is a scale model of a person. This would be strange in any circumstance, but it's made funnier by the fact that he is also scolding the people at the meeting for not using coasters, as if he is a real person who is just very short.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the chair on the floor is telling the other three people to stop putting their feet on the conference table, because it is impolite and leaves marks. However, the other three people are not actually doing that: they are sitting on top of the conference table, as if it were a giant chair. The man on the floor is essentially telling them to stop putting their feet on a giant chair, which is a nonsensical request.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is sitting on a table, which is furniture that is meant to be sat on, and he is being asked to use coasters, which are meant to protect furniture from water damage. The joke is clever because it's a play on words; the man is being asked to use coasters as if he were a drink, when in reality, he is the one who should be using them to protect the furniture.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The speaker is telling the people sitting on the table to use coasters, which are small pieces of cardboard or paper placed under drinks to protect the surface of the table. But in this case, the speaker is telling the people to "coast" down from the table, as in, stop sitting on the table and sit in chairs like normal people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is looking at the meeting from below, as if he's a fly on the wall, but the woman is telling him off as if he's a real person. In this context, the word "coasters" would normally refer to physical objects that are placed under drinks to protect the surface of the table from water damage. However, in this context, the word "coasters" is also a synonym for "ears," which is what a fly on the wall would use to listen in on a conversation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the fact that people are sitting on top of the table instead of in chairs around it. Because they're not using coasters, it's implied that they're just sitting on the table, which is considered rude in many social contexts. The joke is funnier if the people sitting on the table are senior to the person speaking to them, since it would be even ruder for them to be sitting on the table in that case.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because people are sitting on the table instead of chairs, and the person who is telling the joke is complaining about them not using coasters. The joke is clever because, while it is true that you should use coasters to protect furniture from water damage, the people sitting on the table are not drinking anything.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person is asking for a very small courtesy --- using coasters to protect the wood on the table --- and yet, the people are sitting on the table instead of in chairs around it. It's a small request, but it's still a legitimate request considering the disrespect the people are showing to the furniture.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is clearly not sitting at the table, but instead is sitting on a chair below the table. This means that he is not at the same level as the other participants in the meeting, and is thus not contributing in the same way. The joke is telling him to contribute in a more functional way by using coasters to prevent the table from getting damaged.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "coaster" can refer to two different things: 1) a small disk that is placed under a beverage to protect furniture from water damage, or 2) a small scale model of a larger object. In the context of the scene, the man in the chair on the floor is asking the other people to use coasters (the furniture protection disks), but the way he words it implies that he thinks they should be using coasters (the scale models) instead. This is funny because it's a silly request given the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the chair on the floor is suggesting that the other three people in the meeting use coasters to protect the table from their drinks. However, the fact that they are sitting in chairs on top of the table means that they are already protecting the table, by not putting their drinks directly on it. The joke is a play on words, with the man in the floor chair using the word "coaster" to mean both a drink coaster and a miniature replica of a ship or other object, which are also often used to protect furniture.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The meaning of "coaster" can refer to a small disk used to protect furniture from water stains, or it can refer to a type of ride at a amusement park. In this case, the speaker is telling the people sitting on the table to use coasters to protect the table, but the people are ignoring him and instead are enjoying the ride.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people sitting on the table are not using coasters, and as a result, they are leaving water rings on the wood. The person who made the joke is saying that, if they're going to sit on the table, they at least should use coasters to avoid damage to the furniture.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="123.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="125.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
