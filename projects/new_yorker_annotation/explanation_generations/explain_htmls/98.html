In the rat's world, a pigeon is only worth 5 if it's a statue, 25 if it's a newly washed car, and 125 if it's an investment portfolio manager. This valuation system is absurd, and it's funny because it's so different from the standard way of valuing things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the pigeon is asking the rat to clarify what he said, implying that the pigeon didn't understand the rats earlier statement. However, the statement the pigeon didn't understand was about something very mundane (statues, cars, and investment portfolio managers), while the rat is talking about something that is very unusual (a rat with fake bat wings). This juxtaposition is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idiom "to kill two birds with one stone." In this case, the rat has two wings, so he can kill two birds (pigeons) with one stone (by crashing into them). But, the rat is confused about the value of different birds; he thinks that a statue is worth more than a pigeon, when in reality, a pigeon is worth more than a statue.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the juxtaposition of the rat, who is not a smart creature, with the pigeon, who is. The rat has fake bat wings, which implies that he wanted to be a bat (a smart creature) but wasn't smart enough to actually achieve that goal. The joke is further funny because the rat is trying to negotiate a price for something --- in this case, statues, newly washed cars, and investment portfolio managers --- with the pigeon, who is not interested.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it presupposes a world in which rats are so smart that they can put fake bat wings on and fly, but they are still engaged in rat-like behavior of trying to steal food. The joke also hilariously misunderstands what the pigeon is asking: instead of asking for the values of different items that the rat might steal, the pigeon is asking how much money the rat will get paid for different services.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rat is trying to learn about what he could potentially get for different things he could steal. He is particularly interested in investment portfolio managers, which is an unlikely target for a rat. The joke is a play on the stereotype that rats are attracted to garbage and garbage collectors.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The rat is asking the pigeon to clarify the price list for different types of vermin: rats with wings are worth more than regular rats, and newly washed cars are worth more than carStatues. However, the final item on the list, investment portfolio managers, is don't typically think of themselves as vermin, despite the fact that they may be considered as such by others. The joke is clever because it takes a play on words to make its point.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "statue" can refer to a sculpture of a person or animal, or it can refer to a law that has been enacted. In this case, the rat is asking the pigeon to clarify the value of different items --- a statue, a newly washed car, and an investment portfolio manager. The rat is confusing the word "statue" with "statute", which is a law. The joke is clever because it's a play on words that only makes sense if you know the meaning of both words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that pigeons are often seen as dirty birds. In this case, the pigeon is asking the rat to confirm how much different things are worth in "pigeon currency"; the joke is that the pigeon is valuing things much higher than they are worth in real life, probably because the pigeon is dirty and doesn't have a good understanding of value.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rat is asking the pigeon for clarification on what things are worth in relation to pest control. The rat has just been assigned to pest control and is asking the pigeon for help because he is clearly not familiar with the pricing structure. The joke is clever because it plays on the common stereotype that rats are dirty and often found in places like sewers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The rat with fake bat wings is actually a statue of a rat with fake bat wings. The joke is that the rat is confused as to what the statue is worth, which is a play on the phrase "to beat a dead horse." The phrase "to beat a dead horse" means to continue doing something even though it is no longer effective, or to try to get something that is not worth the effort. In this case, the rat is trying to get the statue, which is not worth the effort because it is just a statue.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rat is asking the pigeon to clarify the prices for various things that can be stolen. The rat is trying to fly so that it can steal things, but it doesn't know how to price them. The pigeon is telling the rat that investment portfolio managers are worth more than cars or statues, which is a play on the fact that pigeons are often considered to be pests, i.e., not worth very much.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rat is offering to fly the pigeon around the city in exchange for food. The rat is asking for an absurdly high price for something that isn't very valuable (flying a pigeon around the city), which is funny because it's a reversal of the usual power dynamic, where pigeons are considered a nuisance and rats are pests.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The rat is asking the pigeon to help him fly by dropping him off the edge of the building, but the rat is confusing the word "drop" with the word "swoop." In other words, the rat is asking the pigeon to kill him. The pigeon, understanding the true meaning of the rat's request, looks alarmed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rat is asking the pigeon for clarification on the prices of common items that pigeons would know. The25. This joke is funny because it is a play on words. The first meaning is that the rat is asking how much a newly washed car is worth in terms of money. The second meaning is that the rat is asking how much a newly washed car is worth in terms of food.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="97.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="99.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
