The phrase "open the superglue" is a common idiom meaning to start a fight. In this case, the idiom is literalized: the dogs got into a fight and their head cones got stuck together with superglue.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the way that the dogs are touching each other. They appear to be trying to mate, but because they have cones on their heads, they cannot actually mate. The cones are usually used to keep dogs from licking their wounds, so the joke is that the dogs are so desperate to mate that they are willing to overlook their injuries.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the dogs got themselves into this predicament by playing with a tube of superglue and getting it stuck to their heads. It's also funny because it's a play on the phrase "like two dogs with a bone", which is often used to describe people who are fighting over something. In this case, the two dogs are actually fighting over a bone (or at least, they were before they got stuck together).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The dog is saying that the other dog (or possibly a cat) must have put the cones on their heads, and implies that it must have taken some effort to do so --- presumably because superglue was involved.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between how dogs and cats are typically portrayed. Dogs are often portrayed as loyal and friendly, while cats are often portrayed as aloof and independent. In this situation, the two dogs are acting more like cats, with their heads hidden in their cones and not really interacting with each other. The joke is that the person who put the cones on the dogs assumed that the dogs would be more like cats and not be able to remove the cones, but dogs are actually much more dexterous than cats and are able to remove the cones easily.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the reader/viewer might initially think that the dogs got their heads stuck together because they were trying to lick each other's cones (like ice cream), but then the punchline reveals that the cat actually glued their heads together. This is a silly image because it's not clear how the cat would've gotten the dogs to hold still long enough to glue their heads together.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two dogs have been attached together by their cone collars, which is not how they are supposed to be used. The joke is also a play on the common saying "curiosity killed the cat". In this case, the "cat" is the person who put the superglue on the cone collars, and the "curiosity" is the dogs' curiosity about how the other dog's cone collar works.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because cats are often thought of as dextrous animals that can open things with their paws (like a can of tuna). In this case, the cat has opened a superglue bottle and glued the two dogs' cone collars together, leaving them attached at the head.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two dogs have their cone collars conjoined, making it look like they have two heads. This is made even funnier by the fact that the cat has opened the superglue, which implies that the cat is smarter than the dogs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cone collars are usually put on dogs (and cats) to prevent them from scratching or licking a wound. However, in this situation, the two dogs have managed to put their cone collars together, which would be very difficult (if not impossible) to do if they were actually trying to avoid each other. The joke implies that the "cat" in question is actually responsible for the dogs' predicament.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The "cat" in this case is referring to the collar, which is also known as a "cone of shame." The joke is that the dogs are so embarrassed by their cones that they are trying to hide their heads from each other.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully puts the blame of the situation on the cat. It's implied that the cat opened the superglue and put it on the dogs' cones, resulting in them being stuck together.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dogs have found a way to open the superglue, which is supposed to be a difficult thing for dogs to do, by using their cones to touch and open the superglue.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cone collars are meant to keep dogs from licking/biting their wounds. However, in this case, the dog's have managed to combine their cone collars together, making it look like their heads are attached. This is probably due to the fact that they were able to open the superglue that was holding the collars together.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because combining two cone collars together is something that would normally be impossible, or at least very difficult. The fact that the dogs have managed to do it shows that they are very clever --- in contrast to the cat, who is often portrayed as being not very bright.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="97.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="99.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
