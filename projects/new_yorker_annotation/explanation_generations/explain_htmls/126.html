"Pursuing other interests" is usually a euphemism for being fired, or for quitting. However, in this context, the man is literally pursuing other interests, in the form of stacking cats on top of each other. This is not something that most people would consider a viable career option, which makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's reaction to seeing the cats stacked on top of each other is to act like it's no big deal, as if it's something he sees all the time. This is a play on the phrase "pursue other interests", which is often used to explain why someone has left a job. In this case, the man has not left his job, but his coworkers have all been laid off, hence the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is talking on the phone about being laid off from his job, but the viewer can see that he is actually not employed. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the man says he was "laid off" but what he really means is that he was "laid down" (i.e. he quit his job). The fact that he is talking on the phone about being unemployed while being surrounded by cats is also funny.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="125.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="127.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
