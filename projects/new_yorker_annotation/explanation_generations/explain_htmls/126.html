The phrase "body parts" could refer to literal body parts, like organs, that can be donated to science or to other people in need. However, the phrase could also refer to body parts that are considered to be attractive, like heads. In the context of heaven, the joke is funny because the headless angel is presumably there because they donated their head while they were alive, and it backfired on them in the afterlife.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the donor program, in which people can donate their organs to be used by other people after they die. The headless angel is a donor who gave his head to someone else. The joke is funnier if you imagine that the headless angel is actually the recipient of a donor head, because it would be a case of someone receiving a head that is not their own.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the headless angel is a donor; presumably, he or she donated their head to another angel who needed it. The joke is clever because it uses the fact that angels are often depicted with wings to make a pun on the phrase "giving somebody a hand."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it contrasts the angelic, otherworldly nature of the setting with the crude reality of a headless angel. It's also funny because it's a play on words: the angel is missing his head, so he cannot "think twice" about anything.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the angel without a head is a reference to the Irish mythological creature known as a Dullahan, who is a headless horseman. The joke is implying that the angel may have donated his head to someone, and that he may now regret that decision.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who is missing their head is an angel, and usually angels are associated with religious iconography like halos and being messengers from God. In contrast, this angel is headless, which is often considered to be a sign of a demon or evil spirit. The joke is emphasizing how donating body parts can have unforeseen consequences, like becoming an angel without a head.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The first part of the joke is about how the angel is missing its head, which is a body part. The second part of the joke is about how people usually donate their body parts to others when they die, but in this case, the angel's body part was taken without consent. The joke is clever because it is both a play on words and a play on the idea of donating body parts.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The angel in heaven is headless because he donated his body parts to science, specifically his head. The joke is clever because it makes you think about the phrase "donating body parts" in a new way --- instead of simply giving blood or organs, you could also donate your entire body.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, although the angel is missing his head, he still has a halo. This halo presumably means that he was a virtuous person when he was alive, and that he did good deeds like donating his body parts. But, the fact that he's now headless in heaven makes it seem like maybe donating body parts isn't such a good idea after all.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the angel's head is missing, and the angel is in heaven. One would expect that in heaven, all angels would have their heads. However, this angel is missing his head, which is a donor organ. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the saying "think twice" is usually used to mean "be careful" or "think before you act". In this case, the angel is telling the other angels to be careful about donating their body parts, because they might end up in heaven without a head.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "giving someone your head." It's also a reference to the fact that many people donate their organs after they die, which is a selfless act. However, the angel in this situation doesn't have a head, which is a vital organ, so the joke is that he may have Regretted his decision to donate his head.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the angel without a head is in a place where they don't need a head, since they are in heaven. This is a play on the phrase "to think twice," which means to consider something carefully before making a decision. In this case, the decision being considered is whether or not to donate body parts, and the joke is saying that if you donate your body parts, you might end up in heaven without a head.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that when people die and go to heaven, they are often thought of as being "complete" --- whole and perfect. However, the fact that this angel is Missing his head is a physical representation of the fact that he is incomplete, and it's a reminder that even in heaven, there are still some parts that are missing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The headless angel is missing his head, which is a body part. The joke is saying that if you donate your body parts, you might end up like the headless angel, without a head. So, it's a warning to not donate your body parts.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the fact that the angel without a head is a Dullahan, which is a type of Irish folklore creature. The Dullahan is a headless creature that rides around on a horse and often carries its own head under its arm. The joke is saying that if you ever see a headless creature, it might be a Dullahan, and you might not want to donate your body parts to them.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="125.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="127.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
