The bear is very large and could easily eat the fish, but is instead recommending the fish to eat. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the stereotype that bears like to eat fish.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The person recommending the trout is actually the bear, which is a predator of salmon. The joke is clever because it uses the fact that salmon are a type of fish to make a pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is unlikely that a bear would be able to eat salmon given that they live in different habitats. Salmon are typically found in rivers and oceans, while bears are found in forests and woods. However, in this scene, the salmon are talking to the bear, which implies that they know he is looking for something to eat, and they are trying to help him out by suggesting the trout, which are found in freshwater streams like the one they are currently in.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idiom "there's more than one way to skin a cat." The idiom means that there are multiple ways to accomplish a task, but the joke implies that there are multiple ways to eat a salmon. This is a play on words because "trout" is another type of fish, and thus there's another way to eat a salmon (by eating a trout).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the absurdity of the situation: the bear is in the waterfall, and the salmon are talking to him. It's strange that the salmon would be talking to the bear, and it's even stranger that the bear would be considering their suggestion of what type of fish to eat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that salmon are a common type of fish that people eat. The joke suggests that the bear is suggesting that the salmon try a different type of fish, because he is about to eat them. This is clever because it's a pun on the fact that the bear is literally suggesting that the salmon try a different type of fish.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bear is asking the fish for dining recommendations. It is unusual because it is typically the other way around: animals eat fish, and fish do not eat animals. The fact that the bear is asking for the fish's opinion on what to eat suggests a level of sophistication and intelligent conversation that is not typically associated with animals, let alone a bear.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes light of a dangerous and life-threatening situation. The bear is clearly hunting the salmon, but the speaker nonchalantly recommends the trout as an alternative, as if the salmon can simply choose to order something else off the menu. This is humorous because it minimizes the gravity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the salmon are trying to sell the bear a fish that is smaller and less valuable than they are. The joke is a play on the fact that salmon are often sold as "trout", which is a type of fish that is less valuable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it is not uncommon for animals to talk to each other in cartoons, it is unusual for the bear to be in the waterfall and for the salmon to be talking to him. In this context, the salmon's suggestion of the trout as an alternative to the bear is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "trout" can mean both a type of fish, and a type of silly, gullible person. In this joke, the salmon are trying to trick the bear into thinking that the trout are a better option to eat than the salmon. But, the bear is not fooled, and he knows that they are just trying to save themselves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The salmon are swimming upstream but they are being hunted by a grizzly bear. The bear recommend the salmon try trout instead, which is a fish that is found in freshwater. This is a pun because trout is also a type of seafood.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The recommended dish is not the traditional "fruit of the sea", but rather the fish that is commonly found in freshwater streams like the one the bear is standing in. This play on words is humorous because it is unexpected and changes the standard phrase in a clever way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common phrase "may I recommend the steak?" which is typically said by a waiter to a customer at a restaurant. Here, the waiter is a bear, and the customer is a salmon, and the joke is that the salmon is about to be eaten by the bear.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the salmon are trying to be helpful to the bear by recommending a different fish to eat, since they are clearly not going to be eaten themselves. The contrast between the salmon's helpfulness and their impending death makes the joke darkly humorous.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="24.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="26.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
