The couple met each other while they were both attending an opera, but the word "opera" can also mean "a dramatic work in which the characters sing all or most of the dialogue." In other words, the couple met while they were both attending a drama in which all the dialogue is sung. This is a clever way to describe a couple that met while attending a wedding, which is itself a kind of opera.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the stereotype that people who go to the opera are pretentious and elitist. In this case, the two people who met at the opera are dressed like Vikings, which further emphasizes the idea that they are out of touch with reality.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people getting married are dressed like Vikings. This contrasts with the typical opera-goer, who is generally upper-class and not dressed like a Viking. The joke suggests that the two people getting married are not upper-class or well-educated, which is surprising given that they met at the opera.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common meeting story of how a couple "met at the opera." In this case, the couple didn't actually meet at the opera, but one of the grooms is dressed as a Viking, which is a common operatic character. This play on words is clever and unexpected, making the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people getting married are dressed like Vikings. This is a play on the stereotype that people who go to the opera are upper-class and sophisticated. The idea of two people dressed like Vikings going to the opera is funny because it's incongruous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it would be very unexpected for two vikings, who are often associated with pillaging and conquest, to meet at the opera, which is a highbrow activity often associated with sophistication and culture. The humor comes from the contrast between the two groups: vikings are often brutish and uncultured, while opera-goers are often seen as being the opposite.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that two of the people getting married are wearing Viking costumes. The opera is a highbrow activity, juxtaposed against the lowbrow activity of pillaging and raiding that is typically associated with Vikings. This joke would be funnier if the people getting married were actually opera singers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is dressed in Viking costumes, which implies that they are interested in Viking culture. However, the joke is clever because the opera is actually a type of Viking entertainment, which means that the couple actually DID meet at the opera. This type of wordplay is called a pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the traditional meeting place for weddings is an opera, where people often dress up in nice clothes. However, in this case, the people getting married are dressed up in armor and carrying weapons, which is not what one typically sees at an opera. The joke is that they are so out of place that they must have met each other at the opera, which is the only place where their outfits would make sense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The opera is a type of theater, so the joke is that the two Vikings met while attending a play. But the word "opera" can also mean a type of classical music, so the joke could also be interpreted to mean that the two Vikings met while listening to music. The ambiguity is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in contrast to the setting of the wedding, which is unusual, the meeting of the couple is quite mundane. The couple met at the opera, which is a specific type of theater, and not a particularly interesting or unique place to meet someone. The joke is funny because it's a contrast of the mundane and the unusual.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that people often meet their romantic partners at "the opera" meaning a dating app or website. In this case, the couple actually met at a real opera, but they are dressed like Vikings, which is a unusual and comical contrast.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "they met in a bar." The fact that the couple met at the opera is strange, because it would imply that they share a love of classical music. However, the fact that they are dressed as Vikings suggests that they are not actually classical music fans, but are just attending the opera in costume. This mismatch is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because operas are typically very highbrow and-civilized events, whereas a Viking wedding would be the opposite. The joke is clever because it makes a pun on the word "opera" (a type of theater) and "opera" (a type of music).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idea that people who meet at the opera are pretentious and high-brow. The joke imagines a situation where people who are actually pretentious and high-brow, Vikings, would meet at the opera. This is silly because Vikings are not known for their love of opera.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="51.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="53.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
