The phrase "I wake up at this point" is often used to describe how someone is feeling when they are groggy/tired and they want to keep sleeping. However, in this context, the phrase takes on a new meaning: the person is literally inside a whale and they have just reached the point in the whale's digestive system where they are about to be regurgitated. The contrast between the two meanings is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "wake up" can mean to become conscious again after falling asleep, but it can also mean to become aware of something. In this context, the joke is about the second meaning of "wake up," in the sense that the person who said it is only now becoming aware of the fact that they are inside a whale. The fact that they are cook, as evidenced by their hats and aprons, makes the joke even funnier, because it suggests that they were so focused on their work that they didn't even notice they were inside a whale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The chef is cooking inside the whale, and he says that he usually wakes up at this point, meaning that he's used to waking up early to cook. However, the fact that he's inside the whale's digestive system implies that he's actually just been eaten, and is about to be digested. The fact that he's still alive and conscious at this point is also surprising and humorous.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="51.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="53.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
