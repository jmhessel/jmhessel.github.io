The joke suggests that the radiator is actually meant for another purpose: to generate heat in case hell ever freezes over. This is funny because it's a highly unlikely scenario.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while organs are typically found in churches, they are usually significantly smaller than the one depicted here. The large size of the organ implies that it's only for very special occasions, such as "when hell freezes over" - an event that is highly unlikely to ever occur.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the radiator fins are usually meant to heat up a room (by circulating hot water or steam), but in this case, they are in a church, which is associated with cold (e.g., "cold feet"). The joke is that the fins are for when "hell freezes over", which is another way of saying "never".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the organ is so big that it seems like it would be more fitting for a much larger space, such as a cathedral. The joke is playfully mocking the organ's size by saying that it's only useful when an absurd event, like hell freezing over, actually happens.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the radiator is so out of place in the church. The joke implies that the woman playing the organ is so bad that the radiator is there to cool down hell when she finishes playing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the typical use of a radiator is to generate heat, and the thought of a radiator in Hell is amusing because it would be used to freezes over the place. However, the radiator in this scene is inside a church, so it's likely that it is being used to generate heat for the churchgoers, which is the opposite of what one would expect.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the radiator is so big that it seems out of proportion for the room, and the priest's comment implies that the radiator is there for a specific purpose: to heat up the room when hell freezes over. This is ironic because usually, people say "When hell freezes over" to describe something that will never happen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the organ is so large and impractical that it could only be used in an improbable scenario, such as when hell freezes over. The joke is clever because it is both a pun (on the idea of a church choir singing "When the Saints Come Marching In" when hell freezes over) and a play on words (on the phrase "It's not for when X happens, it's for when Y happens").</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually when something is said to be "for when hell freezes over," it means that it will never happen. In this case, the radiator is actually for when hell freezes over, because it's in a church. The joke is poking fun at the absurdity of the idea that hell could ever freeze over.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "when hell freezes over" is often used to describe situations that will never happen. In this case, the phrase is literal: the radiator fins are actually for when hell freezes over, i.e., the radiator is used to heat the church when it gets cold.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the radiator is so big that it couldn't possibly be used for anything else other than when hell freezes over. This is a humorous way of saying that the radiator is excessive and unnecessary.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because theRadiatord is so big that it could potentially be used to heat up a large area, like hell. However, the idea of hell freezing over is usually used to describe an event that will never happen. The joke cleverly combines these two concepts to create a humorous visual.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the radiator is so out of place in the church. It's so big that it seems like it would be more appropriate for Hell, which is symbolically cold/hot. The joke is also a play on the phrase "when Hell freezes over," meaning never.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually when someone says "when hell freezes over," they are saying it will never happen. In this case, the priest has a very literal interpretation of the phrase, and has installed a radiator in preparation for when hell actually does freeze over.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because radiators are used to produce heat, and so it doesn't make sense to have a radiator in a place like hell, which is already incredibly hot. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the phrase "when pigs fly", which is used to describe something that will never happen. In this case, the never-happening event is not hell freezing over, but rather, the radiator being used for its intended purpose.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="51.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="53.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
