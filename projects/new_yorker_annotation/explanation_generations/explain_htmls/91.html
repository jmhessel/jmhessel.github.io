The therapist is trying to help the "patient" by reporting the bruises (which were probably caused by someone slipping on the peel), but the bananas can't do anything about it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is treating the banana peel as if it is a patient with bruises. The bruises are probably from the banana being peeled, but the therapist is interpreting them as signs of abuse. The joke is a play on the fact that therapists are required to report any signs of abuse to the authorities.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bruises on the banana are, of course, from where it has been peeled. Bananas are often eaten in psychiatric hospitals as a part of a balanced diet, so the joke is that the psychiatrist is mistaking the bruises on the banana for bruises on a patient.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the banana peel on the couch looks like a person who has been beaten up, and the psychiatrist is required to report any cases of abuse that she is aware of. However, since the banana peel is not actually a person, there is no abuse taking place, making the whole situation absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because bruises are usually caused by physical abuse, and the therapist is required to report cases of suspected abuse to the authorities. However, in this case, the bruises are on the banana peel, which means that they were likely caused by the banana being peeled. Thus, the therapist is required to report the peeler to the authorities.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the therapist's duty to report any suspicious bruises on her patients. In this case, the therapist is seeing a banana peel, which has bruises on it from being peeled, and she is required to report them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The bruises refer to the bananas that have been bruised, which is to say, those that have been damaged. However, in this context, the word "bruises" also refers to injures that one sustains, which would be of concern to a therapist. The therapist in this situation is required to report any suspicious injuries, but because the banana peel has no feelings, there is no need to worry about reporting the bruises.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's absurd to think that a banana peel could be a patient in therapy. It's even funnier because the therapist is saying that she's required to report bruises, which implies that the banana peel has been abused, possibly by the person who brought it into the office.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Bruises" can refer to both physical marks on the body and emotional damage. In this instance, the therapist is required to report emotional damage, but because the banana peel cannot feel emotions, the therapist is instead referring to the physical bruises on the banana peel.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The therapist is required to report bruises because they could be a sign of abuse, but in this case, the bruises are on the banana peel. The banana peel cannot be abused because it is not a living thing, so the therapist's comment is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is treating the banana peel like it's a real patient. The bruising on the banana peel is most likely from when it was peeled, but the therapist interprets it as signs of abuse and is required to report it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is bound by law to report any bruises she sees on her patients --- but the banana peel, being an inanimate object, cannot have bruises. This highlights the absurdity of the situation: the therapist is treating the banana peel as if it were a human patient.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The bruises are on the banana, not on a person, but the psychiatrist is saying that she is required to report them. This is silly because bruises are usually not something that requires reporting, unless they are the result of abuse. But, since the banana peel is not a person, there is no need to report the bruises.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is treating the banana peel as if it is a person, and she is required to report any signs of abuse. However, the banana peel has no emotions and cannot be hurt, so the only abused person in the room is the therapist herself, who is being taken advantage of by the banana peel.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because bruises are usually the result of physical trauma, but in this case, the bruises are on the banana peel, not a human. The therapist is required to report bruises because they could be indicative of abuse, but in this case, the banana peel clearly hasn't been abused.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="90.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="92.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
