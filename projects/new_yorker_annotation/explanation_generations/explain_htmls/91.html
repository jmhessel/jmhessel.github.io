But of course, in reality, they are both just sitting on chess pieces in the middle of the desert with no actual game going on. The joke is a play on the idea that cowboys are supposed to be tough and stoic, but in this situation, they are behaving in a very silly way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that in chess, the knight piece can move in an "L" shape. Thus, the person who is playing the knight can tell the other person to back up and move to the side, as if he is controlling the other person's moves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a typical cowboy standoff, but with two cowboys on chess pieces instead of horses. The joke is made even funnier by the suggestion to slowly back up two paces, which would be very difficult (if not impossible) to do on a horse, but is relatively easy to do on a chess piece.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the parody western movie "A Fistful of Dollars", in which a character has to back away from a ticking time bomb. In this case, the chess pieces are the time bomb, and the cowboys are in danger of being blown up if they don't get away from them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the cowboy trope of a showdown at high noon. In a typical showdown, two cowboys would stand facing each other, ready to draw their guns. However, in this case, because they are on giant chess pieces, the only way to back up or take a step to the side would be to slowly hop or crawl off of their pieces. This makes the whole scenario much less serious and more comical.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cowboy is employing standard chess strategy in order to defeat his opponent. However, in this case, the chess pieces are actual people, so the cowboy's advice, while good chess advice, is ridiculous in the context of two people on horses.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In chess, when a player puts their opponent in "check", it means that the player's king is in danger of being captured on the next turn. So, the cowboy is telling his opponent that he's in danger, and he needs to back up and take a step to the side to get out of harms way ... but of course, since they're both sitting on giant chess pieces, the only way to actually do that would be to physically back up and move to the side, rather than just moving their piece like in a game of chess.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the cowboys is trying to be helpful by giving the other cowboy some tactical advice on how to avoid being in checkmate. However, he does this by using chess metaphors, which doesn't make sense in the context of a real-life situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the chess piece that the cowboy is riding is a king, which means that he is suggesting that the other cowboy moves away so that he can take him in a game of chess. But in the context of the Wild West, the suggestion to back up and take a step to the side is probably a warning that the other cowboy is about to draw his gun on him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The cowboy is telling the other cowboy to move away from him, but he's also telling him to make a move in the game of chess. The word "pace" can mean either a unit of length or a slow, measured step (usually referring to walking).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idiom "I suggest you take a step back." In this case, the speaker isn't suggesting that the other person back up for personal space, but rather, that they back up so they won't get hit by the chess piece the speaker is riding.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that in chess, the knight is the only piece that can jump over other pieces. So, the cowboy is telling the other cowboy to back up and move to the side so that he can "jump" over him like a knight in chess.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. If you are in "check" in chess, it means that your king is in danger of being captured by the other player's pieces. However, if you are in "checkmate," it means that the game is over, and you have lost. In this joke, the cowboy is telling the other cowboy to back up two places and take one step to the side, which would get him out of "check," but the other cowboy is actually in "checkmate," and so backing up and moving to the side won't help him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The cowboy is telling the other cowboy that he should back up and take a step to the side, which is good advice if you're in a gunfight. But he's also telling the other cowboy that he should back up two paces and take a step to the side, which is the best way to avoid getting checkmated in chess.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a way of telling someone in a very roundabout way to leave you alone. The man is telling the other cowboy that if he wants to stay alive, he should essentially get off of his chess piece and back away.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="90.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="92.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
