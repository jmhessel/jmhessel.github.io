The scientist is saying that the most important thing he learned from the experiment is not the data he collected, but rather, he learned something about himself. This is funny because it's a common saying that when you work with animals, you learn more about yourself. In this case, the scientist has taken the saying literally and is saying that he learned he is like a rat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the scientist is clearly not a rat, despite being dressed like one. The joke is clever because the scientist is talking about a study that he did on himself, which would usually be considered unprofessional. However, since he's dressed as a rat, the study that he's talking about is probably a study on rats, which he conducted while he was wearing the rat costume.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "rat" can mean both a type of rodent, and a person who is disloyal or someone who betrays others. In this context, the fact that the scientist is wearing a rat costume is a pun on the fact that he's a "rat" in the sense of being disloyal.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="90.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="92.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
