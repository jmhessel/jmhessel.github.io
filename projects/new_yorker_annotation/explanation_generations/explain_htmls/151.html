In this case, the beaver is saying that he can't tell the other beaver how he's keeping the tree suspended in the air, because if he did, it would no longer be magic. This is a clever way of saying that he doesn't know how he did it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. When the beaver says "it wouldn't be magic," he is referring to the fact that if he told the other beaver how he was able to cut the tree down without it falling, the other beaver would understand the science/mechanics behind it and it would no longer be considered magic. However, the joke can also be interpreted to mean that the first beaver is using magic to cut down the tree, which is why he won't explain how he's doing it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the beaver who is leaving implies that he has some sort of magical power that is allowing the tree to stay up, despite being cut through. If he told the other beaver how he was doing it, then it wouldn't be magic anymore. The joke is clever because, of course, the reason the tree is staying up is because beavers are real animals with special abilities, not magical creatures.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The beaver says that if he tells how he cut the tree, it "wouldn't be magic," when what he really means is that it would be magic if he cut the tree. The joke is clever because it is a beaver talking, so it is expected that he would use words in a literal way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The beaver is saying that if he explained how he cut the tree (by gnawing at it), it would take away the 'magic' of how he did it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the beaver is implying that he has some sort of magical power that allows him to cut down trees without them falling, which goes against what we know to be true about how trees behave. The other beaver's reaction of simply ignoring what is happening also adds to the humor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the beaver is doing something that appears to be magic --- he's managed to cut down a tree without the tree falling. When asked how he did it, the beaver implies that it's because of magic, and if he told the other beaver how he did it, it would no longer be magic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the beaver who is leaving is saying that if he told the other beaver how he managed to cut the tree without it falling, it would take away the magic of the feat. The joke implies that the beaver cut the tree in a way that shouldn't be possible, making it appear like magic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the beaver is doing something that is clearly not possible: cutting a tree down to the middle but having it not fall. When the other beaver asks how he did it, the first beaver says that if he told him, it would ruin the magic. This is a clever way of saying "I don't know," while also maintaining the facade that the beaver is actually performing a magical feat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The beaver is telling the other beaver that if he told him how he cut down the tree without it falling, then it wouldn't be magic anymore. This is a clever way of saying that the beaver won't tell him how he did it because he wants to keep the magic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The beaver says "if I told you how I did it, it wouldn't be magic," but the word "magic" can also refer to the act of felling a tree. In other words, the beaver is saying that he won't tell the other beaver how he did it, because if he did, it would no longer be a mystery or "magical."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words.

The beaver is saying that if he told the other beaver how he was able to cut down the tree without it falling, it wouldn't be a magic trick anymore. This is a clever way of saying that the beaver doesn't want to reveal his secret.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the beaver is hinting that there is some sort of special beaver magic at work that is keeping the tree from falling. Of course, the real explanation is that the beaver has cut the tree at an angle, which gives it more support and prevents it from toppling over.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one beaver is doing something clearly abnormal (chopping down a tree without it falling) and the other beaver is asking him not to spoil the magic by explaining how he's doing it. The joke implies that the first beaver has some kind of magical power, which is absurd given that they are both beavers.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="150.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="152.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
