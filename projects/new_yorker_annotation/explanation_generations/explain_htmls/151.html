Angels are often seen as otherworldly beings who don't need earthly things like bikes. However, the joke cleverly subverts this expectation by having the angels not only need bikes, but also miss things about their earthly life, like Lycra bike shorts. This unexpected juxtaposition is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the angel is talking about how he misses his bike shorts and wife, which are both earthly things. This is unexpected because angels are usually seen as beings who are beyond earthly concerns. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the angel is talking about his "lycra bike shorts" which are a type of tight-fitting shorts, but the word "lycra" can also be pronounced like "licker" which is a slang term for someone who performs oral sex.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the angel is talking about how much he misses his Lycra bike shorts, which are tight-fitting shorts often worn by cyclists. The joke is funny because it's unexpected that an angel would miss something so earthly, and it's also unexpected that he would miss Lycra bike shorts specifically.
