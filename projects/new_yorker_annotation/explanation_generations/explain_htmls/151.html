If the elephant farts, the smell would be so bad that the woman would have to leave. The joke is clever because it simultaneously acknowledges the elephant in the room as a metaphor, while also acknowledging the actual elephant in the room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the phrase "elephant in the room". The elephant in this scene is not just a metaphor for some issue or problem that is being ignored, but a literal elephant. If the elephant were to fart, it would be unbearable for the people in the room, prompting the woman to leave.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the idiom "to fart in someone's general direction." In this case, the person saying the joke is saying that they will leave the room if the elephant farted. This is funny because it's a specific reaction to an implausible situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because even though the elephant is in the room, the man and woman are still choosing to ignore it and act like everything is normal. The joke is clever because it acknowledges the dilemma that the people in the room are in: if they acknowledge the elephant, they will have to deal with the consequences (likely a huge mess), but if they ignore it, they can pretend like everything is fine.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the man's reaction to the elephant. The phrase "elephant in the room" is often used to describe an issue that everyone is aware of but no one wants to talk about. The joke is funny because the man is so keenly aware of the potential for the elephant to fart that he's threatening to leave if it does. This is a way of avoidance coping, which is often used in relation to the phrase "elephant in the room."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idiom "elephant in the room", meaning a big issue that everyone is aware of but nobody wants to talk about. In this case, the big issue is the elephant in the room, literally, and the woman is saying that she will leave if it farts, because the smell would be too much to bear.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idiom "elephant in the room", which refers to a big issue that everyone is ignoring. In this case, the big issue is literally an elephant in the room, which is a source of potential embarrassment for the man, who is sitting next to it. If the elephant farted, it would be incredibly smelly, and the man would probably want to leave the room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "elephant in the room", which refers to a problem or issue that everybody is aware of but nobody wants to talk about.

In this case, the issue that is not being addressed is the fact that there is an elephant in the room, which is a very big and smelly animal.

In this case, the huge elephant in the room is literally an elephant, and its size means that if it farts, the smell will be overwhelming. The joke also suggests that the man is more interested in reading his paper than dealing with the elephant, or even acknowledging its presence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the elephant in the room is a metaphor for something that is obvious but not being addressed. In this case, the huge elephant is literal, and the man is joking that he will leave the room if it farts, because the smell would be overwhelming.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the elephant in the room: it's a metaphor for a big problem that is being ignored. The joke is that the man is saying that if the elephant, which represents the big problem, farts, he will leave, because he can't take the smell. The smell of the elephant's fart is representative of the unpleasantness of the big problem.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a comment on the awkwardness of the situation. The elephant in the room is a metaphor for something that is so obvious and huge that it cannot be ignored, and in this case, the elephant is literally in the room. The woman's comment implies that the elephant's presence is so overwhelming that she would rather leave than stay in the same room as it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the idiom "the elephant in the room", meaning a big, awkward issue that everyone is aware of but nobody wants to talk about. The issue in this particular scenario is that the elephant might fart, and the smell would be unbearable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the huge, looming elephant in the room (which is a metaphor for a big problem that everyone is avoiding) and the small, fart. The joke is clever because it points out that even though the elephant is the big problem, it's the fart that will make the woman leave the room. This is because the fart is a more immediate problem that is easier to deal with than the elephant.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="150.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="152.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
