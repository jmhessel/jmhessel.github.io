I was involved in the original research.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rat man is presumably a research scientist, and so him being involved in the research for the device he's selling makes perfect sense. The joke is made funnier by the fact that the rat man has a rat head, making it even more likely that he would be involved in research regarding rats.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rat man is a doctor, and thus is prescribing a medication for the man. However, the fact that the rat man is a rat raises the question of whether or not he can be trusted. The joke is exacerbated by the fact that the rat man claims to have been involved in the original research for the medication, which raises even more doubts about its efficacy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is shocked that he is being treated by a giant rat. The rat is in denial about his true identity and is trying to pass himself off as a doctor. However, the man is not fooled and knows that the rat is not a real doctor. The joke is clever because it puns on the word "research", which can refer both to scientific research and to the act of looking for information. In this case, the rat is saying that he did both: he looked for information (i.e., he researched), and he was also involved in the original scientific research into the efficacy of the prescription.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's absurd to imagine a giant rat dressed as a doctor. However, the joke is also funny because it's a play on words. The word "research" can mean both scientific research and the act of looking something up. So, the giant rat doctor is saying that he looked up the prescription he's giving, and he also was involved in the original scientific research for the drug.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the rat head is a doctor, and he's prescribing a course of treatment to the other man. The fact that he's a rat man himself suggests that he's aware of the potential side effects of the treatment, which may include becoming a rat man oneself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it subverts the expectation that the person with the medical degree would be the one talking about the research trials. In this case, the man with the rat head is the one claiming to be an expert, even though he's not a doctor. This could be because he's a researcher, or because he's a rat, which are known for being intelligent creatures.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man behind the desk is a rat, and rats are known to spread disease. So, the idea that a rat was involved in the "original research" for a disease is funny because it's likely that the rat was the reason the disease exists in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is a rat, and rats are often associated with filth and disease. Therefore, it's humorous that the rat is prescribing medication to the man, because it's likely that the rat is carrying some sort of disease itself. Furthermore, the rat claims to have been involved in the original research for the medication, which is also funny because it's unlikely that a rat would have the ability to be involved in such research.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the rat head is clearly not a human, and so him being involved in the original research for something implies that he's not as qualified as he's pretending to be.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is absurd. The man looks shocked because he has just been given a prescription by a giant rat dressed as a doctor. The rat explains that he was involved in the original research for the drug, which makes the situation even more absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the rat claims to have been part of the original research for the drug he is prescribing. This is humorous because it's impossible for a rat to be involved in research for a drug meant for humans; rats are not even the same species. The joke is also a play on words, as "involved in research" can also mean "using the drug recreationally."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the stereotype of rats being dirty, sneaky and unhygienic. The rat is dressed as a doctor, which is a profession that is associated with being clean and sterile. The joke is that the rat is not clean or sterile, and is in fact dirty and sneaky. The rat is also playing on the stereotype that rats are involved in research (due to experiments being done on them), and is saying that he was involved in the original research for the drug he is prescribing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The rat doctor is giving the man a prescription for a "cure" that the rat doctor himself was involved in the original research for. The joke implies that the rat doctor is not a real doctor, and the "cure" is not a real cure, because the rat doctor is not a real doctor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the comic incongruity of a rat dressed as a doctor. However, the rat's claim that he was involved in the original research of the drug he is prescribing adds an extra level of absurdity, since rats are not capable of conducting research.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that rats are often used in medical research; in this case, the rat is saying that he was involved in the research for the medication he is prescribing. The man's shock is due to the fact that he is being prescribed medication by a rat, which is an unexpected and potentially dangerous situation.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
