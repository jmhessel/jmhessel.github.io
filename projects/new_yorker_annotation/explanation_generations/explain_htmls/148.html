The "elephant in the room" is a metaphor for something that's obvious but that no one wants to talk about.

The elephant in the room is a metaphor for a big issue that is being ignored. The joke is that even though the man and woman are pretending that the huge elephant in the room doesn't exist, someone still has to take care of it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The idiom "the elephant in the room" is often used to describe a situation where there is an obvious problem that no one wants to talk about. In this case, the problem is that there is an elephant in the room, which is not something that can be ignored. The man is saying that it's the woman's responsibility to deal with the elephant since it's her metaphor, and she should feed it, meaning she should take care of the problem.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common saying "you made your bed, now lie in it." In this case, the man has created a metaphor (the elephant in the room) and the woman is telling him that it's his responsibility to deal with it. However, the joke is also funny because it's a literal elephant in the room and the man would have to deal with feeding it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man reading the paper is pretending not to notice the gigantic elephant in the room, even though it's so large that it's hard to ignore. The woman is trying to get him to engage with the elephant, but he's deflecting responsibility by saying that it's her metaphor and therefore her problem. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words; the word "feed" can mean both to give food to an animal, and to nourish or support an idea.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is trying to ignore the fact that there is a big elephant in their living room, and the man is telling her that it's her "metaphor" and she should deal with it. The joke is clever because "feeding the elephant" is another idiom for dealing with a difficult problem head on.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of the metaphor "elephant in the room", the man is telling the woman that it's her responsibility to deal with the metaphor, since it's her responsibility to feed the actual elephant. The man is saying that it's not his problem to confront or deal with theissue/problem that is being ignored, it's the woman's. The joke is clever because it takes a literal interpretation of the metaphor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "elephant in the room" is often used to describe a massive problem that is being ignored. In this case, the elephant is literally in the room and the man is telling his wife that it is her responsibility to deal with the metaphor, or the problem.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the common idiom "elephant in the room" is usually used to describe a big issue/problem that everyone is ignoring. In this instance, the elephant is an actual elephant, which is even more of a problem because they live in the wild and not in houses. The man is telling the woman that it's her responsibility to care for the elephant because it's her metaphor, and she should have to deal with the consequences of her actions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is sitting in silence, ignoring the fact that there is an elephant in the room, which is a metaphor for a big issue that is being ignored. The joke is that, since it's their metaphor, they should be the ones feeding it, i.e., addressing the issue. But, they are doing the opposite: they are avoiding it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the elephant in the room is a metaphor for something that everyone is thinking about but no one wants to talk about. The joke is that the person is telling the other person to "feed" the elephant, i.e., to bring up the issue that they are both thinking about but not talking about. However, since the elephant is actually in the room, it's a little strange that they are telling the other person to "feed" it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is saying that, since the elephant is the woman's metaphor, it's her responsibility to take care of it. This is funny because it's a way of delegating responsibility for an awkward situation to the person who brought it up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idiom "elephant in the room", which is often used to describe an issue that everyone is aware of but no one wants to talk about.

The phrase "elephant in the room" is often used to describe a difficult topic that people are avoiding discussing. In this case, the man is telling the woman that it's her responsibility to deal with the elephant, because it's her metaphor. However, the woman is literal-minded and hears him saying that she needs to physically feed the elephant, which is not what he meant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "elephant in the room" is often used to describe a situation where there is an obvious problem that no one is talking about. However, in this case, there is an actual elephant in the room, and so the man is telling the woman that since it is her metaphor, she should "feed it". This is funny because it is a non-sequitur: the man is talking about the elephant as if it were a figment of the woman's imagination, when it is clearly not.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="147.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="149.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
