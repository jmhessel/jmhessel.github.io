The woman is talking about how the couple is "sleeping with the fishes," which is a mob phrase meaning that the person has been killed and their body dumped in the ocean. However, the woman correcting the grammar implies that she thinks the couple is simply taking a nap in the ocean with the fishes.

The woman is saying that the couple is wrong to say "sleep with the fishes," because the correct grammar would be "sleep with the fish." However, the woman is actually saying this while the couple is in the process of being killed and their bodies disposed of in cement shoes at the bottom of a river, i.e., they will literally be sleeping with the fishes.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is in a precarious situation (they are tied up with their feet in buckets of cement) and the woman is correcting the grammar of the person who put them there. The woman is acting as if she is not in danger, even though she is in the same situation as the couple. This joke is a play on the phrase "sleep with the fishes," which means to be killed and put in a river or other body of water.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="147.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="149.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
