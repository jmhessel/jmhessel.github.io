However, in this case, with so many clones, any physical description would apply to dozens of people, so the description would be completely pointless.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idea that identical twins are often hard to tell apart. In this situation, there are many identical clones, so the woman on the phone is struggling to describe which one she is looking at. The joke is also funny because it's a comment on the shallowness of our society, where people are often judged based on their looks rather than their personality.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men are clones, so they literally all look the same. The woman on the phone is trying to describe one of the men to the person on the other end, but she can't because they all look exactly the same.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman on the phone is describing the man she is with to someone else, and she has to resort to using physical features that are not unique to him because they are all identical. This would be difficult to do since they are all wearing the same clothes and have the same haircut.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is trying to describe the man she is looking at to the person on the other end of the phone, but because they all look identical, she can't tell them apart. She has to ask for help in order to describe him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, when the woman on the phone is asked to describe the man she is looking for, she is unable to do so because they all look exactly the same. The joke highlights the absurdity of human cloning by imagining a world in which there are so many clones that they become indistinguishable from one another.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the woman's reaction to the clone army. While the clones are an impressive sight, the woman is more concerned with the one man who is not a clone. She is on the phone with someone (potentially the police) and is trying to describe the man who is not a clone. However, because there are so many clones, it becomes difficult to describe the one man who is not a clone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman on the phone is asking for a description of a person, but since all the men in the room are clones of one another, they would all have the same description. The woman is either very confused or the person she's speaking to on the phone is also confused.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman on the phone is trying to describe one of the men to the person she is talking to, but they all look the same so she can't. This is a play on the fact that cloning creates identical copies, so she can't tell who she is looking at.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that, since the clones are identical, there's no way to tell one from the other. The woman on the phone is trying to describe the man she's looking for to the person on the other end, but since all the men in the room fit the description, she can't narrow it down. The joke implies that the cloning technology is so good that even the people who made the clones can't tell them apart.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is on the phone with the police and she is describe the men to the dispatcher. The dispatcher asks her to describe the man and she says they all look the same. The dispatcher does not believe her because it is not possible for everyone to look the same.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman on the phone is asked to describe the man she is with, but she is with a group of men who are all identical. This is difficult because, while she can describe their physical features, she can't tell them apart.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman on the phone is trying to describe the man she is with to someone else, but because they are all clones, she can't tell them apart. To make matters worse, the clones are all leaving the room, so she can't just point one out.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman on the phone is able to describe the man she is seeing to the person on the other end of the line, despite the fact that there are dozens of identical men. This implies that the woman can't tell the men apart, which is odd because they are clones.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="111.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="113.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
