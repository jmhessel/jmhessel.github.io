The joke suggests that it would be better to do the firings in the basement, which is a more private and intimate setting, befitting of the emotional gravity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because firing someone from a job is typically seen as a negative event. The man in the suit is suggesting that instead of having the office on the roof, where people could enjoy the view, they should move it to the basement, where it would be more depressing. This would make firing people even more unpleasant, which is the opposite of what most employers would want.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the idea of firing someone, i.e., terminating their employment, is usually done in a more formal setting, such as an office indoors. Here, the joke is that because the office is on the roof, firing someone would be more dangerous, as they would literally have to be pushed off the roof. The joke is a play on words, as "firing" can mean both terminating someone's employment and shooting a gun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because firing people is usually done in a more discrete way, such as in a closed office or a meeting room. The idea of doing it out in the open on a building rooftop is absurd, and would be quite disruptive to everyone in the vicinity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because firing people is usually an unpleasant experience, and doing it on the rooftop in full view of the other workers in the other buildings seems particularly heartless. The man is suggesting that they do the firings in the basement, out of view of everyone, which would be more humane.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man suggests holding the "firings" (i.e., layoffs or terminations) in the basement, which is usually where the furnace or boiler is located, i.e., where trash is burned. This would be a very symbolic way of terminating employees, by sending them "down the incinerator," so to speak.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person is suggesting that they fire people in the basement, which is usually where people go to get away from things that are happening on the floors above them, like firings. The idea of firings happening in the basement is absurd, and firing people in general is a serious matter, so the joke is dark.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in most cases, when someone is fired from a job, it is considered inhumane to do so in a public setting. The fact that this man is suggesting firing people on the rooftop of a building (where people can see), is darkly humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in most cases, when a business is firing employees, they try to do it in a private and respectful way --- usually not on a rooftop where the employee can be publicly humiliated. The contrast of the typically cold and callous act of firing someone with the unusual setting of doing it on a rooftop makes it funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the serene and beautiful rooftop setting, which is probably where employees would want to spend their time, and the dark and dreary basement, which is probably where they would want to avoid. The joke suggests that the company has to make a choice between firing employees in a pleasant setting or in a more difficult setting, and that they should choose the latter option.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because firing people is usually done in a more private setting, such as a office, and not in a place where the person being fired could jump off the building. The suggestion to do the firings in the basement is a way to keep the person being fired from harming themselves, but it's also a way to make the firing more private, since no one would be able to hear anything from the basement.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Basement" can refer to the lowest level of a building, but it can also be a synonym for "dungeon". The man is suggesting that, instead of firing employees in the rooftop office with a view of all the other buildings, they should do it in the basement so that it would be more hidden and discrete. However, the second meaning of "basement" suggests that the man is also suggesting that firing employees is a dark and terrible act, one that should be hidden away.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is suggesting that, instead of firing people (letting them go from their jobs), they should do the firings in the basement, which would be a more literal meaning of the word. However, the fact that they are on a roof adds an extra layer of meaning to the joke, as "firing" can also mean shooting a gun, which would make more sense to do on a rooftop.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is suggesting that, since they're on the roof, they may as well do the firings (of employees) outdoors. This is silly because people usually don't get fired outdoors, and it would be more disruptive to do so given the noise. Additionally, people could potentially hear the firings from far away, which wouldn't be ideal from a business standpoint.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man at the desk is suggesting that they do the firings, i.e., layoffs, in the basement, which would make more sense as a private place to fire people, rather than out in the open on the roof. The joke is funnier because it's likely that the man at the desk is going to be one of the people who gets fired, and so he is making a suggestion that would save him from being fired in public.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
