The man is literally on a hamster wheel, so he can't just hang up the phone and walk away --- he's got to keep running. The joke is a play on the phrase "I've got to run," which is often used idiomatically to mean that someone has to go or leave.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is literally running, but he is also trying to end the conversation because he is busy. The joke is a play on words because when someone says they "have to run," they usually mean they have to go somewhere quickly, but in this case, the man is already running.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is running on a hamster wheel, which is a common exercise activity for hamsters. The man is presumably running on the wheel to stay in shape or to relieve stress, but it's funny to see a person doing this in an office setting. Additionally, the joke could be interpreted as a pun because the man is literally running and he also has to run to his next meeting.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="182.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="184.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
