I escape to drink.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a clever play on words. The man in the bar is a prisoner who has just escaped from jail, so when he says "I escape to drink," he means that he drinking in order to forget that he's a fugitive from the law. But the joke also suggests that he's an alcoholic, which is why he's in the bar in the first place, hence the double meaning of the phrase.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the prisoner is stating a play on words. Most men go to bars to drink and forget about their problems for a little bit, or "escape" them. The prisoner, however, has actually escaped from prison and is now drinking at the bar. In this way, he is escaping to drink, rather than drinking to escape.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The prisoner is escaped from prison, and he is using the tools to dig his way out. But he is also escaping from his life in general, and he relies on alcohol to help him forget his problems. So, in a way, he is escaping from reality by drinking.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The literal meaning of the joke is that the man is a prisoner who has just escaped from jail, and he's going to the bar to drink. But, the joke also has a second meaning: that the man uses alcohol to escape from his problems. So, the joke cleverly combines both meanings into one.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has just escaped from jail and is now drinking in a bar. He is using alcohol to help him forget his troubles, but his troubles are literally following him since he just escaped from jail. The joke is clever because it playfully inverts the common use of the phrase "to drink to forget."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is saying that he escapes prison to go to the bar to drink, instead of the other way around like most people. Most people drink to escape the reality of their life, but this man escapes prison to drink.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The prisoner is saying that most men go to the bar to drink and forget their problems, whereas he goes to the bar because he's escaped from prison. In other words, drinking is his escape.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the prisoner is literally escaping from prison to go to the bar and drink. He's using the tools he dug up to tunnel his way out. The joke highlights the contrast between the common use of alcohol to forget one's problems and this man's use of it to literally escape his problem (being in prison).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. Most men drink alcohol to forget their problems and "escape" from reality. In contrast, the prisoner is literally escaping from prison, and goes to the bar to drink.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The prisoner is literally trying to escape from prison, but he's also trying to escape from his reality by drinking alcohol. The fact that he's still in the bar, even though he's escaped from prison, shows that he hasn't really escaped from anything.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The prisoner is literally escaping from prison to go drink at the bar, but the phrase "escape to drink" is often used to describe people who turn to alcohol to forget their problems. In this case, the man is turning to alcohol to forget his problem of being in prison.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the prisoner is literally trying to escape from prison. He's using the tools he has to dig a hole in the ground, and he's in the bar to have a drink before he makes his escape. However, the joke also has a second meaning, because many people drink alcohol to escape from their problems. In this sense, the prisoner is trying to escape from his problems by drinking, just like many other people do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The prisoner is technically escaping from prison to drink, but he's also escaping from his reality by drinking. The humor is in the contrast between the two meanings of "escape".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the character has just escaped from prison and is now enjoying a drink at the bar, which is the opposite of what most people would do. Most people would drink to escape the reality of their life, but this character has literally escaped and can now drink without worrying about going back to prison.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The prisoner has escaped from jail, and now he is in a bar, "escaping" from reality by drinking alcohol. But, he is still technically a prisoner, because he is still in jail (the hole in the ground behind him). So, the joke is that he is using alcohol to escape from his current escape.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
