The deer are looking at a deer crossing sign, which is a sign that tells drivers to be aware that deer are crossing the road. The joke is that the deer are confused about the sign because they don't understand that it's telling drivers to be aware of them. However, the joke can also be interpreted as the deer being confused about the sign because they don't understand that it's telling drivers to be aware of the possibility of hitting them with a car, which is a dangerous situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the deer are looking at a "deer crossing" sign, which is a sign that warns drivers to be cautious because deer might walk across the road. However, the deer in this scene are looking at the sign because they are confused about why there is a deer on the sign, since deer don't walk upright. The word "hit" is also used both ways: it can mean to understand something (e.g., "it hits you" = "you understand it"), or it can mean to physically collide with something (e.g., a car hitting a deer). So, the joke is both a play on words and a pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are looking at road signs, which are meant for drivers. The drivers would be looking at the signs and "get it" because they know to stop for deer crossings. However, the deer are just looking at the signs and not understanding them because they don't "get it" in the same way that drivers do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "it hits you." The phrase "it hits you" is often used to describe the moment when someone understands something. In this case, the deer understanding the road signs is a play on the phrase, because the deer are literally being hit by cars when they try to cross the road.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer in the painting are looking at a painting of a deer crossing sign. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the deer in the painting are "crossing" the road in the painting, just as the deer crossing sign is meant to warn drivers to watch out for crossing deer on the road.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are trying to figure out the Traffic signs that are on display in the museum. The fact that they are deer and not people is what makes this joke funny, because deer are not known to be intelligent creatures.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The deer didn't "get" the joke at first, but then they "got" it. The joke is that the deer are looking at road signs that warn of deer crossings, and they are themselves crossing the road.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The deer are looking at "deer signs" which are meant to warn drivers of the animals on the road. However, the deer themselves are interpreting the signs as being about them, as a species. The joke is clever because it is a visual pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are looking at road signs with pictures of deer on them. The joke is that, at first, the deer don't understand why there are deer on the signs --- but then, they realize that the signs are warning drivers to be on the lookout for deer crossings. The joke is clever because it plays on the double meaning of "hit": getting hit by a car, or understanding something.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The deer are looking at a deer crossing sign, which is a sign that tells drivers to be aware that deer are crossing the road. The deer in the picture are literal deer looking at the sign, and they are confused because deer don't walk upright like humans, so they don't understand what the sign means. The joke is that the deer don't get the sign at first, but then it hits them (i.e., they understand).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the three deer in the scene are confused about the deer crossing sign, which is meant for human drivers to be aware of deer on the road. The deer crossing sign is just a silhouette of a deer crossing the road. The joke is that, once you see it, it's Obviousâ„¢ what it is, but that it's easy to miss if you don't know what you're looking for.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the fact that deer sometimes get hit by cars when they cross the road. The deer in the painting are likely roadkill, and the deer admiring the painting don't realize it at first. But then, when they realize what the painting depicts, they realize they could be next if they're not careful.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The deer are looking at road signs, and the signs say "deer crossing." The joke is that the deer didn't understand the meaning of the signs at first, because they are literal deer looking at signs with pictures of deer on them. But then, they realized that the signs were warning them about places where cars frequently hit deer, and the signs were telling them to be careful.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "deer" can mean both the animal and the past tense of the verb "to see." In other words, the deer are looking at the signs, but they are also looking at the signs that say "deer crossing." So, the joke is that they didn't understand the signs at first, but then they realized that the signs were actually for them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because deer are not known for their intelligence, so the fact that they are looking at road signs with a confused expression implies that they don't understand what the signs are saying. However, the deer in the picture are literal deer, so the fact that they don't understand the signs is actually not that surprising. The joke is clever because it pokes fun at both the deer and the viewer for not understanding the signs.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="182.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="184.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
