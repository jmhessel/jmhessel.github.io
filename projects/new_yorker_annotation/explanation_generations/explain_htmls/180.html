The word "endangered" can refer to both the whale, which is a species of animal that is in danger of becoming extinct, and the man, who is in danger of being crushed by the whale. The irony is that the man is more likely to die than the whale is to become extinct.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "endangered" can refer to a species of animal that is in danger of becoming extinct, but it can also refer to a person who is in danger of being harmed or killed. In this case, the man who was crushed by the whale is endangered in both senses of the word.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The term "endangered" usually refers to a species of animal that is in danger of becoming extinct. However, in this situation, the whale is "endangered" because it is in danger of being killed by the people on the island (likely because it has killed a man and crushed a tree).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully mocks the fact that humans often hunt and kill whales for their meat and oil, even though they are an endangered species. In this case, it is the whale that is stranded and in danger, while the humans are safe on the island. This reversal of roles is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. Whales are "endangered" meaning that they are a species that is at risk of becoming extinct. However, the word "endangered" can also mean "in danger," as in, the whale is in danger of dying because it is beached on a small island.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "endangered" can refer to both the state of being at risk of extinction, as well as the state of being in danger. In this case, the whale is both: it is a large mammal that is beached on a small island, far away from its natural habitat in the ocean, and it is also in danger of dying because of its restricted mobility and lack of food and water.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The whale is endangered, meaning that it's a species at risk of becoming extinct. However, the man who was crushed by the whale is also endangered, meaning that he's in danger of being killed. The joke is clever because it's not immediately obvious that it's a play on words, but once it's pointed out, it's funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully mocks the whale's situation. The whale is in an extreme situation because it's a large animal that is beached on a small island; the animal is not in its natural environment and is thus in danger. The joke implies that, while humans typically think of whales as being endangered animals, the tables have turned and now the whale is the one in danger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The whale is beached on an island that is too small for it, and thus it is "endangered." But, the joke is also saying that now that the whale is beached and stuck, it is the one who is in danger, i.e., it is now the endangered species.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "endangered" can mean two things: first, it can refer to species that are in danger of becoming extinct; second, it can refer to being in danger oneself. In this joke, the whale is in danger of becoming extinct (i.e., the first meaning of "endangered"), but it is also in danger itself (i.e., the second meaning of "endangered").</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Endangered" can mean two things: first, that a species is at risk of extinction, and second, that a person is in danger. In this case, the whale, which is an endangered species, is also endangering the man, who is now in danger of being crushed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Endangered" can refer to a species of animal that is in danger of becoming extinct, but it can also refer to being in danger of being harmed oneself. In this case, the man who was crushed by the whale is clearly in danger of being harmed, or even killed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words.
