Ignorance of the law is no defense.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man being pulled over is being given a maths lecture by the police officer, even though the man (likely) doesn't care about the maths behind his speeding ticket. The joke is clever because it is a play on the phrase "ignorance of the law is no defence", which means that you can't argue that you didn't know a law was in place in order to get out of being punished for breaking it. In this case, the man is being given a lecture on the law (i.e. the maths equation), but it's not going to help him get out of his speeding ticket.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police officer is telling the man that he can't use the excuse "I didn't know the speed limit" to get out of getting a ticket. The police officer has written a long and complicated math formula on the chalkboard to show how the man had been speeding, but the officer is telling the man that he won't even listen to his excuses.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man being pulled over is being given a math lesson by the police officer. The math equation is presumably the speed limit, and the man is being told that not knowing the speed limit is not a valid excuse for speeding. However, the joke could also be interpreted to mean that the math equation is too complicated for the man to understand, and he is being told that not understanding the law is not a valid excuse for breaking it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the assumption is that the man being pulled over doesn't know the math equation that the officer is showing him, and is trying to come up with an excuse for his speeding. However, the officer is telling him that even if he didn't know the equation, it wouldn't matter because ignorance of the law is not a valid defense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police officer's response is a common phrase that is used to tell people that they can't use the excuse "I didn't know the law" to get out of a ticket or punishment. However, in this context, the man actually didn't know the law because he couldn't read the chalkboard. The police officer's response is thus ironic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man being pulled over is clearly guilty of speeding, but the officer is using an absurdly complicated mathematical formula to show him how fast he was going, when the man could have just looked at the speedometer himself. The joke implies that even if the man didn't know the law, he should have been able to figure out that he was breaking it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the officer is technically correct that the man was speeding, the way he is enforcing the law is absurd. The man clearly doesn't know the formula the officer is trying to explain to him, making the man's ignorance of the law no defense against the speeding ticket.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man being pulled over doesn't actually know what the formula on the chalkboard is, but the police officer is telling him that it doesn't matter; even if he didn't know he was breaking the law, he is still being ticketed. The joke is clever because it plays on the double-meaning of the word "ignorance": in this context, it can mean both "not knowing something" and "not being aware of something."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in this situation, the officer is using a complicated math formula to show the speeding driver how fast he was going, and the driver is trying to use the excuse that he didn't know the speed limit. However, the officer is quickly shut down with the response that "ignorance of the law is no defense." This is a standard legal principle, but it is used in an unusual context here.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man being pulled over doesn't need to know the specific math equation the police officer is showing him in order to be guilty of speeding. The police officer is telling him that even if he didn't know how fast he was going, he is still breaking the law.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has been pulled over for speeding, and the officer is telling him that the mathematical formula written on the chalkboard is the equation for how fast he was driving. The man protests that he doesn't know math, to which the officer replies "ignorance of the law is no defense." In other words, even if the man doesn't understand the math, he still broke the law by speeding.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man being pulled over is trying to use a math equation to prove to the police officer that he wasn't speeding. However, the police officer is uninterested in the man's excuse and simply tells him that ignorance of the law is no defense. This is a play on the phrase "ignorance of the law is no excuse," which means that people cannot use the excuse of not knowing the law to get out of being punished for breaking it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in this context, the word "ignorance" has a double meaning: first, the man being pulled over was literally ignorant of the law (i.e., he didn't know he was speeding), but second, he is also ignorant in the sense that he is uneducated and doesn't know math. The officer is telling him that it doesn't matter, and he will still be punished for breaking the law.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the officer is telling the man to "save it" --- i.e. don't bother trying to explain himself or argue --- but the man is technically correct in saying that "ignorance of the law is no defense", meaning that if you don't know a law exists, you can't be penalized for breaking it. The officer's response is an acknowledgment of the man's point, but also a way to shut him down.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even if the man didn't know that the speed limit was, say, 55 mph, and he was going 60 mph, he would still be breaking the law. The chalkboard with the long formula is irrelevant, because the man would still be speeding.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
