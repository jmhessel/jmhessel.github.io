In a restaurant, "service" usually refers to the waitstaff bringing food to the table; but in this case, because the customers are cooking their own food, "service" refers to the act of cooking. Thus, the man is saying that, according to the menu, they will have to cook their own food.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the disparity between what the couple in the background is doing (looking at menus) and what the couple in the foreground is doing (cooking their own food). In a normal restaurant scenario, it would be the people in the background who are cooking the food, and thus the joke is cleverly pointing out the incongruity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The couple in the background is reading the menu and sees that "service is not included," meaning that they will have to pay extra for someone to wait on them and bring them their food. The other couple, who are cooking their own food, takes this literally to mean that they will have to serve themselves.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="179.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="181.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
