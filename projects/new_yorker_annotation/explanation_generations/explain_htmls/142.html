The phrase "that startles me every time it happens" can mean two things. First, it can be a response to the situation in which the barber shop customers are startled every time a barber cuts someone's hair and the huge spring on the floor bounces the person's head up, making a loud noise and causing the person to flinch. Second, the phrase can mean that the speaker is startled every time they see the huge hole in the ceiling and the huge spring on the floor, because it is such an unusual sight.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non-sequitur. The hole in the ceiling and the spring on the floor are both unusual, and it's not clear how they are related. The fact that the barber is startled every time the spring goes off implies that this is a regular occurrence, and that the barber is used to the hole in the ceiling and the spring on the floor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non-sequitur. The hole in the ceiling and the spring on the floor are not related to the barber shop in any way, and yet the person getting their hair cut is startled every time they happen. This joke is a play on the fact that non-sequiturs often startle or confuse people.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="141.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="143.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
