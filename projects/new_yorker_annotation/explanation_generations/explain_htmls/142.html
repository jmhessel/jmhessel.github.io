The joke suggests that the person would prefer to be covered in rats instead, which most people would find repulsive. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the phrase "I'm more of a dog person" which is often used to describe people's preferences for pets.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man who is covered in birds is saying that he's more of a "rat person," meaning that he prefers rats to birds, but the phrase can also be interpreted to mean that he's covered in birds like a rat would be covered in fleas.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the two people on the bench: one is covered in pigeons and the other is reading a newspaper. The man reading the newspaper is saying that he prefers rats to pigeons, which is a strange thing to say because pigeons are not typically considered to be pests like rats are.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person on the right, who is covered in pigeons, is being asked if they like birds. The person's response of "I'm more of a rat person" suggests that they do not like birds, which is ironic because they are currently being used as a human perch by several birds.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the two people on the bench: the person on the left is reading a newspaper, which is an activity associated with intelligence and sophistication, while the person on the right is covered in pigeons, which is associated with uncleanliness and being a nuisance. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the phrase "I'm more of a rat person" usually means that someone prefers the company of rats (which are also associated with being dirty and pests) over other people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The person on the right is covered in pigeons, which are often considered to be rats with wings. The person on the left is saying that he prefer rats, which are seen as dirty and disgusting, over pigeons. It's a funny way to reject a person who is trying to talk to you.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man covered in birds is saying that he's more of a "rat person," meaning that he would rather have rats as pets than birds. However, the word "rat" can also mean an unsavory or unpleasant person, so the joke could also be interpreted to mean that the man covered in birds is saying that he would rather have rats as friends than birds.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it contrasts the two animals mentioned: pigeons are commonly considered to be dirty, flea-ridden birds that are a nuisance, while rats are considered to be dangerous, disease-ridden rodents. The person on the right is covered in pigeons, so the joke is that he must be more of a rat person, since he's covered in creatures that are similar to rats.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bird-covered person on the right is clearly not a rat person, as they are covered in pigeons. The joke is also funny because, in contrast to the bird-covered person, the man on the left is reading a newspaper, which is commonly associated with rats (because of the phrase "newspaper rat").</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man covered in birds is saying that he's more of a "rat person," meaning that he prefers rats to birds. However, the way he says it, it sounds like he's saying that he actually is a rat person, as in, he is a human who has transformed into a rat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man on the right is covered in pigeons, and so the man on the left is saying that he is more of a "rat" person instead of a "pigeon" person. This is funny because it is a pun on the words "rat" and "right"; the man on the right is covered in pigeons, and so he is "right" about being a rat person.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man being attacked by birds is presumably covered in bird seed, which is a food that birds like to eat. The fact that the other man is reading implies that he's not really paying attention to what's happening, and is just making a casual observation. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the saying "I'm more of a dog person."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The person covered in pigeons is saying that he is more of a rat person, meaning that he prefers rats to pigeons. However, the word "rat" can also be used to describe a person who is dishonest or disloyal. So, the person covered in pigeons could also be saying that he is more honest and loyal than the other person, who is presumably not covered in pigeons.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man being attacked by birds is being conditioned by them through a process known as imprinting. The man who is not being attacked by birds is saying that he is more of a rat person, which is a reference to the fact that rats are often considered to be disease-carrying pests. The joke is clever because it is using a real-world phenomenon to make a light-hearted comment about personal preferences.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man being attacked by birds is being "pecked" at, which is a verb often used to describe being pestered or annoyed. In contrast, the other man says he's more of a "rat person." This could either mean that he prefers the company of rats over birds, or that he is more likely to be found in places where rats are, like in the garbage. Either way, the joke is clever because it takes a common phrase and gives it a humorous twist.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="141.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="143.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
