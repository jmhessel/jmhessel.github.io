This joke specifically references the fact that the hammock is a discount tent, which makes it even less appropriate for kings to be using. The joke is clever because it's a pun on the phrase, but it's also a commentary on how silly it is for kings to be using a hammock in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people in the hammock are acting like they are in a tent, which is much more humble than a hammock. Winter is typically a time when people use tents, so the joke is playing on the fact that they are using a hammock in winter instead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "the winter of our discontent." In the original phrase, "discontent" refers to the feeling of being unsatisfied. In this joke, "discount" refers to the fact that the kings are poor and have to resort to sleeping in a cheap hammock. This is a clever way of making a joke about how the kings are poor and their situation is dire.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "Now is the winter of our discontent," which is a line from a Shakespeare play. In the play, the line is spoken by a man who is upset because he is not the king, and is planning to overthrow the current king. In the joke, the man is still upset because he is not the king, but he is content because he is in a discount tent (a type of hammock).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully mixes up a well-known line from Shakespeare's "Richard III" ("Now is the winter of our discontent") with a line from a song by the band They Might Be Giants ("Discount tent, ooh ooh ooh"). The joke works because both lines are about things that are wintery and not very desirable (a discontent mood/a cheap tent), but in the context of the hammock, the line from the song sounds like it could be about how happy the two people in the hammock are, despite the winter season.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two kings are in a hammock, which is an unexpected place to find kings. Hammocks are often associated with relaxation and outdoor activities like camping; the joke suggests that the kings are taking a break from their royal duties and enjoying a leisure activity. Additionally, the phrase "winter of our discount tent" is a parody of the famous line "now is the winter of our discontent" from Shakespeare's play Richard III.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The original line from Shakespeare's Richard III is "Now is the winter of our discontent." The joke substitutes "discount tent" for "discontent" to make a pun. In the context of the scene, it's funny because the two royalty people are in a hammock, which is a type of tent, and it's unusual for royalty to be in a hammock.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the well-known opening line of Shakespeare's play "Richard III": "Now is the winter of our discontent." In the play, this line is spoken by the villainous Richard III as he laments his station in life and plots to take over the throne. However, in this joke, the kings are in a hammock, which is a much more relaxed and content setting, befitting of the discount price of the tent. Additionally, the hammock is a symbol of relaxation, while the throne is a symbol of power, so the joke is also making a statement about the power dynamics of the two kings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two kings are lounging in a hammock, which is not a traditionally regal activity. The joke is a play on the line "Now is the winter of our discontent" from Shakespeare's play Richard III. In the play, the line is said by the character Richard III as he laments his situation; in the joke, the kings are content in their hammock, despite the fact that it's winter.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully pokes at the regal setting by replacing a grand object like a throne with a more humble object like a hammock, and furthermore, by replacing the "winter of our discontent" --- a line from Shakespeare's Richard III --- with "discount tent." This humorous comparison makes light of the kings' setting and situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people in the hammock are acting like they are in a tent, which is much less luxurious than a hammock, and are discounting the winter, which is generally not considered to be a time of year when people go camping.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The original quote is "Now is the winter of our discontent," which is from Shakespeare's play Richard III. In the play, the quote is meant to be a metaphor for how the protagonist is feeling. However, in this instance, the quote is literalized to be about a winter camping trip, and the protagonist is feeling discontent because they are not in a proper bed in a warm castle.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two kings are in a hammock, which is typically associated with relaxation and warm weather. However, the quote from Shakespeare's "Richard III" references the winter, which is the opposite of warm weather. This joke contrasts the two concepts to create a funny juxtaposition.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people in the hammock are royalty, and they are using a discount tent instead of a hammock. The word "hammock" is also a homophone for "amok," which makes the joke even funnier because it sounds like they are in a hammock going "amok."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "the winter of our discontent," which is from Shakespeare's Richard III. In that play, the "winter of our discontent" refers to the dark time before the rise of the murderous king. In this joke, the "winter of our discontent" refers to the dark time before the kings got their discount tent.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
