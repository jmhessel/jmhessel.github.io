It's also funny because it's a non-sequitur: the woman isn't responding to the man's suicide attempt directly, but is instead telling him to wait until later to do it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is telling her husband to kill himself, but to do it in a more considerate way so that she doesn't have to see it. This is dark humor because it's a joke about suicide, which is a serious topic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's response to her husband's suicide attempt is nonchalant and callous. She is telling him to come to bed and then kill himself tomorrow, as if it's not a big deal. This is unexpected because most people would be more emotional if they witnessed a loved one attempting suicide.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's reaction is so nonchalant. She's not surprised or scared that her husband has a gun to his head; instead, she's just annoyed that he's doing it in the bedroom and not in the morning. She's also dismissive of his apparent suicide attempt, telling him to just do it in the morning when it won't be as disruptive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is telling her husband to kill himself, but to do it in a way that is more convenient for her. She wants him to come to bed and then kill himself in the morning so that she can get a good night's sleep. The fact that she is so nonchalant about her husband's suicide attempt is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is pointing a gun to his head and the woman says to come kill himself in the morning. This is funny because the woman is telling him to kill himself but in a nonchalant way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a dark play on words. The husband is telling his wife to come to bed, but what he really means is that he wants her to sleep next to him while he kills himself. He's trying to be considerate by not making too much noise and wakes her up, but the reality of the situation is still very tragic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The husband has a gun to his head, which could be interpreted as him being suicidal, and the wife says kill yourself in the morning, which could be interpreted as her telling him to delay his suicide until the morning. However, the fact that there are gun shot holes all around the house suggests that the husband has been firing the gun randomly and not actually trying to kill himself. In that case, the wife's comment is humorous because she is telling him to go ahead and kill himself instead of continuing to fire the gun and put everyone at risk.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the absurdity of the man's request. If the woman just went to bed and waited for the man to kill himself in the morning, she would have to wake up to a dead body, which would be pretty gruesome. Furthermore, it would be more efficient for the man to just kill himself now and save the woman the trouble of having to deal with his body later.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a dark humor joke about suicide. The fact that the man is pointing the gun to his head but hasn't pulled the trigger yet suggests that he hasn't made up his mind about whether or not to kill himself. The wife's response is nonchalant and suggests that she doesn't really care one way or the other.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's wife is telling him to just wait to kill himself until morning, as if suicide is a normal thing to do that can be scheduled into one's day. She is nonchalant about the whole thing, which makes it even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a dark humor take on a serious issue. The woman is telling the man to just go to bed and kill himself in the morning, as if it's an inconvenience to her that he's still alive. The fact that the man has missed his target and there are bullet holes all around the room suggests that he's attempted suicide before, making the joke even darker.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is pointing a gun to his head, as if to kill himself, but his wife tells him to do it in the morning instead. The word "kill" can be used both as a verb meaning to murder someone, and as a phrasal verb meaning to collapse from exhaustion. In this case, the wife is telling the man to exhaust himself by coming to bed instead of killing himself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the wife's response to her husband's suicide attempt is matter-of-fact and nonchalant. She is not emotional or panicked, instead she simply tells him to come to bed and do it in the morning, as if it's an inconvenience to her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's response to the man's clear suicidal state is very nonchalant. She doesn't even try to talk him out of it or get him help, she just tells him to wait until morning to do it. This is unexpected because most people would react with more urgency to such a situation.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
