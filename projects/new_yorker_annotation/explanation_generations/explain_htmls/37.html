The man's nonchalance about the pain he's in is contrasted with the seriousness of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is being stabbed and he's more concerned with customer service than his own personal safety. The knife in his back is a metaphor for how he's been betrayed, and the fact that he's more concerned with the bills than the betrayal is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the man has been stabbed in the back, he is still calm and collected enough to be practical, and so he asks the customer service representative to switch his billing method to online so that he can save some money. This is funny because it's a very normal thing to want to do, even in the midst of a crisis.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who has just been stabbed is more concerned with changing his billing method for the utility company he's on the phone with, than with the fact that he's been stabbed. The joke could be interpreted as a commentary on how someone who is about to die might have their priorities changed, or it could simply be a play on how utility companies are often more difficult to deal with than life-threatening situations.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is talking to customer service about his phone bill, and he's saying that he'd like to start receiving it online. The note stuck in his back changes the context of the conversation: instead of simply wanting the convenience of online billing, the man is now saying that he wants to stop receiving his bill in the mail because he knows that he's going to be stabbed in the back if he continues to get it that way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the man has just been stabbed in the back, he is still thinking about customer service and how he can make his life easier by signing up for online billing. The man's priorities are skewed, which is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has been stabbed and is about to die, but he is still worried about paying his bills on time. He is so worried about it that he wants to change his billing method to make sure that he can still pay his bill even if he dies. This is a satirical commentary on how people are so obsessed with money that they will still think about it even in life-or-death situations.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is being stabbed in the back and he requests to start receiving his bill online. This could be interpreted two ways: first, that despite being in pain, the man is still thinking about trivial things like his bills. Second, that the person who is stabbing him is his phone company, and they are "stabbing" him with their high bills. In either case, the joke is dark humor that makes light of a serious situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man, who has just been stabbed in the back, is talking to customer service about his billing preferences. The contrast between the mundane request and the life-threatening situation makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the man has just been stabbed in the back, he is more concerned with customer service and wanting to change his billing preference for his phone company. The incongruity of his reaction to being stabbed with his mundane request is what makes the joke humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non-sequitur: the billing statement is unrelated to being stabbed in the back. The man's reaction is also unexpected because he is more concerned with how he receives his bill than with the pain he is in. This shows that he is either very brave or very foolish.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man, who has just been stabbed in the back, is more concerned with his phone bill than with the fact that he's been betrayed. This highlights the hypocrisy of many people's complaints about phone bills: they are more concerned with saving a few dollars on their bill than they are about the very real suffering of people who have been betrayed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the seriousness of the situation (the man has been stabbed in the back) and the banality of the request (to have his bills sent online). This contrast is humorous because it's unexpected and absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is so calm about being stabbed in the back that he wants to change his billing method for the telephone service. The word "bill" can also be a verb meaning to charge someone for a service, which could be another meaning of the man's request. Either way, the joke is funny because it is unexpected that the man would be so nonchalant about being stabbed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man, who has just been stabbed in the back, is more concerned with informing the person on the other end of the phone that he'd like to start receiving his bill online. The joke is clever because it's a play on the phrase " stabbing someone in the back," which is often used to describe betrayal.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="36.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="38.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
