I met a man at the pet store.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is talking on the phone and she is telling the person on the other end of the line about the man she met, who just happens to be in the fishbowl next to her. It's a funny way to introduce someone, and it's made even funnier because the man in the fishbowl can hear her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the woman's situation: she is the one who is really on an island, in the sense that she is isolated and cut off from the rest of humanity. The man in the fishbowl may be cut off from the rest of humanity in a physical sense, but he is not as isolated as the woman because he can still interact with other people, even if they are fish.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common saying "you wouldn't believe it if I told you." In this case, the woman has obviously met a man who is very small, possibly a toy or figurine, and yet she is acting as if it's normal to meet a man this way. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the idea of being "stuck in a fishbowl" which is often used to describe a feeling of being trapped or claustrophobic.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="55.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="57.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
