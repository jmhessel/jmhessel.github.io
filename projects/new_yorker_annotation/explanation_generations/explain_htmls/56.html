I'm pregnant.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the pun on the word "blender." A blender is a type of kitchen appliance, but it can also mean to mix two things together. In this case, the man's head has been literally replaced with a blender, so the woman's statement about the rubber seal breaking is a pun on the man's head being a blender.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's reaction implies that the man's head being replaced with a blender is not an abnormal occurrence. This could either mean that the woman is used to the man's head being a blender, or that she is surprised that it's a blender again (implying that this has happened before). Either way, the fact that the woman is pregnant implies that the man's head being a blender is somehow related to the conception of the child, which is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is saying that she's pregnant, and the man's head is a blender, so the joke is that she's saying that the man's head is going to "seal the deal" and make a baby.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's head being replaced by a blender is a very strange and unexpected situation. However, the woman's response is even stranger; instead of being worried or scared, she is calmly telling him about how she got pregnant. The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur; the woman's response doesn't make sense in relation to the man's blender head.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman, who is presumably pregnant, is telling the man, who has a blender for a head, that the pregnancy is his fault. The fact that the man has a blender for a head is strange and unexpected, and the woman's nonchalant reaction to it makes the joke funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's statement implies that the man's head being replaced with a blender is not an unusual occurrence, and she is only surprised because of a previous incident with the blender. This punchline reverses the expected reaction to the blender head, which would be to be shocked and appalled. However, since the woman is merely surprised, it implies that she has seen this happen before, or that it's not as big of a deal as it seems.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's head being replaced with a blender is a visual pun on the phrase "to have one's head in the clouds." The woman's pregnancy announcement is a non sequitur that furthers the confusion. This could be interpreted as the woman telling the man that she is pregnant with his child, or that she is pregnant and the man's head being in the clouds is why he didn't notice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is telling the man that she is pregnant, and the man's response is to ask her about the time when his rubber seal (on the blender) broke. The woman is probably surprised that the man is more concerned about the blender than the news that she is pregnant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's reaction to the man's head being replaced with a blender is a reference to a common kitchen appliance malfunction: when the rubber seal on the blender breaks, it can cause the contents to explode. In this case, the 'contents' is the man's head, and the woman is pregnant with his child. The pregnant woman's reaction is one of surprise, because she didn't expect the man's head to be replaced with a blender, and also because she is pregnant with his child.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is surprised to see that the man's head has been replaced with a blender, and her first reaction is to mention a time when the blender's rubber seal broke. This is a play on words because "breaking the seal" is often used as a euphemism for losing one's virginity. In this case, the woman is implying that she became pregnant after the man's head was replaced with a blender, because the blender's seal was broken.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is revealing that she is pregnant with the man's child, and the man's head has been replaced with a blender. The fact that the blender is a common household appliance makes the situation even more surreal and humorous. The woman's comment about the rubber seal is a reference to the fact that blenders typically have a rubber seal that can break, which can lead to the appliance leaking, and thus, the woman's revelation that she is pregnant is like a leak in the man's life.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "the blender of love." In this case, the phrase is used to mean that the man has gotten the woman pregnant, which is a very serious situation, but the phrase is usually used in a more light-hearted way. The joke is also funny because it's a bit gross to think about a blender being used as a head, and the woman's reaction is probably one of disgust.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur. The woman is speaking to the man as if his head being a blender is a normal thing, and she is just mentioning a casual memory as if it's no big deal. However, the casual memory she brings up is actually a very big deal: the man's rubber seal broke, which means that the woman is now pregnant. The contrast between the casual memory and the seriousness of the consequences creates the humor in the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is saying that she's pregnant, and the man's head being replaced with a blender is a reference to a rubber seal breaking. This is a double meaning, because it can also refer to a condom breaking, which would also lead to pregnancy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is saying that she is pregnant, and the man's head being a blender is a metaphor for how he "broke the rubber seal" on their relationship by having sex with her. This is a double meaning because the man's head being a blender also literalizes the idiom "to break the seal," meaning to urinate, which is often the first thing people do after entering a bar.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="55.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="57.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
