They are taking the recess by going down the slides, which is something that kids would do. The contrast between the serious legal setting and the child-like behavior is what makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "recess" can mean either a break from school or a break in court proceedings. In this situation, the adults are taking a break from school by playing on the playground equipment, while the children look on bemused.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, although adults typically take short breaks (or recesses) at work, they do not usually play on playground equipment meant for children. The joke suggests that the adults in the scene are acting like children by playing on the slide, andImplies that they are perhaps not as competent as they should be.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of a trial, a "recess" is a break that the judge orders in order to give the jury a chance to deliberate. However, in this context, the "recess" is simply a break that the adult is taking to play on the playground slides. The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the adult is taking a "recess" from their normal life to play on the playground slides.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the adults are taking a break from their responsibilities by going down the playground slide, which is something that children would do. The contrast between the adults' behavior and their status as legal professionals is what makes this joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because going down a playground slide is something that children do, not adults. However, in this scene, the adults are going down the slides, which is a surprising reversal of the normal order of things. The joke is made funnier by the addition of the detail that the adults are in work clothes, as if they just came from a court hearing and were ordered by the judge to take a short recess. This would explain why they are in the park and why they are going down the slides.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people in the playground are not actually children, but are adults who are on a break from their work as judges. They are using the playground slides as a way to relax and have fun, which is something that you would normally see children doing rather than adults.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the word "recess." A recess is a break in court proceedings, but it can also refer to a break in general, or a break specifically for children to play. In this case, the judge has called a recess in court proceedings, but the adults are using the opportunity to play on the playground slides, something that would normally only be done by children.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the two meanings of the word "recess": a recess can mean a short break in the proceedings of a court case, but it can also mean a break in the school day for children to play. In this case, the adults are on a break from their court case to play on the playground slides, and the kids are looking at them strangely because they are behaving out of the norm.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the scene of adults going down playground slides is unusual, and the fact that they are doing so during a recess from court suggests that they are there under duress, possibly because the judge ordered them to take a break. The image of grown adults going down slides is unusual and comical.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The people on the playground are adults, so the judge ordered a short recess, rather than the other way around. A recess is a break in proceedings, and the people on the playground are taking a break from their proceedings by playing on the playground slides.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. A recess is a break that is ordered by a judge in order to take a break from proceedings; in this case, the adults are playing on the playground slide and they are using the slide as a way to take a break from the proceedings. The children are watching the adults and they have blank expressions because they don't understand what is happening.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a courtroom, when the judge orders a recess, it is usually a short break for the jury to deliberate or for the lawyers to confer. However, in this playground context, the recess is short because the adults are only going down the slides, which is not a very strenuous activity. The contrast between the two situations (courtroom vs. playground) makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because adults going down playground slides is unexpected and childish, yet the context is completely serious. A recess is a break in proceedings, usually in a courtroom, and the fact that the judge has ordered a recess suggests that the adults are engaging in this child's play in a very legal setting. The joke would be funnier if the people going down the slides were actually lawyers or defendants in a trial, for example.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in a courtroom, a recess is a break in the proceedings where people can stand up, stretch, and take a break from the formal proceedings. However, in this playground setting, the adults are taking a break from their work by playing on the playground equipment meant for children. This is silly because adults don't usually play on playground equipment.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
