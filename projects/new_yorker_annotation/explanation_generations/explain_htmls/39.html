The joke is clever because it uses the word "said" in two different ways: the first time, it refers to the act of saying something, and the second time, it refers to the manner in which something is said. This play on words is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has been stabbed in the back and is more concerned with the tone of voice his wife used than the fact that she just stabbed him. This is a dark joke because it's implying that the man would rather be stabbed than listen to his wife's nagging, which says a lot about their relationship.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has been stabbed in the back, which is typically seen as a very betrayal. The woman he was speaking to on the phone must have said something that led him to believe she was betraying him, which caused him to get stabbed. The joke is clever because it uses the double meaning of "backstabbing": both literally being stabbed in the back, and being betrayed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has been stabbed in the back, and yet he is still more concerned about the tone of the person he was speaking to on the phone than the fact that he has been stabbed. This shows that he values his relationships more than his own physical safety, which is an ironic twist on the expected reaction to being stabbed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the guy who got stabbed is more worried about the way his girlfriend said she was breaking up with him than the fact that he got stabbed. The fact that he's more worried about his emotional state than his physical state is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the man has been stabbed in the back, he is more concerned about the tone of voice his girlfriend used when she broke up with him, implying that he values his ego over his physical wellbeing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man was stabbed in the back, which is often associated with the phrase "stabbing someone in the back," meaning to betray them. The woman he was talking to on the phone probably said something to upset or anger him, but it wasn't as bad as the betrayal of being stabbed in the back.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man has been stabbed in the back, but he is still on the phone and seems more concerned with the tone of voice his girlfriend used when she said something, rather than the fact that he has been stabbed. This highlights how phone conversations can be more abstract and impersonal than face-to-face interactions, where the physicality of being stabbed in the back would be more apparent.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man has been stabbed in the back, but he's more concerned with the way his girlfriend sounded on the phone. This implies that she was the one who stabbed him, and he's more upset about her tone than the actual act of betrayal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who has been stabbed is more concerned about the tone of voice his wife used than the fact that she stabbed him. He is presumably more worried about their relationship than the fact that he is in pain and bleeding. The joke is a play on the fact that, when people get stabbed, they are more concerned about their injury than anything else.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is more concerned with the tone of his girlfriend's voice than the fact that he's been stabbed. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the "it" could refer to either the situation with the girlfriend or the situation with the knife. The double meaning is what makes the joke humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who has been stabbed is more concerned about the tone of voice his wife used when she stabbed him than the fact that he has been stabbed. This reaction is disproportionate to the situation, making it humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man was stabbed in the back, so when he says "It's not so much what she said as how she said it," he is literally referring to the fact that he was stabbed in the back. However, the phrasing can also be interpreted to mean that the woman who stabbed him said something mean to him, and he is more upset about the way she said it than the actual words she used.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is more concerned about the tone of voice his wife used when she said she was going to stab him than the fact that she actually did stab him. He is clearly more worried about the argument they were having than his own physical wellbeing. The joke is clever because it uses a play on words: the word "betray" can mean both to break a promise/commit treason, and also to stab someone in the back.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has been stabbed and is in the process of dying, but he is still more concerned with the way his wife said something than the actual content of what she said. He is priorities are completely out of line, and the incongruity is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="38.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="40.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
