The man with the paper is searching for "rats," but the other two men are carrying an actual rat (a snake). This confusion is caused by the fact that the rat is so big that it could be mistaken for a snake.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The actual scenario is that two men are bringing a very large snake into an office building, which is strange and potentially dangerous. However, the man with the paper is looking for rats, not snakes. This is a pun on the fact that "snakes" and "rats" are often used interchangeably to refer to people who are considered to be sneaky, untrustworthy, or malicious.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "looking for a needle in a haystack." The men are looking for rats, which are smaller than snakes, so it would be even harder to find them. The joke is also funny because it's a pun on the name of the New York City subway line, the "23rd Street line."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men are bringing a snake into the office, which would be considered dangerous and disruptive. The fact that they say they are looking for rats that escaped from the subway's Track 23 dining room kitchen implies that they are either lying or that they are not familiar with the office they are in. Either way, it's a humorous situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's an absurd euphemism for the fact that the men are actually looking for a way to dispose of the snake. They can't very well just let it loose in the office, so they have to find a place to put it where it won't be found. The euphemism points to the absurd lengths people will go to to avoid saying something directly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is so absurd. It's implausible that there would be a snake that big, and it's even more implausible that the men would be carrying it into an office building. Furthermore, the man with the paper is probably an exterminator, and the joke implies that the rat problem in the subway is so bad that they've resorted to bringing in a snake to eat them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men who are carrying the snake are doing so in a way that makes it clear they are not comfortable with it. They are also stopped by a third man who has a piece of paper in his hand, which implies that he is in charge of the situation. The fact that they are looking for rats that have escaped from the subway's Track 23 dining room kitchen suggests that they are not going to find them in the office, which is where the snakes are.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "rat" can refer to a rodent, or it can refer to a person who is dishonest or unethical. In this case, the man with the paper is referring to the latter meaning of "rat," implying that the two men carrying the snake are dishonest or unethical. This is ironic because snakes are often associated with deceit and betrayal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men are carrying a giant snake through the office, and the man looking at them says they're searching for rats. This is confusing because snakes are often used to catch rats; why would they be looking for rats if they have a snake with them? The joke may be making a commentary on the inefficiency of the office, or it may be a non-sequitur.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man with the paper is asking the other men what they are doing with the snake, and they reply that they are looking for rats. However, the way they say it, "Track 23 dining room kitchen," sounds like they are saying "track 2, 3rd dining room, kitchen," which is a room in a building where food is prepared. So, the joke is that the men are actually looking for rats in the kitchen, but they are pretending that they are looking for them in the subway.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man with the paper is asking the men carrying the snake if they're the "rat catchers" that he ordered; they say they are, but they're actually snake catchers who are looking for rats. This is funny because it's a reversal of the expected roles.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "searching for a needle in a haystack." The men are looking for rats, which are much smaller than the snake, so it's unlikely that they will find them. The man with the paper is probably an exterminator who has been hired to deal with the rat problem, and he is not amused.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The men carrying the snake are looking for rats, and the snake is going to eat the rats. However, the man looking at them is saying that they are looking for the rats that escaped from the subway, which are the subway rats. This is a play on the phrase "searching for a needle in a haystack."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The men are carrying a huge snake, which could be interpreted as a "subway," and they are looking for "rats." But, the "rats" they are looking for are actual rats, not people, which is what the listener would expect. The joke is also funny because it's unexpected to find a snake in an office.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men are carrying a snake into the office, which would typically be used to eat rats. In this case, however, they claim to be looking for rats, which makes it clear that they are not going to be used for their intended purpose. The joke is a play on the fact that snakes are often used to kill rats, but in this case, they are being used to find them.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
