In other words, they are asking how much of the story is "autobiographical" --- meaning, how much of it is based on the man's actual life.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "autobiographical" means relating to someone's own life story.
