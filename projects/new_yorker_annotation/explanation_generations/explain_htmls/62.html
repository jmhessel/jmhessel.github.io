The old man is confusing the word "reservation" (a spot that has been set aside, in this case at a restaurant) with the word "reservation" (an emotional state of being).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. In this context, "reservations" can mean two things: 1) a hotel room or other accommodation that has been set aside in advance and 2) doubts or qualifying a statement. In the first sense, the old man is saying that everyone who is here at the mountain top restaurant has a room set aside (has made a reservation), while in the second sense, the old man is saying that everyone has doubts or is hesitant about something (has reservations).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the monk is saying that everyone at the restaurant has reservations, which is a normal thing to say. However, the context of the situation---that they are all sitting on a mountain eating dinner---implies that they might not have made reservations at the restaurant, but rather, they have reservations about eating dinner on a mountain.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is climbing the mountain has made a classical error --- he has assumed that because he has hiked to the top of the mountain, he will be the only one there. In reality, there are other people who have taken a different route to get to the top, and they are already enjoying a meal at the restaurant. The joke is a play on words, because the man has both made a physical reservation (i.e., he has a reservation at the restaurant) and a psychological one (i.e., he has assumed that he will be the only one at the top of the mountain).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the monk is talking to the mountain climber about how everyone has reservations about something --- in other words, that everyone has their doubts, or is hesitate about something. In this case, the monk is referring to the fact that everyone has a reservation at the restaurant, but the mountain climber might think that the monk is talking about something else entirely.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the word "reservations" has two meanings: first, it can refer to a place that has been set aside for a specific purpose (like a reservation for a hotel room); second, it can refer to a lack of certainty or a feeling of doubt (I have reservations about that plan). In this case, the monk is using the second meaning of the word, telling the mountain climber that everyone has concerns or doubts about his decision to climb the mountain. However, the fact that there are people eating dinner at tables on the mountain implies that the first meaning of "reservation" is also true: there must be a restaurant or some other dining establishment on the mountain, meaning that people have intentionally set aside this space for the purpose of eating. Thus, the monk's statement is both true and funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The monk is saying that everyone has a reservation, which can mean either that they have a table booked at a restaurant, or that they are feeling hesitant about something. In this case, the monk is saying that everyone is hesitant about the mountain, which makes sense given that it is a dangerous place to be.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man at the top of the cliff is trying to impart some wisdom to the explorer, but the explorer is more interested in the restaurant that is at the top of the cliff. The man is trying to tell the explorer that we all have our own journey to make in life, but the explorer is fixated on the destination.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man at the top of the cliff is trying to tell the explorer that everyone has a place at the table, implying that the explorer is welcome to join them. However, the word "reservations" can also refer to the fact that the explorer probably made a reservation at the restaurant in advance, and so he already has a place at the table. This double meaning is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "reservations". The monk is saying that everyone at the restaurant has a reservation, i.e., they booked a table in advance. However, the mountain climber might also be interpreted as saying that he has reservations about the safety of eating on the side of a cliff. The joke works because eating at a restaurant usually isn't a dangerous activity, but the context of being on a cliff makes it dangerous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man climbing the mountain has "reservations" about being there, because it is a dangerous and difficult task. However, the old man at the top of the mountain says that everyone has "reservations" because they have all reserved a spot at the restaurant. The joke is clever because it is both a pun and a play on the different meanings of the word "reservation."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The monk is saying that everyone at the table has reservations, which can mean either that they have a planned spot at the table or that they are uncertain about something. In the former case, it would be because they all made reservations at the restaurant ahead of time; in the latter case, it would be because they all have doubts about whether or not they should be eating on a mountain. The double meaning of the word is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because once the explorer reaches the top of the mountain, he finds that everything is already full and there are no more spots available. The joke is a play on words because in order to get a table at a restaurant, usually one needs to make a reservation in advance, but in this case, everyone has already done so.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man climbing the mountain has "reservations" about whether he should continue his journey because he is greeted by an old man and people at tables, which looks like a restaurant. However, the old man says that they all have "reservations" --- which in this context means that they have a table booked at the restaurant. So the old man is telling the climber that he doesn't need to worry, because they have a table waiting for them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the play on words: the man reaching the top of the mountain is likely tired and hungry, so he's looking forward to a meal. However, the old man says that they all have "reservations," meaning that they have a table booked at a restaurant, rather than food that's been prepared in advance.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="61.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="63.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
