The curfew in this situation is the curfew that many drivers face after they've had a few drinks --- i.e., they are not allowed to drive home because they might get into a car accident. In this situation, a car has literally crashed into the house, and the man says that at least the driver made curfew, i.e., he wasn't driving after he'd had a few drinks.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "curfew" can mean two things: a) a rule that dictates when people must be indoors; b) the hour at which a curfew starts. In this situation, the curfew is the b) second definition, meaning the hour at which the car crashed into the house. The joke is that the car made it home on time, but unfortunately not in the way the parents would have wanted.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a dark humor comment on how the situation could have been worse: instead of crashing into the bedroom while the occupants were sleeping, the car waited until they were done with their nightly activities before crashing through the roof. By making a joke about how the situation could have been worse, the speaker is dissipating some of the tension and shock that comes with a car crashing into one's bedroom.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the car has crashed into the house at night, and the man and woman in bed are more concerned with the fact that their son has made curfew than with the fact that there is a car in their bedroom. This is a play on the common parent worry that their child will be out late at night and get into trouble, rather than the much more immediate worry of a car crashing through the ceiling.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is making a joke in the midst of a dangerous situation. The fact that their son has made curfew, meaning he's home on time, is a trivial concern compared to the fact that their house has just been crashed into. However, the woman's joke highlights the normality of their son being home on time, despite the fact that their house is in shambles.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because while a car crashing through the roof is a very dangerous and possibly deadly situation, the speaker is more concerned with the fact that their son made it home by curfew. This is a play on the fact that parents are often more concerned with their children's whereabouts and safety than with their own, even in potentially life-threatening situations.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is so absurd: a car has crashed into the bedroom, but the man's only concern is that his son has made it home by curfew. The fact that he is more worried about his son's curfew than the fact that there is a car in their bedroom emphasizes just how normal this situation must be for them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a light-hearted way to deflect from the situation's inherent seriousness. The boy likely wouldn't have made curfew had he not crashed his car into the house, yet the speaker downplays the danger and damage by making a joke about it. While a car crashing into a bedroom is certainly not ideal, the speaker is trying to find the silver lining in a disastrous situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the car crashing into the wall has interrupted what was presumably about to be a sexual encounter. In addition, the fact that the people involved are naked makes the joke funnier, suggesting that they were in the middle of undressing each other. The reference to curfew is also funny because it is a common rule for teenagers, who are not usually associated with having sex.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is making a joke about how his son (or possibly another driver) made it home by curfew, despite the fact that he crashed his car. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the word "curfew" can refer to the time when people are supposed to be off the streets, but it can also refer to the time when people are supposed to be in their homes. In this case, the driver made it "home" by curfew, even though he technically destroyed his home in the process.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the guests in the bedroom are more concerned about the fact that the driver made curfew (arrived home by a certain time) than the fact that he crashed his car through their ceiling. The fact that they are more concerned about a curfew than a car crash is unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The car "made" curfew because it crashed into the wall at curfew. But, the boy also "made" curfew because he is in the bedroom, suggesting he is home at curfew. The fact that he is naked in bed with a girl implies that he was breaking curfew to have sex, which is a more serious offense than simply being out late.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is not upset about a car crashing into their bedroom; in fact, they seem more relieved than anything. The joke is a play on the fact that, usually, when parents are waiting up for their kids to come home, they are worried about them being in a car accident. However, in this case, the couple is actually happy that their son made it home (i.e. before the curfew they set for him) despite crashing his car into their bedroom.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the car crashing into the wall has created a hole, and the son who was driving the car is now in the house. The mother is glad that he made it home on time, despite the destruction he has caused.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is more concerned with their son being home on time than the fact that a car has crashed through their ceiling. This implies that this is a fairly common occurrence, and they are used to it.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
