The man is exasperated, and suggests that the dog could at least bark, which would be some form of warning or protection. The joke is clever because it plays on the expected behavior of both the dog and the werewolf.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's comment to the werewolf is a play on the fact that werewolves are often associated with the moon, and how dogs usually bark at the moon. In this case, the man is telling the werewolf that it should at least bark, since it's acting like a dog. The werewolf, of course, can't bark because it's not really a dog.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is talking to his dog as if the werewolf is not a big deal, when in reality, a werewolf is a very dangerous creature. The man is scolding his dog for not being more scared/protective, when he should be the one being scared.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is scolding his dog for not warning him of the werewolf's presence. Even though dogs are known for barking when they see something unusual, the man seems to expect more from his dog than just barking. He wants his dog to be able to warn him of danger, even though he himself can see the werewolf and should be able to understand the danger he's in.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is scolding his dog for being afraid of the werewolf, when he should be scolding the werewolf for being a mythical creature that is terrorizing them. The fact that the man is more concerned with his dog's lack of bravery than the werewolf itself is weird and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the dog is afraid of the werewolf, the man is more annoyed than anything else. The man is saying that the least the dog could do is bark, which is atypical (usually, it's the other way around, with the dog barking and the man telling it to be quiet). In this case, the man is more worried about the werewolf knowing they are there than the actual danger the werewolf presents.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's dog is not barking at the werewolf, despite the fact that dogs normally bark when they see strangers or strange animals. The man is scolding his dog for not responding appropriately to the werewolf, suggesting that he expects the dog to know that the werewolf is a danger and to bark accordingly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog, usually considered man's best friend, is not living up to the expected role of alerting its owner to danger. In this case, the danger is a werewolf, which is a mythical creature, so the dog's failure to bark is not as serious as it would be if the danger were real. However, the man's irritation at the dog's inaction is still humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is more annoyed than scared at the werewolf, and he tells his dog to bark even though it's a mythical creature. The barking would be ineffective against the werewolf, but the man's face suggests that he's more annoyed with the dog than the werewolf.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words; the man is telling the werewolf that it could at least "bark", meaning make a noise, but the werewolf is actually a dog, so the man is telling it to bark like a normal dog would. This reversal is unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "bark" can mean two things: the noise a dog makes, or the protective outer layer of a tree. In this case, the man is telling the werewolf that it should at least make a noise like a dog, since it is in the form of a dog. But, since the werewolf is actually a tree, the man is also telling it to bark in the sense of protecting him from the werewolf. The joke is clever because it works on multiple levels.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is more annoyed than scared at the werewolf, even though it's a dangerous creature. He's telling his dog to at least bark, as if the dog's inaction is more bothersome than the werewolf itself. This is a play on the saying "you could at least say something," which is often used when someone is disappointed by someone else's lack of response to a situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common phrase "barking up the wrong tree." In this case, the man is telling the werewolf that it's barking up the wrong tree by attacking him, when it should be attacking the dog instead. The joke is also clever because it's a play on words; the werewolf is actually barking, but the man is telling it to bark as if it weren't.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is more annoyed than scared at the werewolf, even though he is clearly in danger. The dog, on the other hand, is very scared, and the man is telling it to bark, as if that would somehow help the situation. The joke is clever because it uses the fact that dogs barking is often associated with warning their owners of danger, even though in this case, it would be completely useless.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "you could at least act like you care." In this situation, the dog is not acting like he would if he were encountering a werewolf for the first time. The dog should be barking and trying to protect his owner, but instead he is just calmly walking next to him. This makes it appear as if the man is used to werewolves and is unphased by them.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
