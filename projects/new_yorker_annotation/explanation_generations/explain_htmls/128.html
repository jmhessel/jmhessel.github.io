In this context, "gatherers" refers to the small cavemen on top of the mammoth, who are presumably hunting it. However, the word "gatherer" can also refer to someone who gathers food. So, the joke is that the mammoth on the right is saying that the small cavemen are more trouble than the gatherers who just gathered food.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The "problem" the speaker is referring to is the hunting of the mammoths, but the word "problem" can also be used to refer to something that is pregnant (carrying a baby). In this case, the joke is implying that the mammoth is pregnant and the hunters are trying to kill the baby. This is a dark joke because it is talking about hunting and death, but it is also humorous because it is a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "gatherer" can mean someone who collects things, but it can also mean someone who hunts and gathers food. In this context, the joke is about how the hunters are now the hunted, and how the tables have turned. The irony is that the hunters are now the prey of the very animals they used to hunt.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="127.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="129.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
