You have no idea.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "last call": in a bar, "last call" is the announcement made last thing at night telling people they need to finish their drinks and leave; however, in this context, "last call" refers to the fact that the man sitting at the bar is about to die, and so this is his literal last call.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the grim reaper is, of course, the personification of death. So, when the man offers him a drink at "last call", the reaper is literally the last person who would ever need a drink.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is drinking in a bar and Death is sitting a ways away. The man is offering Death a beer, which is ironic because the man is about to die. The man doesn't realize that he's about to die, but Death does, which makes the situation funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the bar is telling Death that he has no idea when the last call at the bar is, because Death, who represents the end of life, is the ultimate last call.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the fact that, in most bars, last call is typically around 1:00 or 2:00am. However, in this bar, last call is much later --- in fact, it's whenever Satan decides to leave. The lady offering Satan a beer is likely hopeful that he'll stayed longer (and buy more drinks), hence her happy mood.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the grim reaper is, of course, the personification of death. Thus, when the man at the bar asks if it's last call, the grim reaper replies with a double-meaning: technically, yes, it is last call at the bar --- but also, for the man, it is literally his last call because the reaper is there to take him away.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while "last call" at a bar is typically when the bartender announces that the bar is closing and customers need to finish their drinks, in this case, the man is talking to Death, who represents the ultimate last call. The man's comment is funny because it's a way of stalling for time, of trying to keep Death at bay by offering him a drink, when really, there's nothing that can be done to stop Death from coming.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because thejoke is a play on words. "Last call" at a bar usually means that the bar is about to close, and so customers should order their last drink. In this case, "last call" refers to the fact that the man is drinking with Death, who is often seen as the personification of death. Thus, the man is effectively having his "last call" in the sense that he is about to die.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it turns the traditional understanding of "last call" at a bar on its head. In most bars, "last call" is the announcement made towards the end of the night letting people know that they need to finish their drinks and that the bar will be closing soon. However, in this instance, the "last call" is being made by Satan himself, indicating that this particular bar is located in Hell, and the lady is offering him a drink.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully pokes at the idea that Satan, as the embodiment of death, is often imagined as being very old. In this case, the lady at the bar is telling Satan that he has no idea how late it is: "last call" at a bar means that the bar is about to close and no more drinks will be served, but for Satan, who represents ultimate death, there is no "last call" --- death is always open.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a bar, "last call" is usually announced over the PA system to signal to patrons that the bar is about to close and that they should order their last drinks. In this case, the man is telling Death that he has no idea what last call truly is --- implying that, for Death, there is no last call, and that he is probably going to die soon.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully imagines the grim reaper as a regular guy who just happens to have a scary job. The man offering him a drink assumes that the reaper is just like him, only at the end of his night, when in reality, the reaper is there to symbolize the end of the man's life.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the bar is offering a beer to Death, who is often thought of as a Grim Reaper-type figure that comes to take people away when their time is up. In this case, the man is joking that Death is actually way past last call, since he is, in fact, Death.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is continuing to drink even though he's acknowledged that death is in the room with him. He makes a lighthearted joke about how death probably doesn't know when last call is --- meaning, of course, that death is the last call for him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is completely unaware that he is talking to Death. He thinks they are both just at the bar, drinking, when in reality, the other person is Death. The man's comment about "last call" takes on a new meaning when applied to Death: while for the man, it's simply the last call for drinks at the bar, for Death, it's the last call for the man's life.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="127.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="129.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
