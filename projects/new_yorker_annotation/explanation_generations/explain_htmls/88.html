The joke works because it is a play on words --- "God" can refer to the Christian god, or it can refer to the concept of gravity. In this case, it is the latter meaning that is intended, as the man is literally being held up by gravity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the office is Float-ing, as in he is on the phone with someone and he needs to call them back because he is being interrupted by a divine being. This is a humorous way of saying that the person is being interrupted by something important and they will call the person back later.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is impossible: the man and the furniture are floating in the air, which goes against the law of gravity. The man must have been on the phone with God, who is presumably holding the line while the man is dealing with this impossible situation. This is a humorous way to explain away the impossible scene.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the office is literally being held up by God, as evidenced by the furniture and himself floating in the air, and he is on the phone with someone else. However, he tells the person on the other end of the line that he will call them back, because he left God holding on the other line. This is funny because it implies that the person he is talking to is not as important as God, who is holding him up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in the office is so nonchalant about the situation, as if it's a normal thing that happens, when in reality, it's completely bizarre. The joke also pokes fun at people who act like they are always busy and important by saying that they even have God on hold.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is saying that he will call the person back, but the reason he can't talk right now is because he left "God holding on the other line." The word "God" is often used as a replacement for "good" in phrases like "That's good!" or "Thank god!" in order to avoid saying blasphemous things. In this case, the man has actually left thelord holding on the other line, which is blasphemous, and thus, funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person is acknowledging that the situation is surreal and gravity-defying, but instead of being scared or confused, he is flippant and makes a joke. The joke itself is a play on words, as the speaker is saying that he will call the person back, but the reason he can't talk now is because he left "god" on hold. This is humorous because it's a way of saying that the speaker is talking to a higher power, or that the situation is so strange that it must be caused by a higher power.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is clearly in the middle of an earthquake, and is about to be crushed by his desk, yet he is more concerned with finishing his phone call than saving himself. The joke implies that the man is so arrogant that he believes that even God cannot save him from an earthquake, and thus he is not worth interrupting his phone call.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is literally suspended in the air, and he is trying to call someone back, but he says that he left God holding on the other line. This is a pun because the man is trying to say that he is in the middle of something (he is literally in the middle of the room) and that he will call the person back later.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is acting like it is perfectly normal for things to be floating in the air, when in reality, it is not. The joke is also a play on the phrase "I have to call you back, I have someone on the other line," which implies that the person is busy and can't talk. In this joke, the person is busy because they are talking to God.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is talking on the phone and says he has to call the person back because he left God holding on the other line. The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "I have to call you back, I have someone on the other line." In this case, the other line is not another person, but God. The joke is also funny because it's a reference to the movie "Bruce Almighty", where the main character is given God's telephone number and is able to talk to him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is talking on the phone while everything in the room, including himself, is floating in the air. This is most likely due to an earthquake, which would explain why he would need to call God. The joke is clever because it plays on the idea that when you are on the phone with someone, you are technically "on hold" with everyone else.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's conversation implies that he is talking to another person about an earthquake, a natural disaster that can cause furniture and people to float in the air. The man nonchalantly mentions that he has to go because he left God holding on the other line, as if it's an everyday occurrence to leave God on hold. The joke is a play on the common saying "let me call you back", which is often used when someone is interrupted during a phone conversation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of an earthquake, it is a natural disaster that is beyond the control of any human, implying that the person on the other line is God. The joke is also a play on the phrase "I have to call you back, I have someone on the other line," implying that the other person on the line is not as important as the person suspended in the air during an earthquake.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is literally "suspended" in the air, but he is also telling the person on the other line of the phone that he will call them back, implying that he is too busy to talk at the moment. The joke is clever because it is a double meaning: the man is both literally and figuratively suspended.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="87.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="89.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
