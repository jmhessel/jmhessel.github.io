In contrast, the term "high interest lender" is associated with being someone who provides loans at a high interest rate, but isn't considered to be nearly as dangerous as a shark. Therefore, the shark is saying that it would rather be seen as a high interest lender than a ruthless predator, which is a humorous turnaround.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the shark is trying to downplay his occupation by saying that he is simply a "high interest lender." This is a play on words because while sharks do lend money (in the form of prey), they typically do so at a high interest rate (i.e., they eat their prey).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in this context, the term "high interest lender" is a play on words. A "high interest lender" is a person or company who charges a higher interest rate than average on loans. However, in this context, the shark is the one who is lending money (presumably to the police officers), and he is charging a high interest rate. The joke is clever because it is a play on words, and it is also a play on the stereotype that sharks are greedy creatures.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because sharks are often associated with being ruthless predators who are only interested in killing and eating their prey. In contrast, the shark in the police station is being interrogated for information, and he is refusing to cooperate. The joke is clever because it playfully inverts the common stereotype of sharks.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the shark is in a room usually occupied by criminals being interrogated by police officers. However, since the shark is a loan shark, which is a type of criminal that lends money with very high interest rates, the Shark is trying to turn the tables on the officers and act like he's the one in charge.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because sharks are normally associated with being ruthless predators who kill their prey. However, the cop is suggesting that the shark is more like a loan shark, which is a term for a person who lends money at extremely high interest rates, often to people who are desperate and can't get loans from traditional sources. The joke is clever because it uses the common stereotype of sharks being dangerous predators to make a pun about another type of predator: loan sharks.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the "high interest lender" and the "shark." A high interest lender is a legitimate business, while a shark is associated with being a loan shark, which is an illegal enterprise. The joke is also funny because the shark is trying to present himself in a positive light, but the cops are not fooled.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the shark is technically a loan shark, which is somebody who loans money at high interest rates. However, the term "loan shark" has a negative connotation, so the shark is trying to avoid that label by saying that it's simply a "high interest lender." But of course, this is just a play on words and doesn't change the fact that the shark is a loan shark.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is interrogating the shark about something, and the shark is trying to be evasive. He's clearly done something wrong, but he's trying to downplay his involvement by saying that he's just a "high interest lender." This is a play on words because, while technically he is a high interest lender, the cop is probably more interested in finding out what he did that was illegal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because sharks are notorious for being loan sharks, which are illegal. So, when the shark is asked what he does for a living, he jokingly responds that he's a "high interest lender."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is questioning the shark about committing a crime, but the shark is refusing to cooperate. The shark is instead making a joke about how he is actually a financial predator who takes advantage of people with high interest rates. This is a play on words because the term "high interest lender" is usually used to describe someone who is not a shark.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the shark is in an interrogation room, which is usually a place for humans. The shark is trying to act like a human by using slang terms, but his literal translation of the term "loan shark" gives away his true identity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the police officers are interrogating the shark, the shark is trying to act like it's not a shark. He's instead trying to play off of the stereotype that sharks are often interested in money and are ruthless lenders. However, the police officers are not fooled by this, and they continue to interrogate the shark.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in this situation, the shark is being interrogated for being a loan shark, which is a person who illegally offers loans at very high interest rates. The shark is trying to downplay his illegal activities by instead saying that he's just a "high interest lender."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because sharks are often associated with being ruthless predators, and the idea of a shark being interrogated by police is absurd. The joke plays on the fact that sharks are often considered to be "lenders" of a sort, because they loan out their teeth to humans (who use them as dental implants).</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="87.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="89.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
