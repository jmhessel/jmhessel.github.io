In this context, the joke is clever because the person in the space suit is not just taking a small step, but a giant leap (forward in the elevator), which the operator should be wary of.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "watch your step" is usually a warning to be careful not to fall, but in this context, it becomes a warning not to step on the small person.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reversal of the expected situation. Instead of the astronaut being on an alien planet and having to be careful of a small step, he's on Earth in a hotel, and it's the butler who needs to be careful of the small step. The joke is a play on the phrase "watch your step," which is usually said as a warning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The astronaut is being told to watch his step, but in a literal sense, he needs to be careful because the step is small. On the other hand, the astronaut is also being told to be careful in a figurative sense because he's about to take a big step, off of the elevator and back on to planet Earth.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the space suit is so big that the person is unlikely to miss the small step, which the operator is warning them about. The operator's warning is unnecessary and humorous because of the size difference between the two.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "watch your step." The phrase is usually used as a warning not to trip or fall, but in this case, it is a warning not to step off the elevator and into space. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the stereotype of elevator operators being old and cranky.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the space suit is so large that the person is worryingly close to the edge of the elevator platform. The small step warning is usually given to people who are wearing normal clothes and shoes, but in this case, it's comically oversized for the space suit.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the space suit is so incongruous with the elevator operator's uniform and the small step he's warning the space-suited individual about. The joke suggests that perhaps space-suited individuals are so used to floating in zero gravity that they might not be able to tell the difference between the elevator's floor and the small step leading out of it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the phrase "one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." The situation is absurd because an astronaut is coming out of an elevator, and the butler is telling him to watch his step, as if he's going to take a small step and then a giant leap. The joke is clever because it's a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the phrase "watch your step." On one hand, the astronaut needs to be careful because he is on a small step (the edge of the elevator). On the other hand, the joke is funny because the man is dressed as an astronaut, implying that he is not really an astronaut and is just a man in a costume.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it puns on the danger of a "small step" often used in the context of space exploration. It's a small step for man, but a giant leap for mankind. If you take a small step on earth, it's not a big deal, but if you take a small step in space, it could be disastrous. In this case, the man dressed as an astronaut is about to take a small step on earth, but the usher is warning him to be careful, as if he were in space.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: "small step" can refer to the amount of space an astronaut has to take when exiting an elevator, or it can refer to the historic "giant leap" taken by humans when they first landed on the moon. In this case, the astronaut is so used to taking small steps in space that he doesn't realize he's on Earth and can take a much larger step. The butler's reminder to take a small step is a gentle way of correcting him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the astronaut is on earth, and therefore doesn't need to worry about the perils of space, like a small step. The usher is telling him to be careful anyway, emphasizing the mundanity of everyday life in contrast to the excitement of space travel.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is not actually an astronaut; he's just dressed as one. However, the usher is treating him as if he is an astronaut and is warning him to watch his step. This is funny because astronauts are usually very careful and well-trained, so it's unexpected that the usher would need to give him this warning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the astronaut is on Earth, and therefore there is no need for him to be cautious of a "small step." The joke is a play on words, using the common idiomatic phrase "watch your step" which means to be careful, and the literal meaning of "step" as a unit of measurement.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="171.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="173.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
