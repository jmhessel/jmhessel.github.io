The "mask" the dog is referring to is actually a cone, which is commonly called an "Elizabethan collar." The joke is that the owner is also wearing a cone, but on his face, which covers his mouth like a mask. This hypothetical situation is funny because it's not entirely clear how the owner would be able to eat or drink with the cone on his face.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a pun on the word "cone." Elizabethan collars, or "cones," are often worn by dogs to prevent them from licking their wounds. In this case, the cone is placed on the dog's head backwards, making it useless. The joke is that the other dog says that his owner wears his "mask" in the same way --- backwards and useless.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The Elizabethan collar is a cone-shaped device that is put on animals to prevent them from scratching themselves; it's also called a "cone of shame" because the animal looks silly with it on. In this situation, one of the dogs is making a joke about how his owner is wearing a mask incorrectly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. When a person wears a mask, it is typically to protect themselves from getting germs from other people. However, the dog is saying that the other dog's owner is not wearing the mask properly, which means that the owner is not protected from getting germs. This is a reversal of the typical scenario, which makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words; the Elizabethan collar is a type of "cone" that's placed around animals' necks to prevent them from licking their wounds. The dog's owner is wearing a mask, which is also cone-shaped, but is placed around the face for a completely different purpose: to prevent the spreading of germs. The dog's owner, like the dog, is wearing their cone "backwards".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog's owner is not following the proper protocol for wearing a mask, which is to wear it over the nose and mouth. Instead, the owner is wearing it backwards, which might be seen as humorous by the other dog.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because dogs typically aren't known for having a sense of humor. It's even more surprising that one of the dogs is making a joke about the coronavirus pandemic, given that dogs can't contract the virus. The dog with the ineffective cone is making a dig at the other dog's owner, who is presumably not taking the pandemic seriously if they aren't wearing a mask properly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The Elizabethan collar is a cone-shaped device meant to keep animals from biting or licking their injuries, and is also known as an "E-collar." The dog on the right is saying that if the other dog wants to see something funny, he should see how his owner wears his mask, with the "mask" being a reference to the cone-shaped E-collar.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog wearing the backwards cone is making a joke about how humans are wearing masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The dog implies that the person wearing the mask is not wearing it correctly, similar to how the dog's own cone is backwards.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is wearing a cone around his neck to keep him from scratching his head, but the cone is backward, so it's not doing its job. The other dog is saying that if he thinks that's bad, he should see how his owner wears his mask, which is also backward and thus not effective.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because dogs typically only wear cones when they have been spayed or neutered, which is a very intimate surgery. The fact that one dog is wearing the cone backwards implies that its owner is not taking the proper precautions to prevent the dog from getting pregnant or impregnating other dogs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully pokes at the current trend of dog owners dressing up their pets in human clothes to make them look cuter (a trend which has unfortunately led to some dogs getting injured or even killed). In this case, the dog is saying that their owner is so fashionable that they even wear their mask backwards.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is talking about how his owner is wearing a mask, but the dog is wearing a cone around his head, which is usually used to prevent animals from licking their wounds. The dog's comment implies that the cone is actually a mask, and that the dog's owner is wearing it wrong --- the cone is supposed to go around the head, not over the face!</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the Elizabethan collar (a type of cone placed around an animal's neck to keep them from licking their wounds) and the fact that the dog's owner is wearing a mask (likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic). The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the Elizabethan collar is supposed to go around the "neck", but in this case, it's around the "head".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The dog is wearing an Elizabethan collar, which is also called a "cone of shame" because it's often seen as embarrassing or humiliating to have to wear one. In contrast, the other dog is wearing its cone properly, but the joke is that the owner is the one who is embarrassed or humiliated --- implying that the owner is the one who should be wearing the cone, not the dog.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="171.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="173.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
