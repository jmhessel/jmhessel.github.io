The joke is also funny because it's a play on the fact that tubas are often used in marching bands to help keep the rhythm, but in this case, the tubas are being used to keep people away.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men have the tubas for the sole purpose of keeping people away from them. The fact that neither of them know how to play the instrument is irrelevant. This is a clever way to social distance oneself in a crowded elevator.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because people often try to avoid eye contact and personal space invasions when they're in an elevator with other people. The fact that the men have tubas strapped around their waists makes it even more likely that people would want to avoid them, since tubas are large and unwieldy instruments.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men with the tubas are using them as weapons. The joke is clever because it is a play on the fact that tubas are generally large and unwieldy instruments, so carrying one would likely keep people at a safe distance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men who are carrying around tubas in the elevator clearly don't know how to play them, but they've found that the large size of the instrument is useful for keeping people at a distance --- in other words, they are using the tubas as a form of social distancing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men have tubas with them, but they don't play them. The tubas probably make a lot of noise, and the men are using them to intentionally keep people away from them. This is clever because it's an effective way to use the tubas, even though they are not being played.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men with tubas are using them as a way to keep people at a distance, similar to how people might use mace or pepper spray. Tubas are usually only seen in settings such as marching bands or symphonies, so the idea of using them as a personal defense mechanisms is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "plays". The first meaning is that the tubas are musical instruments, and neither man playing them knows how to play them. The second meaning is that tubas are often used as a prop in silly situations to make people laugh; in this case, the men are using them to keep people a safe distance away from them in the elevator, due to the current pandemic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men with the tubas around their waist are saying that they don't know how to play the instrument, but they find that the tubas are effective in keeping other people a safe distance away from them --- a distance that is recommended to prevent the spread of disease. This is particularly relevant in the current COVID-19 pandemic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men in the elevator are using the tubas as a way to keep people at a distance. This is a play on the idea that tubas are large and cumbersome instruments that not many people can play. The fact that the two men aren't playing the instruments but are still using them to keep people away is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men with the tubas are using them as a way to keep people away from them, perhaps because they are socially awkward or because they don't want to talk to anyone. The joke implies that the men with the tubas are using them as a way to create personal space, which is an unusual way to use a musical instrument.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men have tubas, which are large, cumbersome instruments, and they are using them as a way to keep people at a distance. The fact that they don't even play the tubas makes it even funnier, because it suggests that they are using them purely for the purpose of keeping people away.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the stereotype that tubas are large and unwieldy instruments that are difficult to play. In reality, the two men with tubas are using them as a way to keep people at a distance, possibly due to the current pandemic. The joke is clever because it takes a familiar object and sets it in an unusual context, using it for a purpose other than what it is commonly used for.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men with the tubas are saying that they don't play the instrument, but they find that the tubas are effective in keeping other people a safe distance away from them. This is likely a reference to the current social distancing guidelines during the coronavirus pandemic, where people are advised to stay six feet away from each other to reduce the spread of the disease.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because people usually don't want to be around other people when they are riding in an elevator, so the fact that these two men have found a way to ensure that people stay at least six feet away from them is humorous. The double-meaning of "play" is also funny, because it can refer to playing an instrument or playing a game. In this case, it refers to both: the men are playing the tuba instruments, and they are also playing a game by trying to keep people away from them.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="133.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="135.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
