In the context of the situation, the cat is on her ninth life because she is sitting on top of a beach ball that is flying through the air. If the beach ball were to fall and the cat were to fall with it, the cat would likely die, since cats can't swim. Thus, the cat is in a precarious position and is effectively using up one of her nine lives.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that cats have nine lives. In this case, the cat is on its ninth life but is not aware that it is about to use up its last life by sitting on top of a beach ball that is being tossed around. The fact that the cat is unaware of the danger it is in makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="133.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="135.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
