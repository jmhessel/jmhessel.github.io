The sommelier is the wine expert at the restaurant, so offering to have them bring the wine list implies that the menu is so large that it's overwhelming and the man needs help choosing what to eat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while a menu is a list of dishes that a restaurant offers, a wine list is a list of wines that a restaurant offers. The waiter's suggestion is funny because it's a non-sequitur; the man didn't ask for the wine list, and even if he had, it's not something that the waiter would need to go fetch. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the waiter is suggesting that the sommelier (a wine expert) "drag over" the wine list, but the word "drag" can also mean to pull something forcefully or with difficulty. So the waiter is also suggesting that the wine list is heavy, which it likely is given its size.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "sommelier" is a wine steward, but in this context, it sounds like the waiter is saying that he can have the "slimier" (or, more accurately, the "slime-ier") drag over the wine list. This is a play on the fact that "sommelier" and "slime" sound similar.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man ordering has a menu that is so large, it's obstructing the waiter's view. The waiter's sarcastic suggestion that he get the wine list to add to the man's already towering pile of menus is a clever jab at the customer's excessive ordering.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's menu is so large that it is blocking the waiter's view of him. The waiter's comment about the sommelier is a play on the fact that usually, menus are much smaller and can be easily placed to the side, but in this case, the menu is so big that it is taking up an excessive amount of space.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. A sommelier is a wine steward, but in this case, the waiter is suggesting that the sommelier can help the man with the menu because it is so large. The joke is clever because it is a play on the similar-sounding words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the menu is extremely large, the waiter is still offering more options to the customer. The sommelier is the equivalent of a wine expert, and the joke is that they could go over the wine list with the customer if they want, even though it's not explicitly listed on the menu. This joke plays on the idea that restaurants often have a lot of options that can be overwhelming to customers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. A sommelier is someone who is trained in wine and can help you choose a good wine to drink with your meal. In this case, the waiter is suggesting that instead of looking at the menu, the customer can have the sommelier (wine expert) bring over the wine list. This is a clever way of saying that the customer can choose any wine because the wine list is very long.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the menu is so big that it's taking up the entire table. The man is probably having a hard time finding what he wants on the menu, and the waiter is offering to help by getting the wine list, which is probably also very big.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the menu is so huge that it's laughable to think that the wine list would be just as big. The sommelier is the wine expert at a restaurant, so the waiter's suggestion is that if the man wants help picking a wine, he can ask the sommelier for assistance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is so large that he needs the waiter to bring over the wine list so he can look at it. However, the word "sommelier" is usually used to refer to someone who is knowledgeable about wine, not someone who drags something over. The joke is clever because it uses the two meanings of the word "sommelier" to create a pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is reading the menu, which is already a list, so the waiter's offer to have the sommelier drag over the wine list is redundant. The redundancy is humorous because it's unnecessary and superfluous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is looking at a menu that is so large, it's larger than the table. The waiter's suggestion of bringing over the wine list is sarcastic, because it's not likely that the man will be able to find what he wants on such a large menu.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. A sommelier is a type of waiter who specializes in wine; the joke is that the waiter could fetch not just the wine list, but the entire sommelier, to help the man pick out a wine. Of course, this would be far more trouble than simply fetching the wine list, so the joke is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter's comment is sarcastic. The sommelier is the wine expert at the restaurant, and so the waiter is suggesting that the man ask for the wine list from the sommelier because it's just as large as the menu he's already trying to get through. This is funny because it's a jab at the man's lack of decisiveness and the large size of the menu.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="133.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="135.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
