This joke is poking fun at the ridiculousness of some some jobs that people have to do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it suggests that the man's job is so secret that he has to wear a disguise even in his own home. This is ironic because, while most people's jobs require them to dress a certain way when they leave the house, very few people's jobs are so secretive that they can't even tell their spouses what they do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected that the man's boss would be at the C.I.A. (Central Intelligence Agency). It's even funnier because the man is dressed as a tree trunk, which suggests that he may be in some sort of disguise. Thus, the joke implies that not only is the man's boss at the C.I.A., but also that his boss may be in disguise, which is even more unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the husband's new job is with the Central Intelligence Agency, which is a real thing. But the joke is also funny because the husband is dressed up as a tree trunk, which is not something you would expect a C.I.A. agent to be wearing. The joke is playing on the idea that C.I.A. agents are supposed to be covert and undercover, but the man in the tree trunk is not very covert or undercover.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the wife is casually asking the husband about his new job, not knowing or recognizing that he is in disguise and working for the C.I.A. The joke could be funnier if the husband is a little flustered in trying to come up with an answer on the spot.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the wife is talking to her husband as if he has a normal job, when in reality, he is going to work dressed up in a tree trunk. The contrast between the banal conversation and the unusual situation is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's husband is dressed as a tree trunk, which is not the typical apparel for someone who works at the Central Intelligence Agency. It's possible that the man is in disguise as part of his job, but it's more likely that he's just randomly dressed as a tree. Either way, the joke works because it's unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the husband is clearly not happy with his new boss. The fact that he is dressed up as a tree stump is a visual indication that he is not happy with his new job, which is likely with the C.I.A. The joke is clever because it is a pun on the word "boss": in this context, "boss" can refer to both the man's actual boss at the C.I.A., as well as the fact that the husband is dressed up as a tree, which is technically the "boss" of the trunk.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the husband is wearing a tree trunk, which would normally be found in a forest (or perhaps as part of landscaping). However, the fact that he is also carrying a briefcase implies that he is going to work, specifically for the Central Intelligence Agency, which is a government organization. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the husband's boss is at the "C.I.A.," but the joke implies that his boss is actually a tree.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is going to work at the C.I.A. (Central Intelligence Agency) dressed as a tree. The C.I.A. is a serious organization, and the fact that he is dressed in a silly and non-professional outfit suggests that he is not taking his job seriously. His wife's casual question also implies that this is not the first time he has done this and she is used to it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman asks the man how his new boss at the C.I.A. is, not realizing that her husband's job is not with the Central Intelligence Agency, but rather, he is simply a tree. The contrast between the high-stakes job of being a C.I.A. agent and the reality of the man's job as a tree is what makes the joke humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the trunked man's wife casually asks him about his new boss, as if it's normal for him to go to work for the CIA dressed as a tree. The joke is humorous because it's a play on the fact that, often, people's spouses or family members don't know what exactly their job is, or the details of their work.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's Profession is unexpectedly revealed to be something other than what it appears to be at first. The contrast between the man's seeming mundane job and his actual exciting job as a spy is humorously ironic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because while the woman is reading the newspaper and sending her husband off to work, she casually mentions his new boss at the C.I.A. However, the man's outfitchoice makes it clear that he doesn't work at the C.I.A., which is a government organization. Thus, the joke is funny because the woman is mistakenly thinking her husband works at the C.I.A. when he actually doesn't.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it's perfectly normal for a woman to ask her husband how his new boss is doing, the context of the joke makes it seem like the husband's new boss at the CIA is a tree stump. The contrast between the mundane question and the absurd answer is what makes it funny.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="237.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="239.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
