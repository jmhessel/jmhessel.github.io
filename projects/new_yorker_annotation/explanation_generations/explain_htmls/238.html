The joke is also funny because it's a pun on the phrase "he doesn't know shit from Shinola", meaning he is ignorant about a topic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "he knows nothing about pants" can mean either that the snowman is unfamiliar with the clothing item known as pants, or that the snowman is not wearing any pants. The double-meaning is humorous because it is unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "he knows nothing about women". The woman on the left is angry because she feels that the snowman on the right, who is a man, knows nothing about women. However, because the snowman is, in fact, a snowman, he knows nothing about pants, which is a clothing item typically worn by men. The contrast between the phrase and the reality of the situation is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common saying "he knows nothing about XYZ", where XYZ is some topic the person is not knowledgeable about. In this case, the joke is that the snowman is shopping for pants, but because he is a snowman, he literally knows nothing about pants. This is a silly pun that is funny because it is unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snowman is an inanimate object, so of course he would know nothing about pants. The joke is also a play on words, because the phrase "he doesn't know squat about pants" is often used to mean that someone is uninformed or unqualified. In this case, the snowman literally doesn't know squat about pants, because he's a snowman.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snowman cannot wear pants, because he would melt if he did. However, the fact that he is working in a clothing store implies that he should know a lot about pants. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: "pants" can mean both trousers and information. Thus, the snowman doesn't know anything about trousers (he can't wear them) but he also doesn't know anything about information (he's a snowman).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snowman is dressed in a suit and tie, which implies that he is a professional. However, he is also wearing no pants, which is a sign of disrespect in most professional settings. The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "he doesn't know anything about pants," meaning he doesn't know anything, and the word "pants" being another word for "trousers."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snowman is wearing a pair of pants, but as a snowman, he would not have any need for or knowledge of pants. The joke relies on the incongruity of a snowman wearing pants in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "pants" can mean two things: 1) a type of clothing worn on the lower half of the body or 2) an expression meaning "nonsense." In this case, the snowman is shopping for clothing, so the first definition applies. However, the co-worker's comment that the snowman "knows nothing about pants" is also a comment on the snowman's intelligence, implying that the snowman is dumb and that the co-worker doesn't believe anything the snowman says, i.e., that it's all "pants."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "he knows nothing about women". The woman on the left is angry because the snowman on the right is trying to help sort through the inventory, but doesn't know anything about pants (or, more generally, clothing). The woman is mad because the snowman is inexperience and is wasting her time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snowman is buying pants, but as an inanimate object, he would not have any expertise in choosing the right pants. The joke is also funny because it playfully imagines the conversation the two co-workers might have about the snowman: one co-worker might be trying to convince the other that the snowman is a clueless customer, while the other co-worker is more savvy about the fact that the snowman is not a real person.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snowman cannot wear pants, because he would melts and his lower half would fall off. However, the other woman in the store is wearing pants, which demonstrates that she has a better understanding of clothing than the snowman. The joke is also a play on the phrase "he knows nothing," meaning that the snowman is uninformed or ignorant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is a snowman, and thus would not have any need for pants. The fact that he is shopping in a clothing store, specifically for pants, is absurd and humorous. The joke is also clever because it plays on the double-meaning of the word "pants": in this context, "pants" refers to clothing, but it can also mean "underwear". So the joke could also be interpreted as the snowman not knowing anything about underwear, which would make sense given that he is a snowman and would not have any need for it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the snowman doesn't know anything about "pants" (trousers), but the other characters in the store think he is talking about a different type of pants, undergarments. This misunderstanding is funny because it's a common type of misunderstanding that can happen in real life, but it's made funnier because of the unusual situation of a snowman shopping in a store.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "he knows nothing about women", which is often used to describe someone who is clueless when it comes to interacting with the opposite sex. In this case, the snowman is clueless when it comes to sorting through pants, because he doesn't have any himself. The fact that he is a snowman is what makes this joke funny, because it's unexpected and surreal.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="237.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="239.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
