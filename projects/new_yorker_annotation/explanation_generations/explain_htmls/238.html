Next week we'll work on your fear of Morse code.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist's comment is non sequitur. The man's fear of Morse code has nothing to do with his standing on the couch or holding up flags; the therapist has just randomly brought up another topic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's fear of Morse code is an entirely irrational fear to have, and it's made even funnier by the fact that he's Scottish, and Scotland is not known for using Morse code. The therapist's casual response to the man's fear also makes the joke funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the therapist's casual response to the man's serious problem and the man's over-the-top reaction. The man is clearly afraid of something, but it's not clear what, and the therapist's nonchalant response suggests that she doesn't think it's a big deal. The flags he's holding up could be a reference to the Scottish flag, and the fact that he's afraid of Morse code could be a play on the fact that Scotland is often associated with kilts.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="237.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="239.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
