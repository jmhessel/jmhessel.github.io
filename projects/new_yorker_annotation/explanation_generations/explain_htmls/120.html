The fact that the ball is in a pool also makes it funnier because it's an unexpected place to find a beach ball.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the huge size of the beach ball and the small size of the people in the pool. It would be impossible for someone to catch the beach ball, and yet, one of the people in the pool said that they would try to catch it. The last that was heard from that person was them saying that they would try to catch the ball, which implies that they were unsuccessful.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "catch it" can mean two things: to stop the ball from going into the water, or to catch the disease that the ball is probably covered in. In this case, the person who said they would catch it probably caught the disease, given the size of the ball and the number of people around it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The pool is filled with a beach ball, and the people are presumably playing with it. The joke is that the person who said they would "catch it" was referring to the beach ball, but they were presumably caught by the ball themselves and are now trapped underneath it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The beach ball is so large that it's blocking the view of the person who was swimming in the pool. Therefore, the person who yelled "I'll catch it" probably won't be able to because they can't see it. This is a play on the phrase "I'll church it", which means to hit a ball so that it goes out of bounds.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the beach ball is so big that it probably couldn't be caught by anyone. The speaker implies that they were the last person to try, and they haven't been seen since. This joke plays on the idea that people sometimes overestimate their ability to handle a situation, and end up getting themselves into trouble.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The pool is filled with a beach ball, and "I'll catch it" are the last words the speaker heard. This is because the person who said they would catch the ball got smashed by the ball and presumably died. So, the person hearing the story only knows what happened because they were the last person to hear the speaker's words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "I'll catch it," is both a declaration of intent to catch the beach ball, but it's also a phrase meaning "I understand," which is what the person who said it probably meant. However, the fact that the pool is so full of beach balls makes it difficult to catch the one that was tossed, and thus the person's intentions are contradicted.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in order for the pool to be filled with the giant beach ball, somebody must have put it there. But the person who put it there is nowhere to be found, and the pool is now unusable because it's full of the giant beach ball. The people around the pool are now stuck there because they can't get in the pool. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the person who said they would catch the ball was referring to catching the ball when it was thrown to them, but instead they caught the ball in the sense of being the one responsible for it being there.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who said they would catch the ball is probably not going to be able to. The beach ball is so big that it would be difficult for one person to catch it; it would likely take multiple people. The person who said they would catch it is likely to be overwhelmed and unable to do so.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the pool is filled with water, and the beach ball is in the water. The people around the pool are presumably waiting for someone to come and get the ball out of the water. The person who said they would catch the ball is presumably going to go into the water to get it, but they haven't yet. The joke is that they may have drowned, since they haven't come back up.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the swimmers has called out to the other to catch a beach ball that's currently floating in the pool. The other person, presumably not wanting to get their hair wet, decided to leave instead. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the person called out to catch the ball, but instead caught the person leaving.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people in the scene are probably expecting someone to say "I'll get the beach ball out of the pool," but instead, the person who was tasked with getting the ball says that he'll catch it. This is a pun on the fact that the word "catch" can mean to remove something from a pool (in this case, the beach ball), or to intercept and stop something (in this case, the ball as it's falling).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker implies that the person who said they would catch the ball is now dead, because the ball is so huge. The speaker is also implying that the ball is going to fall into the pool and crush whoever is underneath it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the beach ball is so big that it's impossible to catch. The person who said they would catch it probably got swept away by the ball when it started moving.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="119.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="121.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
