However, because the Grim Reaper is, well, Death, it's not clear what exactly his "priors" would be, and the lawyer's statement is actually rather meaningless.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in this context, the term "priors" refers to a person's previous criminal convictions, but the Grim Reaper doesn't have a criminal record because, well, he's the Grim Reaper. So, the lawyer is telling the Grim Reaper that his "priors" are going to be a problem, even though he doesn't have any.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the Grim Reaper is technically dead, he has "priors" in the sense that he has killed many people. Therefore, the lawyer's statement is both a pun on the Reaper's occupation, and a warning that his occupation will make it difficult to get a fair trial.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the grim reaper is, of course, going to have a lot of prior convictions (for killing people). However, in this context, "priors" can also refer to the fact that the person has died before, which is also technically true for the grim reaper. The double-meaning makes the joke funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the grim reaper, who is death personified, is talking to his lawyer about his priors. The joke is clever because, technically, death cannot have priors because he cannot be tried for a crime --- he is above the law.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in the context of a court of law, the fact that the accused is the personification of death means that he is not subject to the law in the same way that mortals are. This irony is juxtaposed with the lawyer's comment about the accused's "priors," which in the context of the courtroom would typically refer to a criminal's past offenses, but in this case refers to the fact that the accused has, in the past, caused death.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lawyer is telling the grim reaper that his "priors" are going to be a problem. "Priors" usually refers to somebody's criminal record, but death is not a crime. In addition, the grim reaper is not subject to the laws of man, so even if he did have a criminal record, it would not be relevant in this situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the grim reaper is being accused of a crime, and his lawyer is telling him that his "priors" (previous crimes) will be a problem. However, the grim reaper is Death personified, and thus can't die, meaning that he can't be tried or convicted of any crime.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the Grim Reaper is clearly dead, he is still subject to the same constraints as living people in a court of law. In other words, the Grim Reaper can be charged with a crime and his prior record will be taken into account, just like it would be for anyone else. This is a play on the phrase "your prior record will be taken into account", which is usually said in a negative context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lawyer is telling the Grim Reaper that his "priors," or past actions, are going to be a problem. This is a play on words because the Grim Reaper's job is to collect souls, which can be seen as a type of "prior."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the grim reaper is technically not a living person and therefore cannot be tried in court, he clearly has a history of, well, reaping people. Therefore, his lawyer is telling him that his "priors" (a colloquialism for prior convictions), in this case, are going to be a problem in court. The joke is clever because it plays on the idea of the Grim Reaper as an unstoppable force: even he can be brought to court and have his actions scrutinized.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of the Grim Reaper being on trial, the term "priors" refers to criminal offenses that the Reaper has committed in the past. However, "priors" could also refer to the fact that the Grim Reaper is, well, the Grim Reaper: his job is to, essentially, killing people. Therefore, the Grim Reaper's occupation could be seen as a criminal offense, which is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Grim Reaper, who is personification of death, is being told by a lawyer that his priors are going to be a problem. In other words, the lawyer is telling him that his history of killing people is going to be a problem in this particular court case. The irony is that the Grim Reaper doesn't usually have to worry about such things, since he is, well, death.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lawyer is trying to explain to the Grim Reaper that, even though he is technically innocent of the charges against him, the Grim Reaper's past actions will be held against him in court. This is ironic because, as the personification of death, the Grim Reaper is supposed to be beyond the reach of the law.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the grim reaper, who isDeath personified, is being counseled by a lawyer. The lawyer is telling him that his priors, or past actions, will be a problem in court. This is ironic because the grim reaper is, by definition, the end of life, and so his past is moot.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="29.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="31.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
