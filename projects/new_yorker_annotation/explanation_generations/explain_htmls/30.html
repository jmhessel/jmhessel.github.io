She's angry at him not for hiring a professional to do the job, but for not being good at it himself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the wife is angry at the husband for destroying the living room with his amateurish pistol skills. The wife is telling him that he should have hired a professional to do whatever it is he was trying to do, whether that be Shoot the gun or destroy the living room. In either case, the husband's lack of expertise has led to him making a mess.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is berating her husband for not hiring a professional to do the job properly, i.e., to kill himself. This is ironic because, usually, when someone hires a professional, it is for a good reason, like they are qualified to do the job. However, in this case, it would have been better if the husband had not hired a professional, because then he would not have botched his suicide attempt.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is angry at the man for ruining the room and not being able to shoot himself properly. The man is telling her that she should have hired a professional to do the job, implying that he is not good at shooting himself. This is a play on the phrase "I told you so," which is often used after something goes wrong to say that the person should have listened to the speaker's advice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually when someone hires a professional, they are looking for someone who is an expert in their field to do a job. In this case, the woman hired a professional to destroy their living room --- probably because she was tired of the man making a mess of things. The joke is that the man is now about to kill himself, and the woman is pointing out that she told him to hire a professional to do the job properly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is angry at the man for hiring an amateur to destroy the room, when she clearly wanted a professional to do a better job. The contrast between the woman's expectations and the man's incompetence is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is angry at the man because he ruined the room, and she told him to hire a professional to help him clean up the mess. However, the man has a gun pointed at his head, which suggests that he was the one who hire a professional --- a hitman, specifically. So, the woman's statement is sarcastic because the man clearly did not hire a professional to help him clean up the mess, but instead made it worse by hiring a professional to kill him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has clearly not succeeded in killing himself, despite having a gun pointed to his head. This is either because he is terrible at aiming, or because he is using a gun that doesn't fire correctly. In either case, his wife is scolding him because he should have hire a professional to do the job correctly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the wife is telling her husband that he should have hired a professional to do whatever it is he was trying to do in the house. The husband's response is to point the gun at his own head, as if to say "I am a professional" --- in other words, he is professional at causing destruction.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is angry at the man for destroying the room and she tells him that he should have hired a professional. She is saying this because she thinks that he is not good at shooting guns, and that is why everything is broken. However, the man is actually a professional, and he is only pretending to be bad at shooting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the husband is scolding his wife for not hiring a professional to do something, and the something is revealed to be him shooting himself. This is a dark joke that playfully relies on the taboo nature of suicide.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because even though the man has a gun in his hand, he is clearly not a professional. The joke implying that had he just hired someone to do the job, the result would have been less of a mess.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a parody of a famous scene from the movie "The Godfather," in which a man is threatened by a mobster who is holding a gun to his head. In the movie, the man is ordered to kill someone and is told to hire a professional; in this joke, the man is being told to hire a professional to clean up the mess he made, presumably because he is too incompetent to do it himself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is scolding her husband for not hiring a professional to do the job (of killing himself) properly. This is a play on words because "hiring a professional" usually refers to paying someone to do a job that laymen would find difficult (like, e.g., fixing a sink), whereas in this case, the husband is being admonished for not hiring someone to kill himself properly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is amateurishly trying to shoot himself in the head, but is doing a very poor job of it. The woman is telling him that he should have just hired a professional to do it instead, emphasizing how incompetent he is.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
