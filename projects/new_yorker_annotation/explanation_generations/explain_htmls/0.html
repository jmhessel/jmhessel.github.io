We should have requested a fiddler on the roof.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the piano is so large that it caved in their house. The joke is a play on the phrase "a fiddler on the roof", which is often used to describe a situation where someone is in danger of being crushed. In this case, the person was right to be worried about the piano, but if they had requested a fiddler on the roof, they might have avoided the destruction.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the reference to the musical "Fiddler on the Roof", in which a fiddler plays music on the roof of a house. In this situation, the piano has crushed the house, and the man remarks that if they had only requested a fiddler on the roof, this could have been avoided.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the piano dropping from the sky and destroying the house is such an improbable event, and yet, it happened. The man and woman in the house were probably arguing about something before the piano fell, and the woman was right that they should have had a fiddler on the roof. The fiddler on the roof is a symbol of good luck, and in this case, it would have been good luck that would have prevented the piano from falling and destroying their house.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple's house has been destroyed by a piano, and the husband is making a pun about how they should have had a fiddler on the roof.

The phrase "fiddler on the roof" is often used to describe someone who is playing music on the roof of a building. In this case, the person is suggesting that they should have had someone playing music on the roof to warn them about the giant piano falling on their house.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the giant piano has crushed the house, and the people are now regretting not having hired a musician to play on the roof. If they had, the musician would have been out of the way of the piano, and the house would not have been damaged.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "piano" and the phrase "fiddler on the roof" are both homonyms, meaning they are pronounced the same but have different meanings. In this joke, the couple wishes they had requested a fiddler on the roof, a musician who plays the violin, rather than a piano, because then their house would still be standing. This is a clever way of pointing out that the piano was the cause of their destroyed house.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it references the musical "Fiddler on the Roof", in which a poor family living in a house on the brink of collapse dreams of having a wealthy life. In this situation, the piano has already collapsed their house, so the joke is that they should have requested a fiddler on the roof beforehand.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is making a pun on the fact that they wished they had a "fiddler on the roof" (someone who plays music on the roof of a building) to warn them of the impending danger, instead of the more traditional "piano."
