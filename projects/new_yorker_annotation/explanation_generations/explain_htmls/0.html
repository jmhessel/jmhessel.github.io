One day your portrait will be used as the symbol of a political party even more primitive than we are.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a jab at a current or past political party that is considered to be behind the times or "primitive." The joke is clever because it not only makes a political point, but also speaks to the progress of civilization, from cavemen to the modern day.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the comparison between the caveman's society and modern-day society. The caveman's society is represented as being very primitive, and yet even they are more advanced than the modern-day political party that the caveman's portrait is being used for. The joke is clever because it is a clever play on words: the caveman's painting will be used as the symbol of a party that is "even more primitive than we are," which is a clever way of saying that the party is very backwards and old-fashioned.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "trust me" is often used by people in positions of authority to convince others to believe them, even if what they're saying isn't true. In this case, the caveman is telling the mammoth that he trusts him, even though the caveman is the one who is actually painting the portrait. The joke is also a jab at how political parties often use primitive symbols (like a caveman or a mammoth) to represent their views.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity between the highly-evolved political parties of today and the more primitive cavemen. The joke is also funny because it's a self-deprecating comment on the caveman's own party.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the juxtaposition of the relatively advanced civilization of the caveman with the political parties of today. While the caveman is painting a Mammoth, which seems very primitive, the fact is that the caveman is actually part of a more advanced civilization than the political parties of today. The irony is that the caveman's painting will one day be seen as more sophisticated than the current political parties.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The caveman is drawing a portrait of the elephant, and the elephant is standing by as a model. The joke is that the caveman is saying that one day, the picture will be used as a symbol for a political party that is even more primitive than they are. This is funny because it's a play on the fact that elephants are often used as symbols for the Republican Party in the United States.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the caveman's angry expression and the fact that he is painting the mammoth. The joke is also funny because it is a political commentary on how current political parties are perceived as being more primitive than cavemen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the irony of the caveman's situation: he is drawing an elephant, which will eventually become a symbol for the Republican Party (an elephant is the mascot for the Republican Party). The caveman thinks he's making a portrait of the elephant, but in reality, he's creating a hieroglyph that will be used thousands of years in the future to represent a political party.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the idea that history repeats itself. The caveman is saying that even though they are currently the most primitive people around, there will one day be a political party that is even more primitive, and their portrait will be used as the symbol of that party.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is predicting that the elephant will one day be used as a symbol for a political party. The joke is clever because it's not only a play on words (the word "primitive" can describe both the elephant and the political party), but it's also a reference to the fact that elephants are often used as symbols for the Republican Party in the United States.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In one sense, the caveman is saying that the mammoth will be remembered long after he's gone, and that he'll be an important symbol. However, the word "primitive" can also be used to describe something that is simple or not evolved, and in that sense, the caveman is saying that the mammoth will be remembered as a symbol of a political party that is not as evolved as they are.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a dig at the expense of political parties. The fact that the caveman's painting will be used as a symbol for a political party shows how little things have changed in the political landscape. Additionally, the fact that the caveman is painting the mammoth makes the joke even funnier, because it is an absurd situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Portrait" can mean either a painting or a photograph of a person, but it can also be a symbol that represents a person or group. In this case, the caveman is saying that the picture he's drawing will become a primitive symbol for a political party.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Primitive" can mean both "not advanced" and "the FIRST." So the joke is suggesting that, even though the caveman is currently much more primitive than the people who will eventually use his painting as their party's symbol, he was actually the FIRST one to be primitive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the Democratic Party's use of the donkey as their symbol. The caveman's Drawing of an elephant is being used as a symbol for a political party, which the caveman jokes is more primitive than their own. This is funny because it's a subtle jab at the Democratic Party.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
