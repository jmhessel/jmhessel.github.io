In this scenario, the police officer is going to "let the caveman off" with a warning, meaning that he won't give him a ticket. However, the caveman literally has no history, because he is a caveman, and therefore the police officer can't give him a ticket for speeding because he has no record.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because getting a speeding ticket is a common occurrence, but getting a speeding ticket for riding on a prehistoric, non-motorized vehicle is quite rare. The police officer is clearly bemused by the situation, and so he decides to let the caveman off with a warning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police officer is pretending that the caveman has a clean driving record, despite the fact that he was caught speeding on a carved stone wheel. The officer is doing this because he knows that it would be very difficult for the caveman to have a clean driving record given the lack of motorized transportation in his time period.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The police officer says he's going to let the caveman "off" with a warning, but "off" can also mean "to kill." So, the officer is saying that he's going to let the caveman go free, but also implying that he could kill him if he wanted to.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police officer is being very lenient with the caveman, despite the fact that he was caught speeding. The reason for the leniency is that the caveman has no prior history, which is a common reason for someone to get a reduced sentence. However, in this case, the lack of prior history is due to the fact that the caveman is from the stone age and thus has no history of speeding (or, really, of anything).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The police officer is warning the caveman not to speed again, but he's also literal warning him about the dangers of something (in this case, a speeding stone wheel). This is a clever way to get around the fact that the caveman probably doesn't have a driver's license or any way to operate a motor vehicle.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the officer is giving the caveman a break even though he was speeding. The officer is probably aware that it is not possible for the caveman to have a prior history, given that he is a caveman. The officer is showing leniency because he assumes that the caveman is not aware of the speeding laws.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The police officer is warning the caveman not to speed, but since the caveman has no prior history, the police officer is also saying that the caveman has no record. The double meaning of the phrase is what makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The police officer says he's going to let the caveman "off" with a warning, which could mean either (1) stop giving him a ticket/letting him go free, or (2) get off of the stone wheel. The second meaning is humorous because the caveman would have had to slow down and get off the wheel in order to receive the ticket in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is being given a speeding ticket for something that he presumably doesn't even know is a law. The officer is being lenient and giving him a warning because he has no history, but the joke is that the caveman won't even understand the warning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "off with a warning." In this case, the police officer is telling the caveman that he will let him "off" (i.e., allow him to leave) with a warning instead of giving him a ticket. But "off" can also mean "stop" or "cease," as in the phrase "off with his head." So, the police officer is also warning the caveman to stop speeding.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police officer is being lenient with the caveman by giving him a warning instead of a ticket. The joke is clever because it is a play on words --- the phrase "prior history" can refer to whether someone has been caught speeding before, but in this case, it refers to the fact that the caveman is from a time period before written history.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police officer is giving the caveman a break, even though he was speeding. The officer says that he's going to let the caveman off with a warning because he has no prior history, which is a euphemism for "because you're a caveman and you probably don't even know what speeding is."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The police officer is saying that he's going to let the caveman off with a warning because he has no "prior history" of speeding tickets. However, the caveman is literally from the prehistoric era, so of course he has no prior history.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the police officer is being lenient by giving the caveman a warning despite him speeding, the caveman technically has no prior history because he's a caveman and hasn't been around long enough to develop a history.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="50.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="52.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
