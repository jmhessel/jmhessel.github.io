The boss is the only one who is not affected by the slanted room, meaning that he is the only one who is not at a disadvantage. The rest of the employees are in the corner, meaning that they are powerless and at a disadvantage. The boss's statement, "Welcome to orientation," is a play on words because it can be interpreted as both a welcome to the company and a welcome to the slanted room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in a business setting, "orientation" is usually a meeting where new employees are given information about the company, their job duties, etc. In this case, because the room is slanted and everyone is in the corner except for the boss, the boss's statement takes on a new meaning: the employees are literally oriented, or positioned, in the corner of the room. The joke is clever because it's a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the new hires are in a orientation meeting, being introduced to the company. However, the room they are in is so slanted that they are all crammed into the corner, which is a far from ideal way to spend an orientation meeting. The joke is clever because it pokes fun at the fact that many orientation meetings are long and boring, and new employees often feel like they are just being "oriented" to the company without learning anything useful.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="50.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="52.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
