The pipe organ is usually played in the key of C major, but in this instance, it has been transposed to the key of Fahrenheit, which is a unit of measurement for temperature. This is a clever way of saying that the pipe organ has been turned into a radiator, which emits heat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the huge size of the organ pipes is disproportionate to what would be needed for an organ in a church. The person seated at the organ is playing it as if it were a regular-sized organ, which leads to the joke about how he had to retune it to a different key because of the different size.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a radiator doesn't usually have anything to do with music, let alone being used as an instrument in a church. In this case, the radiator is so big that it looks like a pipe organ, and the joke is that the man playing it had to make a musical transcription to accommodate the fact that it is a radiator and not an organ. This is clever because it is a play on words (transposing from one key to another) and also because it is a pun on the fact that radiators use a different scale to measure temperature (Fahrenheit) than organs do (C major).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "transpose" can mean to change the pitch of a note in music, or to change the key of a piece of music. In this case, the joke is that the persontransposed from playing the organ in C major to playing the organ in Fahrenheit, which is a measure of temperature. This is funny because it is an impossible feat, and also because it mixes two unrelated concepts.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the priest is talking about how difficult it was to convert the musical scale of C major to the temperature scale of Fahrenheit. This is difficult because the two scales are completely unrelated; one is a measure of temperature and the other is a measure of pitch.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. Transposing in music means to take a piece of music written in one key and play it in another key. The joke is that instead of transposing the music from C major to another musical key, the person playing the organ transposed it from the Celsius temperature scale to the Fahrenheit temperature scale. This is a way of saying that the person playing the organ is very smart, because transposing music is difficult, and transposing from one temperature scale to another is also difficult.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that "C major" and "Fahrenheit" both use the letter "F" as their starting note. In music, a C major scale has no "F" note in it, while a Fahrenheit scale does. Therefore, the joke is that the church official had to change the starting note of the organ from "C major" to "Fahrenheit" in order to make it work.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "transposing" can mean either to change the key of a piece of music, or to convert from one system of measurement to another. In this case, the church official has transposed the music from C major to Fahrenheit, which is a very different key, and a very different type of measurement.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words --- the organ is usually played in the key of C major, but in this case, it has been transposed to the temperature scale, i.e., played in the key of Fahrenheit. This is a clever way of saying that the organist was very hot, probably because of the huge radiator fins behind him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Transposing" can mean either to change the pitch of a note (in music), or to change the scale of a temperature (in physics/math). In this situation, the organist has presumably changed the pitch of the note, but the other man comments that it was just as hard as if he had changed the temperature scale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because playing an instrument in a different key is a difficult task for most musicians. Transposing from C major to Fahrenheit would be an even more difficult task, because one is a musical key and the other is a temperature scale. The joke is a play on words, substituting the word "key" for the word "Fahrenheit."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man playing the organ has been playing so hard that the heat from his playing has warmed up the radiator, which is usually used to heat a room. The man has thus effectively turned the radiator into an organ, by playing it so that it emits sound. The joke is also a play on words, because "Fahrenheit" is a type of scale used to measure temperature, and thus the man has effectively transposed the music from one scale to another.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The church official is talking about how hard it was to play the organ, but the word "transposing" can also mean to convert from one scale to another. In this case, the second meaning of transposing is what is relevant: the hard part wasn't playing the organ, it was converting from the C major scale to the Fahrenheit scale, which is a much harder task.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The hard part wasn't transposing from C major to Fahrenheit, it was transposing from Fa - a key on a pipe organ - to Fahrenheit, which is a measure of temperature. The joke is clever because it's a pun that only works if you know that C major and Fa are both keys on a piano.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the word "transpose." In music, transposing means to change the key of a piece of music. However, in this context, the word "transpose" is used to mean changing from one scale to another. The joke is humorous because the church official is talking about changing the organ from playing in the key of C major to the temperature in Fahrenheit.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="50.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="52.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
