The deer are looking at deer crossing signs, but the word "deer" can also mean "to fear or be afraid of". So, the deer are looking at the signs and saying that they are afraid of crossing the road. This is a play on the fact that deer are often hit by cars because they are afraid to cross the road.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because deer are often associated with crossing signs, since they frequently dart out into the road and cause car accidents. The joke implies that the deer are vain and think that the crossing signs are portraits of them, which is amusing because it's not true.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer sees himself in the road signs because they are literal signs of deer. In other words, the deer is recognizing himself in the art because the art is representational of him and his species. This is a humorous play on the idea that people often see themselves reflected in art.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common saying "I see myself in his work" which is usually meant figuratively. In this case, the deer are literally seeing themselves in the work, because the road signs are of deer crossings. The joke is also clever because it's a play on words: the phrase "I see myself in his work" can also be interpreted to mean "I understand his work," which is appropriate in this context as well, since the deer are understanding the road signs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are looking at paintings of deer crossing signs. Because the deer are looking at the paintings, they are seeing themselves in the work, which is a play on the phrase "I see myself in you" which is often used to describe a deep connection with another person.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are looking at signs that have pictures of deer on them, and one of the deer says that he sees himself in the artist's work. This is funny because it's a play on words: the deer sees himself in the work, but the deer is also literally part of the work, since he's on the sign.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are looking at deer crossing signs, which are meant for, well, deer crossing the road. The joke can be interpreted in two ways: either the deer are so naively confused about the meaning of the sign that they think it is a painting of themselves, or, more likely, the deer are Butts (pun intended) and are making a self-deprecating joke about how they see themselves in the signs because they have to cross the road so often. In either case, the joke is clever and funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are looking at a deer crossing sign, and the sign is of a deer walking upright. The joke is that the deer see themselves in the sign, because it is a deer walking upright, just like they are. The deer are confused because they don't know why the sign is there, but the joke is that it is there for them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The deer are looking at deer crossing signs, and the joke is that they see themselves in the signs. The signs are meant for deer to avoid being hit by cars, but the deer see themselves as the ones crossing the road. The joke is clever because it is a play on the words "deer" and "dear".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The deer are literally seeing themselves in the road signs, as the signs are pictures of deer. But, the deer can also be interpreted as people who see themselves reflected in the artist's work. This second meaning is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are looking at road signs that feature deer crossing, and one of the deer comments on how he can see himself in the signs. The joke is clever because it play on the double meaning of "seeing yourself in something": the deer can see himself because he is literally seeing his own reflection, but he is also seeing himself in a figurative sense, in that he finds aspects of himself in the signs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because deer can't appreciate art, and so they would only see themselves in the work if it was a literal depiction of a deer. But of course, most deer signs are just pictures of deer crossing signs, which don't really look like deer. So the deer would only see themselves in the work if they were very stupid or if they were looking at a sign that said "deer crossing" instead of an actual piece of art.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The deer are looking at road signs, which are usually written in English. However, the deer are seeing themselves in the signs, because the signs are literally shaped like deer. Therefore, the deer are appreciating the signs in a way that humans normally wouldn't.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="185.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="187.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
