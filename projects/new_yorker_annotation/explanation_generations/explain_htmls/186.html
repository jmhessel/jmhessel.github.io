The grand jury is ask the person on trial to come "in" to the courtroom, but the person has already escaped, so they are left with just the person's empty suit. The joke is that the grand jury is asking the suit itself to come in, which obviously it cannot do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In a grand jury hearing, the accused is "on the stand", which means they are testifying in front of the jury. However, in this case, the accused is not physically present, so the only thing "on the stand" is the empty suit. The joke is that the grand jury is asking the empty suit what size it is, as if the size of the clothing is relevant to the case. This is absurd, of course, but it's also humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The grand jury is "asking" the empty suit (which represents the evasive person on trial) if it comes in size 42, which is a standard men's clothing size. However, the jury is also "asking" the person on trial if they will be accountable and answer the questions honestly (i.e., "come clean"). The double-meaning of the word "come" is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The grand jury is asking the empty chair, which represents the person who was on trial but has since escaped, if it comes in a size 42, meaning if that is the size of the person who was wearing the suit. This is clever because, even though the person has escaped and is no longer there, the grand jury is still trying to hold them accountable for their actions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The grand jury is asking the empty suit, which is all that's left of the person on trial, if it comes in a size 42. This is a reference to the fact that, in some jurisdictions, a person can be tried in absentia, which means that even if they aren't physically present, the trial can still go on. However, in this case, the person has actually escaped, which is why there's only an empty suit left. The jury's question is funny because it's a play on the fact that the person is actually missing, and not just absent.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The committee is asking the empty suit, which is all that's left of the person being tried, if it comes in size 42. This is amusing because it's a literal interpretation of the question: usually, when a committee asks someone if they come in a certain size, they are asking if the person is available to fill a position on the committee. In this case, the size 42 is likely a reference to a 42-inch waist size, which is comically large.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "to answer for one's crimes." In this instance, the person on trial has literally disappeared, so the jury is asking the empty suit if it comes in a size 42, in other words, if it can fit the person they are looking for. This joke pokes fun at the formality of grand jury hearings and the fact that the person on trial is not there to answer for their crimes.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "to come in peace" or "to come in a friendly manner." In this context, the jury is asking the empty suit if the person who was wearing it (and who is now invisible/not present) comes in a size 42, i.e., if they are willing to surrender or be arrested. The fact that the person has escaped justice by becoming invisible is also humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "committee" is the grand jury, and they are asking the empty suit, which is clearly not a person, if it comes in size 42. This is a way of saying that they are done with the hearing, and that the person who was supposed to be there has now officially become invisible and unaccountable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the target of the hearing is gone and all that is left is an empty suit, the jury is still going through with the proceedings as if the person is still there. The joke is a play on the fact that, even though the target of the hearing is not physically present, they are still required to answer questions and be accountable for their actions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the finding of the grand jury: they will ask the final question, and the answer should be "yes", the person being charged comes in a 42. But, because the person has escaped, they can't answer, and so the jury has to find them "not guilty", even though they may have done something wrong.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the person who is on trial is hiding by using invisibility as their defense, and the only way to determine if they are truly invisible is by measuring them for a new suit. The grand jury is asking the person, through the empty suit, one final time if they are indeed invisible. The joke is clever because it is a play on the word "hearing", which can mean both a legal proceeding, and the act of listening.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The grand jury is asking the empty suit, which presumably used to be worn by the person on trial, one final time if it comes in a size 42. This is a silly question because the suit is just a piece of clothing and doesn't have a size. The jury is asking the question because they want to know where the person on trial has gone; the person has presumably escaped and is now invisible. The jury is hoping that, by asking the size of the empty suit, they will be able to figure out where the person on trial has gone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the jury is asking the empty suit a question that it cannot answer, since it does not have a person in it. The question is also funny because it is an existential one that a person in a suit would not normally be asked. The joke highlights the ridiculousness of the situation, where the jury is trying to hold an invisible person accountable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it mocks the grand jury's questioning of the empty suit by asking it a question that is irrelevant to the case. This is silly because, obviously, the suit cannot answer the question. The joke also plays on the fact that, in a grand jury, the target of the hearing is not actually on trial, and so they are not required to answer questions.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="185.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="187.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
