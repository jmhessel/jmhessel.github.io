I'll always love him. I'm just saying I still think the hospital switched him at birth.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it turns out that the couple's child is a whale, which explains why they were so surprised to find a whale in their car. This is a play on the phrase "I'm not saying I don't love you, I'm just saying the hospital staff probably mixed you up at birth." In this case, the couple still loves their "child," even though he's not human.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idea that couples sometimes joke about how their partner is "the wrong one," meaning that they are not a good match for each other. In this case, the joke is taken to an extreme, with the woman suggesting that her partner is not the same person she fell in love with, but instead is a whale. The joke is also funny because it's absurd and there's no way that the couple could actually be together if the man really was a whale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the woman's love for her husband, even though he is very clearly not human. The joke also casts doubt on the woman's sanity, as she must know that her husband is a whale, and yet she still entertains the possibility that he was switched at birth.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur. The woman in the car is talking about how she still loves her husband, but then completely changes the subject to how she thinks the hospital incorrectly identified her son at birth and switched him with someone else. The joke is funny because it's unexpected and doesn't make sense in the context of the conversation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the woman in the car is not truly in love with her husband, but is instead just deluding herself. This is because she believes that the hospital switched him at birth, which means she is not actually in love with him, but with someone else.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common saying "I love you, but I'm not in love with you." In this case, the woman says she loves her husband, but she still thinks he was switched at birth with the whale. The joke is clever because it's a play on words, and it's also funny because it's a completely absurd situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's declaration of love for her partner is undermined by her belief that he is not really her biological child. The joke is clever because it plays on the double meaning of "switched": both that the hospital may have given her the wrong baby, and that her partner may have been born a different gender than he currently identifies as.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the woman in the car is talking about how much she loves her husband, she's also raising the possibility that he's not actually her husband, but rather a person who was switched at birth in the hospital. It's a dark joke because it's implying that she doesn't really know the person she's married to, but it's also funny because it's a very unlikely scenario.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's impossible for the woman in the car to be in love with the whale in the backseat. It's either a mistake or she's delusional. The joke could also be interpreted as her being in denial about her love for the whale, because she knows it's not possible, but she can't help how she feels.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common relationship issue of one partner feeling like they are not truly loved. In this case, the woman says she loves her husband, but she still thinks the hospital switched him at birth, implying that she doesn't really love him because he's not who she thought he was. The joke is further funny because the husband is a whale, which is not a typical human husband, adding to the idea that the woman doesn't really love him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman driving is talking about how much she loves her husband, but she still thinks that the hospital accidentally gave her the wrong baby. It's unexpected because usually when people talk about how much they love their partner, they don't also say that they think they were given the wrong baby. The joke might also be funny because it's a play on the fact that whales are often called "fish", even though they are mammals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the car is saying that he loves the whale (likely because it's a very large and majestic creature), but he still thinks that the hospital mixed up the whale with another baby at birth. This is silly, of course, because whales and humans are not the same species.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that the woman in the car would never be able to have a whale as a child, because they are not able to survive outside of water, so the only way she could have a whale as a child is if the hospital switched him at birth, which is a highly unlikely event.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman in the car is talking about how much she loves her husband, but the whale behind the car makes it sound like she's talking about the whale. This is ironic because, while she may always love her husband, the whale is not her husband and she shouldn't love it in the same way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's impossible for a whale to be on a road. The only explanation is that the hospital mixed up the whale with a human baby at birth, and the woman in the car is admitting that she's still not over the hospital's mistake.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="157.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="159.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
