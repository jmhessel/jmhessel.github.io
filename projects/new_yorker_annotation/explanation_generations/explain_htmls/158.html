The book people are surrounding the two people, and the word "literally" is usually used to emphasize the true meaning of a statement. In this case, the word "literally" is used to emphasize the fact that the book people are actually surrounding them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is being literal when they say they're surrounded: they are, in fact, completely surrounded by books. The joke would not be as funny if they were surrounded by any other inanimate objects because books, due to their anthropomorphized representation in children's stories, are often seen as having human-like qualities.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the situation is unusual (there are book people in this world), the people who are surrounded by them are not in any danger. The joke is a play on the fact that the word "literally" is often misused, and in this case, it is being used correctly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The couple is surrounded by large books, and they are also literally surrounded, i.e., the books are on all sides of them. But, the pun only works if you say "we're literally surrounded" rather than "we're surrounded by books" --- if you say the latter, it's not as funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The couple is surrounded by books, and the largest book is being very menacing. The couple is scared and the man says that they are "literally surrounded". The word "literally" is often used incorrectly, but in this case it is used correctly, as the couple is actually surrounded by books.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is using the word "literally" to describe their current situation in a way that is not actually literal: they are not actually surrounded by anything, let alone by angry books. The angry books are actually people who are disguised as books, and they are angry at the couple because the couple is literate and the books are not.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The couple is surrounded by large books, and the man says they are "literally surrounded". This is funny because, while they are surrounded by physical objects, the books are not actually alive and so they cannot be said to be "literally" surrounding the couple.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "we're surrounded." The couple is actually surrounded by books, which is not normally considered a dangerous situation. However, the books are angry and human-sized, so the couple is in a dangerous situation. The joke is funny because it's a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The couple is surrounded by books, but they are also "literally" surrounded, meaning that they are completely encircled by the books. The fact that the books are angry makes the situation funnier because it's unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the overuse of the word "literally" in figurative situations. In this case, the couple is actually surrounded by anthropomorphized books, which would be a very strange situation to find oneself in. However, because the word "literally" is so often used incorrectly, the joke is that the couple might not even realize that they are in a strange situation, because they would just assume that the books are not really angry.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is in a very dangerous situation, being surrounded by angry human-sized books, but they are only concerned with the fact that they are "literally" surrounded, as if that is the only thing they should be worried about. This is ironic because, while being surrounded is a bad thing, it's not as bad as being actually attacked by the books.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The couple is surrounded by literally angry books, but the books are not alive, so they are also surrounded by metaphors. The situation is made funnier by the fact that the books are human-sized, making the metaphor even more apt.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the books are angry and they are human-sized, so they are literally surrounding the couple. The couple is surrounded by the books in a way that is threatening and dangerous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The situation is unusual because the people are surrounded by books, and the joke cleverly uses the word "literally" to mean both that the people are actually surrounded by books, and that the books are, well, literary.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is surrounded by solicitors who are trying to get them to sign up for something or buy something. The solicitors are angry because the couple is ignoring them. The couple is described as being "literally surrounded" because they are being literally surrounded by people.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="157.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="159.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
