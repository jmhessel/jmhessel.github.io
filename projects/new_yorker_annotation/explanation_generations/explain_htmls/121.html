The joke is also funny because a marching band is an out-of-place and incongruous sight in the middle of a desert.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the marching band leader is out of place in the desert. Not only is a marching band an unlikely thing to find in the middle of a desert, but the leader is also extremely well-groomed, with not a hair out of place. This is in contrast to the two exhausted men who are crawling behind him, who are likely very dirty and unkempt. The joke is that the leader could also use a shave, implying that he is just as out of place as the men.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The men are so dehydrated from crawling through the desert that they are hallucinating and think that the band leader is a mirage. In actuality, the bandleader is real, but the joke is that he is so hairy that he looks like he could use a shave. The joke would be funnier if the bandleader actually was a mirage, but it's still funny because it's a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected. The fact that there is a marching band leader in the middle of the desert is surreal, and the joke pokes fun at the conductor's appearance. The joke is also a play on words, because "shave" can mean to get rid of hair (which the conductor could use) or to drink water (which the men need).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bandleader, who is leading the men through the desert, is very sweaty anddirty. The joke implies that the bandleader is also in need of a shave, suggesting that he is not taking care of himself. This is unexpected because, usually, bandleaders are shown as being very well-groomed and put-together.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "shave" can mean two things: first, to shave one's face, and second, to decrease the number or amount of something. In this case, the joke is saying that the men need to shave their faces (i.e., they need to shave their beards), but it's also saying that the bandleader could use a shave (i.e., he needs to decrease the number of people in his band). The fact that it's a desert marching band makes it even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "we're not the only ones that could use a shave" is usually said to mean "we're not the only ones that could use some help." In this case, the help they need is water, and they're saying it to the band leader, who is also dehydrated. The joke is funny because it's a clever way to point out the band leader's dehydration.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the band leader, who is supposed to be leading the way, is completely out of place in the desert. He is wearing a suit and has a shaved head, which is not appropriate for the hot, dry conditions. The joke implies that the band leader is lost, and the two men are following him because they think he knows where he is going.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the band leader, who is perfectly healthy and does not seem to be in need of any assistance, is leading the two exhausted, dehydrated men through the desert. The implication is that the band leader is lost and is equally in need of help to find his way out of the desert.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: "shave" can mean to drink water (i.e., rehydrate), which is what the bandleader and the men are doing, or it can mean to remove hair, which is something that the bandleader could also use, given his unkempt appearance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men are so exhausted from crawling through the desert that they can't even muster the energy to make fun of the bandleader's extremely outdated hairstyle. It's also funny because, in contrast to the men, who are desperately trying to find water, the bandleader looks completely out of place, as if he's just taking a leisurely stroll through the desert.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at the situation they are in. They are clearly in dire need of water, and yet the band leader is still out in the middle of nowhere leading a marching band. The joke is that the band leader is just as in need of water as they are, and maybe even more so given that he is dehydrated and possibly sunburned.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men who are struggling to make it through the desert are clearly dehydrated and exhausted, while the band leader looks fairly well put together. This suggests that the band leader isn't really struggling at all, he's just leading them on a merry chase.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The marching band leader is called a "bandleader," which is a homophone for "bandit." Thus, the joke is implying that the bandit is leading the two men through the desert to their doom.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The desert is a dry and barren place, so the men are dehydrated and need water. The bandleader is also in the desert, and he's probably dehydrated as well. However, the joke is also funny because the bandleader is a shave away from being a bald man, so the joke suggests that the desert has made the men so dehydrated that they are now hallucinating.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
