This would be a perfectly fine pool if it were at the beach, but in the middle of a mountain town, it's out of place. The joke is also funny because "beach ball" can be a synonym for "breasts," making it a double entendre.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "adequate" can mean "sufficient" or "good enough," but it can also mean "the smallest quantity or degree possible." In this case, the person is saying that their beach ball is "sufficient" or "good enough," but it's also the smallest beach ball possible.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the beach ball is clearly not an adequate substitute for the pool. The beach ball is too small to be used as a pool, and it's not even filled with water. This joke pokes fun at the idea that something can be "good enough" when it's clearly not.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the pool is completely filled with a beach ball, rendering it useless for swimming. The speaker's comment that the pool is "perfectly adequate" is a deadpan way of saying that it is not adequate at all for its intended purpose.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in this scenario, the size of the beach ball relative to the size of the pool is commented on. This is a play on words because "adeqate" can mean both "large enough" and "sufficient," but in this case, it's being used to describe the size of the ball as being "perfectly adequate" or "just right."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker says "yours is perfectly adequate" in response to seeing the size of the other person's beach ball. The joke works because "perfectly adequate" is a backhanded compliment, which is humorous because it's an unexpected thing to say in response to seeing such a large, impressive beach ball.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who is spoke to has a very large beach ball, while the person who spoke is holding a much smaller one. The joke is making fun of the idea that someone could have an "adequate" beach ball, when the beach ball is so small.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the pool being filled with a beach ball is clearly not adequate. The person making the statement is either unaware of the situation or being deliberately obtuse.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is saying that the other person's pool, which is completely filled with a beach ball, is "perfectly adequate." This is a backhanded compliment, because the speaker is implying that the pool is not particularly special or impressive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the pool is filled with a giant beach ball, which is not what people usually expect to see in a pool. The joke is also funny because the person is saying that the pool is "perfectly adequate," which is a very bland way to describe a pool that is filled with a giant beach ball.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. When one hears the phrase "your pool is perfectly adequate," they usually think it is a compliment. However, in this context, the speaker is saying that the pool is just adequate, or not very special, because it is filled with a beach ball.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is saying that the person's pool (full of a beach ball) is "perfectly adequate." The word "adequate" usually has a negative connotation, meaning that something is "good enough, but not great." In this case, the pool is literally filled with a beach ball, which most people would not consider to be an "adequate" pool.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is telling the person next to them that their pool is "perfectly adequate," which is a much more polite way of saying "it's not as good as mine." The joke is made funnier by the fact that the pool is completely filled with a beach ball, which makes it unusable for swimming.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman in the pool is saying that her husband's penis is "perfectly adequate," but the joke is that she's actually talking about the pool being "perfectly adequate" for their needs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The speaker is looking at the pool, which is filled with a beach ball, and saying that it is "perfectly adequate." The word "perfectly" can mean "completely" or "totally," in addition to its more usual meaning of "nicely" or "appropriately." In this case, the speaker is implying that the pool is completely filled with the beach ball, which is probably not what the pool-owner intended.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="120.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="122.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
