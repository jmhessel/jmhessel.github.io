The woman is saying that the couple should keep in mind that the neighborhood is expanding, which usually is a good thing because it means the property values will increase. In this case, however, the neighborhood is literally expanding because the planets and moons are getting closer, which is not a desirable situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the planets and stars being visible from the home is a selling point for most people, in this context, it's a warning: the couple should be aware that the neighborhood is "expanding" outwards, and eventually, they will be living in space.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The term "neighborhood" can refer to both the area surrounding a property and the people who live near each other. In this case, the "neighborhood" is literally expanding because it is outer space and there are new planets forming. The realtor is telling the potential buyers that the neighborhood is a good investment because it is constantly growing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of the word "expanding." In the context of real estate, "expanding" usually means that the nearby houses are being built on, thus making the neighborhood bigger. However, in this context, "expanding" means that the universe is constantly expanding, so the house is literally getting further away from the other houses in the "neighborhood."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it puns on the idea of "gentrification." In gentrification, a neighborhood is "improved" by, e.g., new, upscale businesses and real estate developments moving in, which often results in increased rent and property values, and pushes out the original residents who can't afford the new prices. Here, the neighborhood is literally expanding (because it's in space), but the same idea of wealthier people moving in and pricing out the original residents applies.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the realtor is trying to sell the couple on the house by pointing out that the neighborhood is expanding, but in actuality, the planets they can see outside are just getting bigger because they are closer to the house (since the house is in space). The realtor is using typical real estate rhetoric to try to sell them on the house, but in this case, it doesn't make sense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is looking at an empty house, and the real estate agent tries to sell them on the fact that the neighborhood is "expanding." This is a pun because "expanding" can mean both that the neighborhood is getting bigger (physically), or that it's getting better (in terms of amenities and quality). However, given that the only thing outside the window is planets and moons, it's clear that the neighborhood is only expanding in the physical sense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is trying to sell the couple on the house by pointing out the close proximity of the planets and moons, which is usually not considered a desirable feature in a neighborhood. However, she does have a point that the neighborhood is "expanding" in the sense that it is becoming more populated with celestial bodies.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the couple is looking at a house that is literally in space, the realtor is still trying to sell them on the house by pointing out the positive aspects of the neighborhood. This is absurd because, in space, there are no neighbors, and even if there were, they would be too far away to matter.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the realtor is trying to sell the room by pointing out that, since it's near space, the neighborhood is growing (i.e., there are more planets that can be seen from the window). However, the other people in the room are not interested in living in space, and the joke is that the realtor is overselling the room by pointing out this irrelevant detail.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is looking at a house that is in space, and the realtor says that the neighborhood is expanding. This is ironic because, while the couple is literally looking at the expansion of the universe, the realtor is using the idiom "the neighborhood is expanding" to mean that there are more people moving in.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of space, "the neighborhood expanding" is a humorous way of saying that the universe is constantly expanding. The joke implies that, even though the room for sale is currently in an empty void of space, eventually more and more planets and galaxies will be built around it as the universe expands, making it a prime real estate investment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The realtor is saying that the couple should keep in mind that the neighborhood (of planets and stars) is constantly expanding, so they shouldn't be worried about the house being too close to other houses (in space). This is a humorous way of reassuring the couple that, even though the house is in space, it's still a good investment because the neighbors (planets and stars) are always moving further away.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the two meaning of the word "expanding." In this context, "expanding" can mean "getting larger" or "moving outwards." The former meaning is a typical property of space, as objects located in space can get bigger (e.g., stars can grow larger over time, or galaxies can collide and grow in size). However, the latter meaning is also true in this context: because the couple is looking at planets, which are located in space, they are also technically expanding outward. This joke combines both meanings of the word for humorous effect.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the word "expanding." In this context, the word "expanding" refers to the universe expanding, i.e., the distance between galaxies increasing over time. However, the word can also refer to a neighborhood growing, i.e., more houses being built. The joke is clever because it is true in both senses: the neighborhood (universe) is indeed expanding.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="6.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="8.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
