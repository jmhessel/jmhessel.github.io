However, in this scene, the distance between the two men is so great that it's comical. The joke is further funnier because, even though the subordinate is so far away, the boss is still talking to him as if he was right next to him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man behind the desk is asking if the other man is willing to move away from his current location, to which the other man clearly is not interested in doing. However, the man behind the desk could also be asking if the other man is willing to "re-locate" himself in the line of chairs, to which he would presumably be more amenable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man's boss is asking if he is willing to move chairs in order to be closer to him, but the man misinterprets this as a question about whether he is willing to move to a new location.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man behind the desk is the CEO of the company, and he's asking the other man if he's willing to move to a different location. The joke is funny because it's unexpected: the CEO is usually the one who has to relocate, not the other way around.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is asking if the other man is willing to "re-locate", or move, but the other man is already sitting in a line of chairs, so he's literally already located. The joke is a play on the fact that sometimes people ask seemingly obvious questions that have a hidden meaning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the question is a bit unexpected. The man asking the question is basically saying, "Are you willing to move closer to me so I can yell at you more easily?" In other words, the question is a veiled threat: if you don't want to move closer to me, I'll have to fire you. The joke is clever because it pokes fun at the power dynamic in many workplaces, where the boss feels like they can mistreat their employees because they have the authority to do so.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is asking if the other man is willing to move up in line --- that is, to relocate --- and the other man is willing to do so literally, by moving the chairs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Relocate" can mean to move to a different location, but it can also mean to remove something. In this case, the joke is implying that the person in the back is too far from the front and needs to be removed (i.e., "relocated"), because there are too many chairs in the office.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man behind the desk is the CEO of the company, and he is offering a promotion to the man in the foreground. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the man in the foreground is sitting in the back of the line of chairs, so the CEO is asking if he is willing to "relocate" to the front of the line. The joke is also clever because it is a play on the fact that CEOs are often reluctant to promote people from within their own company, and instead prefer to hire people from the outside.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is willing to "relocate" himself by moving the chairs closer to his boss so that he can have a better chance of getting a promotion. However, the joke also suggests that the man is willing to "relocate" himself by moving to a different company entirely, which is a more extreme measure.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's boss is asking him if he's willing to move chairs, instead of move to a different location. This joke plays on the fact that "relocate" can mean both move physically to a different place, as well as moving something from one place to another. In this case, the boss is only asking if the man is willing to move chairs, not move himself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is asking the person in the back if they are willing to move to another chair, even though there are plenty of chairs in the office. This is a play on the common question during job interviews of "are you willing to relocate?" The joke is funny because it's a absurd question to ask given the circumstances.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in the back is sitting in an empty office, surrounded by chairs. It's implied that the person is about to be fired, and the boss is offering the person the option to "relocate" their chair to the unemployment office.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is asking if the other man is willing to move chairs, i.e., to get closer to the speaker, so they can continue their conversation. However, the Boss is sitting in the chair directly in front of the man, and the man is asking if he's willing to move, i.e., to change his location, implying that theBoss is getting in the way of the conversation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is asking his coworker if he's willing to move chairs, i.e., relocate, in order to be closer to his boss. The joke is clever because it's a play on words --- "relocate" can mean both moving physically closer to someone, or moving something closer to someone.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="6.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="8.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
