This is because when you slip on a banana peel, you usually bruise yourself. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words; the therapist is talking about how some people bruise easily, but she could also be talking about how some people are more prone to mental/emotional bruising.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the therapist is so out of touch that she doesn't realize that the banana is not a patient. The therapist is treating the banana as if it were a human patient, and is even making a comment about how some people bruise easier than others, as if the banana had bruises. The joke is humorous because it's a play on words; the therapist is using the word "bruise" in the emotional sense, but the banana is a fruit that can literally bruise.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is talking to the banana as if it were her patient. The therapist is treating the banana as if it were a human patient, which is absurd. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the phrase "some of us are more delicate than others", which is often used to describe why people bruise easily.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="6.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="8.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
