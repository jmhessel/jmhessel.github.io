The joke is clever because it plays on the double meaning of "slow": in one sense, the elderly couple was probably "slow" in the sense of being not very quick or agile; but in another sense, they were probably "slow" in the sense of being methodical and taking their time. Either way, the joke is clever and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. A "tad slow on their feet" means that they are a little bit slow in their movements, but in this case, it means that they were too slow to get out of the way of the giant hole that was being dug. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the size of the hole: typically, a hole on a miniature golf course would be too small for a person to fit in, but this hole is so big that a whole family could fit in it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "slow" can mean "not moving quickly" or "not intelligent." In this case, the joke is implying that the previous owners were not intelligent, and thus were taken advantage of when they sold the course to the current owners.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="65.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="67.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
