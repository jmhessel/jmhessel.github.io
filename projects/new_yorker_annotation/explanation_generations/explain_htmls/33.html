It's a humorous play on the idea that even Death is subject to the laws of the land.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Grim Reaper, who personifies death, cannot die. He is also not subject to the laws of mortals, since he is not mortal. So, it is ironic that he is in court for tax evasion, which is a human law that does not apply to him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the client is Death, who is usually associated with things like murder, not tax evasion. It's unexpected that Death would be in court for tax evasion, which is a more mundane crime.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because tax evasion is a crime that people typically associate with getting caught by the IRS: here, the IRS is personified by Death. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words --- "Getting you for tax evasion" can also mean "Convicting you of tax evasion".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Grim Reaper, who personifies death, is being tried for tax evasion, which is something that is often associated with living people. The joke pokes fun at the inevitability of death, even for those who personify it, by having the Grim Reaper face the ultimate consequence: death.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because tax evasion is often associated with illegal activities, and the grim reaper is, of course, death personified. So, the joke is playing on the incongruity of the Grim Reaper being held accountable to the law in a court of law, despite being, well, death.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because death is, of course, not a personification that is subject to tax law. The joke implies that even Death cannot escape the long arm of the IRS.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because tax evasion is often considered a victimless crime, since the government is the only entity that loses out on revenue. However, in this case, the Grim Reaper has been caught and is being prosecuted for tax evasion, leading to his untimely death. The joke highlights the irony of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because tax evasion is often seen as a victimless crime, and one that is difficult to catch people for. If even the Grim Reaper can be caught and convicted of tax evasion, it goes to show how difficult it is to truly avoid paying taxes.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "to get someone for tax evasion" means to catch them and punish them for not paying their taxes. But, in this case, the grim reaper has actually been caught and is being prosecuted for tax evasion. The fact that he is being punished for something that is normally associated with catching people who have done something wrong is ironic and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "death" can be used as a noun meaning the end of life, or as a verb meaning to kill someone. In this case, the lawyer is using it as a verb, meaning that his client (Death) has been charged with tax evasion. This is a play on words because usually when someone is charged with tax evasion, it is because they have been trying to avoid paying taxes, which is effectively killing the government's revenue. In this case, the lawyer is saying that his client (Death) has been charged with tax evasion because he has been avoiding paying taxes, which is effectively killing the government's revenue.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Grim Reaper is, fittingly, death personified. He is not subject to the laws of mortals, yet he is in court for tax evasion. The joke is clever because, even though Grim Reaper is above the law, he still must follow the law of the land --- in this case, paying taxes.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because The Grim Reaper, a personification of death, is being tried for tax evasion. This is funny because tax evasion is a very human crime and something that death would not have to worry about. Furthermore, the idea of death having to go to court and follow human laws is also funny because death is usually seen as being outside of the law.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the grim reaper, who is responsible for people's deaths, is being prosecuted for tax evasion. It's ironic because, while it's technically possible for the grim reaper to be charged with tax evasion, it's highly unlikely because, as the personification of death, he is not subject to the laws of mortals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the client is Death, who is, of course, not alive and thus cannot be taxed. The lawyer's joke reflects his surprise that the authorities were able to find something to charge Death with, given that he's not alive and thus above the law.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="32.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="34.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
