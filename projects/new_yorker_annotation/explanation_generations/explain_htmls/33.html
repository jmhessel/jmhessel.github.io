The joke is also a play on words, because "book" can mean both to make a reservation, as well as a reference to a jail or prison. So, the man is saying that this was the last time he will book a discount vasectomy, because he might end up in jail next time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is reading a book about getting a vasectomy while he is in a kennel cage at a pound. This is ironic because, typically, people get vasectomies in order to avoid having children, and yet, here he is in a situation where it is quite likely he will end up getting adopted and becoming someone's child.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has been caged at a dog pound after getting a discount vasectomy. The fact that he is reading suggests that he is an intellectual, which makes the joke even funnier because he is in a dog pound. The fact that he got a discount vasectomy implies that he is not the brightest person, which makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the kennel is there because he got a discount vasectomy, which is a surgical procedure to sterilize a man. It's usually done in a doctor's office, not a kennel, so he must have got it from a very shady doctor. The joke is also funny because the man is now regretting his decision to get the vasectomy because it has led him to this undesirable situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The person in the cage next to the person reading is getting a vasectomy, which is a surgical procedure to remove the testicles. The word "discount" can refer to both a sale price on something, and the removal of something (in this case, the testicles).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person speaking is implying that getting a vasectomy (a surgical procedure to permanently prevent pregnancy) is a criminals act that would warrant being locked up in a cage in a kennel. This is obviously not the case, but the contrast between the cheapness/ simplicity of the procedure and the speaker's over-the-top reaction creates the humor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the cage is saying that he won't book a discount vasectomy again, but the joke is that he is saying this while he is in a cage at a kennel. The word "book" can mean to reserve or schedule something, but it can also mean to imprison someone. So, the man is saying that he won't schedule another discount vasectomy, but the joke is that he is saying this while he is imprisoned.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "book" can mean to reserve or schedule something in advance, as in "I booked a flight to Miami." It can also mean a physical book that one reads. In this case, the person is reading a book in their cage at the kennel, which is probably not what they expected when they "booked" their discount vasectomy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is implying that he was tricked or deceived in some way by booking a "discount vasectomy." The fact that he is in a dog shelter implies that perhaps he was given a discount vasectomy by a veterinarian, which would be absurd. The other man in the cage is also upset, implying that he may have also been given a discount vasectomy, which is also amusing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is saying that his current situation, being in a cage at a dog pound, is the result of trying to save money by getting a cheaper vasectomy. The contrast between the two situations - one being a medical procedure and the other being a punishment for a crime - is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is saying that getting a vasectomy (a surgical procedure to permanently prevent pregnancy) at a discount price was a mistake, and he ended up in a kennel as a result. The joke is clever because it takes a common saying ("I'll never do X again") and spins it in a new and unexpected way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is reading a book about vasectomies in a dog kennel. The book is probably about how to get a vasectomy, which is a surgical procedure to prevent pregnancy. The joke is funny because the man is in a discount vasectomy kennel, which suggests that he got his vasectomy done at a discount price.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a clever pun on the phrase "book a discount." In this case, the person has literally booked a discount, as in they found a cheap place to get a vasectomy, but the joke is that they are discounting, or devaluing, the importance or sanctity of the act.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who booked the discount vasectomy thought he was getting a deal, but instead he ended up in a dog shelter. The other man is telling him that this will be the last time he books a discount vasectomy, emphasizing the negative experience.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is in a cage in a kennel meant for animals, presumably because he got a vasectomy at a discount rate from a shady doctor. The existence of such a place underscores the often-negative effects of getting things done at a discount rate.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
