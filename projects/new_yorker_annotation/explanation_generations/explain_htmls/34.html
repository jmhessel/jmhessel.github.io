It's up to the jury to decide whether or not the Reaper is guilty, and the lawyer is giving his client advice on which jurors are more likely to find him guilty, so that they can be removed from the jury. The Reaper, being death itself, is above the law, so the jury's decision is moot, but the lawyer's advice is still funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the client is the Grim Reaper, who is, of course, death personified. Given that, one would expect that the lawyer would have an easy time winning the case since the Grim Reaper is, effectively, death. However, the lawyer is still trying to game the system by trying to get rid of certain jurors, which shows that even death can't guaranteed a win in court.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lawyer's client is Death, and the lawyer is telling Death that he stands a better chance of winning the case if he kills two jurors. The joke is funny because it's a play on the idea that lawyers are unethical and will do whatever it takes to win a case, even if it means resorting to murder.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: "taking out" can mean either to murder or to remove from consideration. The lawyer knows that the Grim Reaper can kill anyone, so he suggests that the Grim Reaper kills two of the jurors to increase their chances of winning the case.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lawyer is nervously suggesting to the Grim Reaper that, in order to increase their chances of winning in court, they should kill two of the jurors. The fact that the lawyer is worried about being unethical in front of the Grim Reaper, who is death personified, is ironic because the Reaper's very existence is unethical.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the Grim Reaper isimmune to the law, his lawyer is still trying to find ways to game the system and give his client the best chance of winning, as if the Reaper is just another defendant. The idea that the Reaper could lose in court is funny because it's so unexpected and goes against our conceptions of death.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the idea of death needing a lawyer is absurd, and the idea of death having to go through a jury trial is even more absurd. The lawyer is making a joke about how he would select jurors if he were representing death, by saying that he would want to remove the jurors who are most likely to convict.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "death penalty." The lawyer is telling his client, who is Death, that if he wants to win the case, he should kill jurors four and seven. The humor comes from the fact that the client is literally Death, so the lawyer's advice is both unethical and literal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Grim Reaper, who is Death personified, is on trial for, presumably, killing someone. The lawyer wants to improve their chances of winning the case by having two specific jurors removed from the jury pool. It is unethical for the lawyer to say this because, in a normal trial, the lawyer is not allowed to know which jurors will be on the case, and so can't pick and choose which ones to try to remove. But, in this case, the lawyer knows that the Grim Reaper can kill two specific jurors, and so is suggesting that he do so to increase their chances of winning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common phrase "It's probably unethical for me to say this, but..." which is often used as a preface to giving someone information they shouldn't have. In this case, the lawyer is telling Death that he thinks they have a better chance of winning if he kills two of the jurors.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the movie "Twelve Angry Men", where a lawyer tries to get his client, who is on trial for murder, acquitted by jury nullification. In the movie, the lawyer gets rid of two jurors by challenging their impartiality. In this case, the lawyer is suggesting that Death, his client, should kill two jurors so that they can't vote.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lawyer is trying to use jury selection to get the Grim Reaper acquitted, when in reality, the Grim Reaper is immune to the law and doesn't need to be worried about being found guilty. The lawyer's suggestion is funny because it's pointless.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lawyer is suggesting that his client, Death, should kill two jurors in order improve the outcome of their trial. It's a play on the idea that lawyers will go to great lengths to get their clients off, even if it means breaking the law.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the grim reaper is the personification of death, and so he is naturally exempt from the law. However, even though he is exempt from the law, his lawyer still gives him legal advice --- which is ironic, because the lawyer's job is to uphold the law, not subvert it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the grim reaper is immune to the law --- he is, after all, death --- so the idea of him being in court is already absurd. Furthermore, the lawyer's suggestion to take out specific jurors is also absurd because, again, the grim reaper is immune to the law. The lawyer's suggestion is futile because the grim reaper can't be convicted no matter what.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="33.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="35.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
