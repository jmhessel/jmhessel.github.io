In this case, the thing they are trying to fix is a creature that the scientist has created, which is a reference to the novel Frankenstein. The joke is clever because, in the context of the novel, the creature is brought to life by electricity, so the man's suggestion to "turn it off and back on again" is actually a good idea.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the lab is trying to revive his creation, Frankenstein's monster, and the other man suggests the same thing one would do when a computer is having glitches: turn it off and back on again. The joke works because it's a common saying that is usually said seriously, but in this context, it's absurd and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the lab is clearly in the process of bringing a creature to life, a la Frankenstein, and the other man's suggestion that he try restarting it is something that is usually said in relation to technology, not animate beings. The joke is funny because it's a non-solution to a very serious problem.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="33.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="35.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
