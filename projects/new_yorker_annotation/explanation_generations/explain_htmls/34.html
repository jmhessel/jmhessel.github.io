The joke suggests that the Green Giant's father was also jolly, but his grandfather was not, thus explaining why the Jolly Green Giant is not actually jolly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Jolly Green Giant is, well, green, and thus he is associated with nature. The idea that nature would be "jolly" is a play on words, as the adjective "jolly" is typically used to describe people (i.e., "jolly ol' Saint Nick"), not inanimate objects. However, the fact that the Giant is attacking people goes against his jolly reputation, making the joke funnier. The joke also cleverly uses the fact that the Giant is green to make a pun about generations: specifically, that the Giant is attacking people because he was born in a different generation than the current one (i.e., the "jolly" generation).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the theory it posits, that the Jolly Green Giant's anger is due to his parents not being jolly, is absurd. It's also funny because it plays on the fact that the Jolly Green Giant is, well, green, and thus, he is associated with the color green, which is often associated with nature/plant life. This implies, absurdly, that the Jolly Green Giant is some sort of plant monster.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The Jolly Green Giant is a giant who is supposed to be jolly, but in this instance, he's Destruction incarnate. The man is making a pun by saying that the Jolly Green Giant is "jolly" in the sense that he's happy to be destroying the city, not in the sense that he's happy and friendly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is making a pun on the word "jolly". In this context, "jolly" is used to describe the Green Giant, who is destroying the city. However, the word can also be used to describe someone who is happy and cheerful. The man is saying that the jolly Green Giant must have skipped a generation, because the current generation is not happy and cheerful.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the Jolly Green Giant is meant to be a friendly character, he is currently attacking the city. The fact that he is rampaging suggests that he is not actually very jolly, and the joke is that this might be because jolliness skipped a generation in his family. This is a play on words because, while the phrase "jolly green giant" is meant to be descriptive of his happy personality, in this context, it is more literal, as he is a giant who is currently jolly (or angry).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman says that the rampaging giant could be her grandfather, since jolliness is supposed to skip a generation. This means that the giant is SUPPOSED to be friendly, but he's not, which is why he's rampaging. The joke is also a play on the saying "X skips a generation," which is often used to describe why people have certain traits that aren't common in their immediate family.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of the Jolly Green Giant going on a rampage, the idea that jolliness skips a generation is a dark joke. The Jolly Green Giant is supposed to be a friendly character, so the idea that he is attacking people is unexpected and disturbing. The joke implies that the current generation of the Giant's family is not as friendly as the previous one, which is why the Giant is attacking people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Jolly Green Giant is a benevolent character who is known for being jolly. However, in this scene, he is attacking the city and causing destruction. The joke implies that the Green Giant's grandfather was probably not very jolly, hence the skipping of a generation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The Jolly Green Giant is supposed to be a benevolent figure, but in this scene, he's attacking everything. The man and woman watching from above say that "jolliness skips a generation," meaning that the Jolly Green Giant's attacking streak might be due to the fact that his parents weren't very jolly, and thus he didn't inherit that trait. However, the way the guy says it also sounds like he's saying that the Jolly Green Giant is attacking because he himself is not jolly, which is a play on the word "jolly."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Jolly Green Giant is behaving in a very un-jolly manner, and the comment about jolliness skipping a generation implies that the Giant's parents were also un-jolly, and that his grandparents were likely the jolly ones. This is a way of saying that the Giant's current behavior is normal for his family, despite how out-of-character it is for the Giant himself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is discussing the fact that the Jolly Green Giant is destroying the city, and making a pun on the word "jolly". The fact that the Jolly Green Giant is acting like Godzilla makes the joke even funnier, because Godzilla is often associated with destroying cities.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Jolly Green Giant, a friendly folklore character, is on a rampage. The joke suggests that the current generation of the Giant's family is less jolly than the previous one, hence the violence. The joke also puns on the word "jolly," which can mean both happy and FAT.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Jolly Green Giant, who is supposed to be a friendly giant, is attacking everything in sight. The man and woman watching from above are probably his children or grandchildren, and the joke is that the jolliness (i.e., friendliness) of the Jolly Green Giant has skipped a generation, implying that the man and woman are not as friendly as he is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Jolly Green Giant is acting out of character by rampaging through the city, and the man and woman watching from above are making a commentary on why this might be happening. They say that jolliness skips a generation, implying that the current generation of Jolly Green Giants is not as jolly as the previous one, hence why he is destroying everything.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
