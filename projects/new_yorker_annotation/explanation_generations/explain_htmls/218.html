However, in this case, the doctor is telling the cavepeople that the reptile will eventually die out, which is not helpful in the situation. This is a play on words because "extinct" can mean both "no longer existing" and "not able to be cured."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is worried about the large reptile biting him, and the other caveman reassures him by saying that the reptile will eventually go extinct. This is a play on words because "go extinct" can mean either "die out" or "to stop existing", so the joke is that the doctor is saying that the reptile will eventually die out ... or that the caveman will eventually stop existing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is making a comment about the person's prognosis for recovery, but phrasing it in terms of the reptile (which presumably attacked the person) going extinct. This is a play on words, as the speaker is saying that the person will eventually recover and the reptile will eventually die, but the phrasing makes it sound like the person will die and the reptile will recover.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who was bitten by the reptile is being told by the other caveperson that the doctor said the bite will eventually go away on its own, just like the reptile will eventually go extinct. The joke is clever because it is play on words: the person will be fine (the bite will go away), just like the reptile will eventually die out.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bite victim is being told that the doctor said their ankle injury will eventually go away on its own, without any treatment. The joke is clever because "extinct" can mean both "no longer in existence" and "to no longer be a problem." In other words, the doctor is saying that the bite will eventually heal and the problem will go away, just like a species of animal that dies out.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is telling the person that the reptile attached to their ankle will eventually die off and go extinct. This is a play on words because the doctor is saying that the person doesn't need to worry about the reptile, because it will eventually die, just like all the other dinosaurs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because dinosaurs are extinct, so the doctor's prognosis is correct. However, the joke is also funny because the man's leg is being bitten by a dinosaur, which is an extremely unusual situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the double meaning of "extinct." If something is "extinct," it means it's no longer alive. In this case, the doctor is saying that the reptile will die and the bite will eventually heal. However, the cavemen are worried that the person who was bitten by the reptile will die, and they will become extinct.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is telling the caveman that the reptile will eventually die out and go away, but the reptiles are actually the ancestors of dinosaurs. The joke is clever because it uses a double meaning of the word "extinct": to mean "no longer alive" but also "to no longer exist." In other words, the doctor is saying that the reptile will go extinct in the sense that it will no longer be alive, but it will also go extinct in the sense that it will no longer exist at all because it will have evolved into a dinosaur.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. If someone is attacked by a reptile, they would usually go to the doctor to get treatment. In this case, the doctor says that the reptile bite will eventually go away on its own, like how many species of reptiles eventually went extinct.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is talking about his ankle biting injury in terms of evolution. He is saying that the doctor told him the injury will eventually go away on its own, just like how a species can go extinct if it is not fit enough to survive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it uses the double-meaning of the word "extinct": the first meaning is that the dinosaurs went extinct which is why they aren't around today. The second meaning is that the doctor is saying the man's leg will eventually die (i.e., go "extinct"), because it's being bitten by a dinosaur.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The person bitten by the reptile will eventually die, but the reptile will also eventually die because it is from the dinosaurs era, which is no longer extant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in the modern day, if someone was bitten by a reptile, they would go to the doctor and receive medical attention. However, in this situation, because the reptile is attacking a caveman, the doctor is telling them that the reptile will eventually just die out, as if the caveman doesn't need to do anything. The joke is poking fun at how medical knowledge has progressed since the time of cavemen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the cave is saying that the doctor told him the dinosaur will eventually go extinct, meaning the dinosaur will die out. However, the fact that the man is a caveman means that the dinosaurs have already gone extinct and he is the one that is going to die out.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="217.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="219.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
