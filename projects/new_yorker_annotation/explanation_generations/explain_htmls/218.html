However, the woman is mistaking the painting for a urinal, which was famously submitted as an artwork by Marcel Duchamp. The joke pokes fun at the often pretentious and unapproachable nature of modern art.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the famous Dadaist work "Fountain" by Marcel Duchamp, which is a urinal that was submitted as a work of art. The woman in the painting is looking at a Mondrian painting, which is a very different type of work, so the joke is that she is confusing the two artists.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman in the painting looks like she's talking to the man in the other painting, when in reality she's just looking at a painting of a man. The joke is a play on the fact that some people consider modern art to be nonsensical, and that anyone could just put a urinal in a gallery and claim it's art.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="217.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="219.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
