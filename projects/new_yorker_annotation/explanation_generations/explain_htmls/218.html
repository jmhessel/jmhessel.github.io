The phrase "some guys never make it out of the plastic bag" is a saying that means some men never amount to much or never leave their mother's basement. However, in this context, the phrase takes on a literal meaning: the men in the fishbowl are trapped inside of a plastic bag.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "some guys never make it out of the plastic bag" is often used to refer to men who are unsuccessful with women, i.e., they are still virgins. In this case, the joke is referring to the fact that the men are literally in a plastic bag, i.e., a fishbowl, and they have not "made it out" because they are still working.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "Some guys never make it out of the plastic bag" is usually used to describe men who are trapped in a cycle of low-paying jobs with no opportunity for advancement. In this case, the plastic bag is literal, as the men are trapped in a fishbowl. The joke is clever because it's both a play on words and a visual pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "some guys never make it out of the plastic bag" is a common saying that means some guys never make it out of their mothers' basements. In this case, the joke is changed to "some guys never make it out of the fishbowl", which is a more literal interpretation of the original phrase.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "plastic bag" can refer to the packaging that fish come in when they are bought at a store, but it can also refer to a body bag, which is a bag that is used to transport dead bodies. In this case, the joke is implying that the people in the fishbowl are so trapped in their corporate lifestyles that they might as well be dead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Some guys never make it out of the plastic bag" can mean that they never amount to anything and are always stuck in a menial job. However, in this context, "make it out of the plastic bag" means to escape from the fishbowl, which is impossible. The joke is clever because it's true in both senses.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "some guys never make it out of the plastic bag" is usually used to describe how some men never leave their mother's basement and never grow up. However, in this context, the phrase is literal: the men are in a fishbowl and they are actually inside of a plastic bag.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people in the fish bowl are white-collar workers, meaning they work in an office environment. The joke is that these people are so dedicated to their work that they never take a break, not even to leave the office for lunch. They presumably eat their lunch at their desk, like many office workers do. The punchline is that these workers are so dedicated that they never leave the office, not even to go home at the end of the day. They are stuck in the office, like a fish in a bowl.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of "make it out of the plastic bag." In a normal scenario, people "make it out of the plastic bag" by becoming successful; however, in this context, "make it out of the plastic bag" means to survive. The joke is clever because it implies that the people in the fishbowl are not successful (hence why they're stuck in the fishbowl), but it also playfully suggests that they might not make it out of the fishbowl alive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "Some guys never make it out of the plastic bag" is a common saying that means some people never make it out of their parents' basement or never leave their hometown. In this case, the joke is literal: some people (the people in the fishbowl) never make it out of the plastic bag (the fishbowl).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The men in the fishbowl are white-collar workers, and they are often referred to as "the little people." In this case, the "little people" are actually small enough to fit in a fishbowl. The joke is also a commentary on how some people never make it out of their comfort zone or end up doing the same job their whole life.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Some guys never make it out of the plastic bag" can mean two things: either that some men never leave their home and thus never have opportunities to socialize (and so they stay "in the plastic bag"), or that some men never leave their mother's basement (and so they stay "in the plastic bag" of their mother's house). In this context, the joke is referring to the fact that the two men work in a fishbowl and thus are always on display and never have any privacy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words.

The phrase "some guys never make it out of the plastic bag" is often used to describe men who are unsuccessful with women and/or life in general. In this case, the plastic bag refers to the fishbowl that the men are working in. The joke implies that the men are unsuccessful because they are stuck in the fishbowl, and they will never make it out of there to achieve success.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Some guys never make it out of the plastic bag" can mean two things: first, that some men never leave their mother's house and live a sheltered life. Second, it can mean that some men never leave their office and spend their whole lives working. In this case, the joke is referring to the latter meaning, but the fact that the men are literally in a plastic bag (i.e., the fishbowl) makes it funnier.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
