He deserves a little respect.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is acting like a spoiled and arrogant monarch, despite the fact that he is just a cat. The cat's "subjects" (the couple) are indulging him by allowing him to sit on a throne in their living room, and the woman even looks concerned for his wellbeing. The cat's behavior is exaggerated to make fun of how people often treat royalty with more respect than they deserve.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is being treated like a king, even though it is just a cat. The joke is a play on the saying "respect is earned, not given," meaning that people should only be respected if they have done something to earn it. The cat in this situation has "earned" its respect by making videos that have made a lot of money.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is acting like a spoiled king or celebrity, and the couple is treating it like one. The cat has bought a house with the money it has made from its videos, and so it deserves to be respected as a result. However, the cat is still just a cat, and so the couple's respect is disproportionate to the cat's actual accomplishments.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is acting like a king or a celebrity, and the couple is treating him accordingly. In reality, while some animals (like dogs) might be considered family members, cats are often thought of as less important, even though they may be just as lovable. The joke is funny because it exaggerates this discrepancy to an absurd level.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is acting like a king, but it's just a cat. The fact that the cat has a crown and is sitting on a throne is ridiculous, and the fact that its owners are surrounding it with happiness is even more so. The joke is implying that the cat is only acting like a king because it has money (from its videos), and not because it actually deserves respect.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is acting like a king, but he's really just a pet that lives in the house. The couple is treating him like he's a real king, which is silly. The joke is also funny because it's true that pet videos can make a lot of money, so the cat does deserve some respect!</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat's owner is saying that the cat deserves respect because he bought the house with his videos. This is a play on the saying " respect is earned, not given." The cat did something to earn the respect of his owner, in this case, making a lot of money.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is being treated like a king, but the reason why is because its videos on the internet made the family money. This is a play on the saying, "Respect your elders," because usually, the reason to respect elders is because of their age and wisdom, not because of something trivial like their internet fame.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is acting like a king or a wealthy person, and the couple is treating him accordingly. The cat is fat because he probably spends a lot of time sitting around, like a king or a wealthy person. And the cat has a crown because he is a king or a wealthy person. The cat's videos have bought the house, which is a reference to how wealthy people often have their houses bought for them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is sitting in a throne like a king, and the couple is treating him with respect even though he's just a cat. The cat has earned their respect because he has made money through his videos, which is a more humorous and unexpected reason for respect than simply being a king.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is living a life of luxury, while the couple is living a life of poverty; despite this, the couple still Referring to the cat as "His videos bought this house", the man is saying that the cat's life of luxury is due to the fact that he is a popular internet personality, with his own line of videos that make a lot of money. The couple is likely living in the cat's house, and yet the man still says that the cat deserves respect.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is sitting on a throne like a king, but the reason the cat has this luxury is because its owner's make money off of YouTube videos of the cat, rather than the cat having done something to earn the title of "king." The cat getting respect, then, is ironic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is clearly obese, yet the woman is saying that he "deserves a little respect." The joke is making fun of the fact that, even though the cat is overweight and not doing anything that requires respect, he is still being given respect (in the form of a comfy throne to sit on).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat's owner is acting as if the cat should be respected because it made a lot of money. However, the cat is not a person, and so it does not deserve the same level of respect as a human being. The joke is absurd and humorous because it over-exaggerates the worth of a cat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat's owner is treating the cat like a king or celebrity, despite the fact that he's just a regular cat. The cat's owner is probably referring to the fact that cat videos are popular on the internet, and that their cat's videos have generated a lot of views (and potentially revenue). Even though the cat is just a regular cat, its owner is treating it like it's a famous and important cat.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="79.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="81.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
