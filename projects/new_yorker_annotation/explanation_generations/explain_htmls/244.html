The bull in the china shop doesn't charge, meaning he doesn't demand payment for breaking things, because he's already been in the business for a long time and has already established himself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is talking about the bull, but the way she phrases it makes it sound like she is talking about the China shop owner. She says "he doesn't charge as much as he used to," which could mean that the bull doesn't charge (i.e. run into) things as much as he used to, or it could mean that the shop owner doesn't charge (i.e. price) his items as high as he used to.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the antique store owner is a bull, which is an animal that is traditionally associated with strength and virility. However, the bull is now old and no longer charges as much as it used to, which is a play on the fact that the bull is no longer as strong or virile as it once was.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The bull is charged with looking at the china, but he doesn't charge as much (he's not as interested/he's lost his price), as he used to.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull is in a china shop, and is well-behaved. This is a play on the phrase "a bull in a china shop," which is used to describe someone who is clumsy or not well-mannered. However, in this case, the bull is actually behaving properly, which is why the joke is funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the bull is examining the cup, the customer implies that the bull is not charging as much as he used to. This joke plays on the stereotype that bulls are charging animals, and suggests that even bulls can have a change in pricing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the implication is that the bull has been to this China shop before and the shop owner has given him a discount because he's a repeat customer. The joke is clever because it's a play on the phrase "to charge by the bull," which means to charge a lot of money.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull is usually a sign of virility and strength, so the customers in the store are surprised that the bull is working there and is relatively calm. The joke is also a play on words because the word "charge" can mean both the price of an item and to attack.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "He doesn't charge as much as he used to" could mean that the bull no longer costs money to see, or that the bull charges less for china than he used to.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The bull is not charging customers as much money as he used to, implying that he has become more lenient over time. However, the other meaning of "charge" is to attack, which would be more in line with what one would expect a bull to do. Thus, the joke is unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull is a wild animal, and yet it is behaving in a very polite and sedate manner in the china shop. This is a play on words, because the bull is not literally charging (i.e., running) through the store, but it is still behaving in an unexpected and amusing way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull is a wild animal, and it is usually not well-mannered or interested in things like china cups. However, this bull is different, and it is actually behaving like an expensive antique. The joke is also a play on words, because "charging" is both a reference to the bull's horn, and also a reference to the fact that it is behaving like an expensive piece of china.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull is in a china shop, and bulls are known for beingdestructive animals. The bull is also the shop owner, which means that he's probably not charging as much for his items, since he's already broken them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "charge" can mean two things: 1) the price of an item, and 2) to run into something. The bull in the store is interacting with the cups in a way that makes it appear as if he's going to charge into them, but the woman says that he doesn't charge as much as he used to --- meaning that the price of the cups has gone down.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "charge" has two meanings here: one is the fee that the bull charges for looking at the china (i.e. the price), and the other is the bull's horn, which is a common symbol of the animal. Thus, the joke is saying that the bull doesn't charge (i.e. fee) as much as he used to, but he also doesn't have as big of a horn as he used to.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="243.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="245.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
