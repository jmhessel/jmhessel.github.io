However, the bird is being kept in a cage because it is a flight risk, i.e., it might try to fly away. The joke is clever because it uses a pun on the phrase "flight risk."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because birds are creatures that can fly, so the bird in the cage is ironically a "flight risk." The joke is also funny because it's a play on words; the phrase "flight risk" is typically used to describe a criminal defendant who might flee the jurisdiction if they are released on bail, but in this case, the bird is literarily a flight risk because they can fly away.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bird in the cage is literally a flight risk: if he gets out of the cage, he can fly away. But, the term "flight risk" is usually used to describe criminals who might flee before their trial, so the bird is also a metaphor for a criminal. The other birds in the nest are also criminals, which is why their mother is explaining the situation to them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bird in the cage is probably there because it is considered a "flight risk" - meaning, it is likely to try to fly away and escape. This is a common term used in the justice system for humans who are considered likely to skip out on their court date or try to flee the country. However, it's comical to apply this term to a bird, because all birds are technically "flight risks."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bird in the cage is 'trapped' in the tree, and can't fly away. The fact that the bird is in a cage is also ironic, because it's normally birds that are kept in cages, rather than the other way around.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bird in the cage is in a tree, which goes against the definition of a "flight risk." A flight risk is defined as "a person who is deemed likely to flee if granted bail." In this case, the bird has nowhere to flee to because it is already in a tree.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The bird in the cage is a 'flight risk' because he might try to fly away, but he is also at risk because he is in a cage high up in a tree. This joke also highlights the contrast between the free birds and the bird that is trapped in the cage.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bird in the cage is usually seen as a symbol of freedom, because they can fly. However, in this case, the bird is in a cage because it was deemed a flight risk, which means it's the opposite of free. The joke is clever because it uses the meaning of "flight" in two different ways.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bird in the cage is probably there because it was put there by humans, and not because it belongs in the cage naturally. The bird is a 'flight risk' because it might fly away if it were not in the cage. However, the fact that the bird is in a tree makes the joke funnier, because the bird could technically fly away if it wanted to, making the cage pointless.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "flight risk." A flight risk is usually a person who is likely to try to flee or escape, so they are considered a risk to society. In this case, the bird in the cage is a flight risk because he is literally a bird, and birds are known for their ability to fly. The mother bird is keeping him caged so he doesn't fly away.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bird in the cage is stuck in the tree and can't fly away, even though he's a bird and that's what they do. The bird is being kept in the cage because he is considered a "flight risk" --- meaning, he is likely to try to fly away and escape. The other birds in the nest are probably younger birds who don't understand why the bird in the cage can't just fly away.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bird in the cage is clearly not a threat to anyone, but is being kept in the cage anyway. The joke plays on the phrase "flight risk," which is usually used to describe a person who is likely to flee if given the opportunity. In this case, the bird is actually a risk to take flight, but it's not going to do anything with that opportunity, making the phrase ironic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The bird in the cage is a "flight risk," meaning that he is likely to try to fly away and escape, so they have to keep him in a cage. But, the bird is also a physical risk to others, because if he tries to fly away he could crash into other birds or their nest. So, the mother bird is explaining that he is a risk to their safety and needs to be caged for everyone's protection.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The bird in the cage is a "flight risk," meaning that he is likely to try to escape, which is why he is in a cage. However, the mother bird is also saying that the bird in the cage is a risk because he might try to fly, which is also ironic because birds can actually fly.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="243.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="245.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
