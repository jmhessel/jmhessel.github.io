In this case, the woman detective is "beside herself" because she literally opened up her own body to reveal another smaller Russian doll inside.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the series of dolls in the window are a visual representation of the phrase "to be beside oneself", which means to be so emotional that one is not thinking clearly. The woman in the badge is clearly angry with the man, who is unkempt and doesn't look like he is taking the situation seriously. The joke implies that the man was the one who interrogated the witness/suspect, and he was so successful in getting her to talk that she is now emotional and not thinking clearly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman in the interrogation room is trying to get the man to confess to a crime, and she's succeeded in getting him to "open up." However, the man is now "beside himself" because he's realize that he's incriminated himself. The joke is also made funnier by the fact that the suspects in the case are Matryoshka dolls, which are themselves Russian nesting dolls that open up to reveal smaller dolls inside.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman detective got the suspect "to open up" meaning to get her to confession through interrogation. However, the word "open" can also mean to make something wider, and in this case, the woman detective made the suspect's body wider by opening her up like a Russian nesting doll. So now the suspect is "beside herself" because she is literally next to the woman detective in terms of physical space.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the phrase "beside herself" usually means that someone is so angry/upset that they've lost control of themselves, but in this context, it literally means that the woman has opened up the Matryoshka doll and is now holding the smaller doll "beside herself." The joke is clever because it's a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "beside herself", which can mean either "angry" or "not in her right mind". In this case, the latter meaning is more appropriate, as the series of dolls in the window implies that the woman being questioned is not in her right mind. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words; instead of the woman opening up emotionally to the interrogator, she's opened up physically, as in she's opened her legs to reveal a series of smaller dolls, similar to the ones in the window.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman in the badge is a police interrogator, and she's trying to get information out of the man in front of her. The phrase "to open up" can mean to either confess to a crime or to reveal information, and in this case, the man is telling her about a crime he witnessed. The woman is successful in getting him to "open up," but the information he's giving her is so incriminating and overwhelming that she's "beside herself" with shock.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Opening up" can mean two things: revealing information, or physically opening something (like a container). In this case, the woman "opened up" the man by getting him to reveal information, but now he's "beside himself" because he's literally opened up and is now a row of smaller dolls.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the series of dolls in the window is a play on the phrase "beside oneself," which means to be so emotional that one cannot think clearly. In this context, the woman is "beside herself" with anger at the man, who is trying to take credit for her work in interrogating the "suspect."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is angry with the man because he used the Matryoshka dolls (often called "Russian nesting dolls") in the police lineup, instead of actual people. Opening up the dolls to get to the smaller ones is a literal way of getting the woman to "open up" and talk. However, the man's choice of dolls has resulted in the woman being "beside herself" with anger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is trying to get information from the man, but he is being uncooperative. She gets him to "open up" by threatening to open up his matryoshka doll, but instead of getting information from him, she ends up causing him to become emotional and upset.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's response to the man's claim that he got the suspect to "open up" is a play on words. The phrase "beside herself" can mean that the person is so emotional they are not thinking clearly, but in this context, it takes on a literal meaning as well, given the fact that the dolls are arranged in a line beside the window.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman detective is "beside herself" because she is literally a smaller version of herself, due to the fact that she is a Russian doll. The man detective is "beside herself" because he is sitting next to the woman detective.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "to open up" can mean both to reveal something (like in an interrogation) or to physically open something (like a door or a container). In this case, the woman opened up the container (the matryoshka doll) and found another person inside, who is now "beside herself" with shock.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the dolls are technically "beside" the woman, they are also figuratively "beside themselves". The fact that the woman is trying to get information from the dolls in the first place is what makes the joke humorous.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="134.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="136.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
