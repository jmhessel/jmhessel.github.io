In this case, the dog is tethered to a much less advanced life-form, i.e., humans. The joke implies that the dog is the superior life-form, which is funny because dogs are often seen as loyal and obedient to humans while humans are often seen as fickle and difficult to control.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The aliens are discussing the dog, which they see as an inferior life-form to themselves, and they note that it is tethered, or tied, to the Earth. The joke is clever because it is a unexpected use of the word "tethered," which is usually used in relation to space travel (e.g., a satellite is tethered to a planet).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "man's best friend." In this case, the "inferior life-form" is a human, and the dog is tethered to him. The joke is also funny because it's unexpected; you wouldn't expect to find a suburban dog in space.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog, a common pet on Earth, is considered an "inferior life-form" by the aliens. This is a play on the common perception that dogs are loyal and obedient, while aliens are often perceived as more advanced beings. Thus, the aliens see the dog as being beneath them, when in reality, the dog is far more familiar with the humans than the aliens are.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The dog is "tethered" to the earth (i.e., it's earthbound) because it's a pet, but the aliens misread the situation and think that the dog is literally tethered, or tied, to a human. This misunderstanding is humorous because it's a case of cultural ignorance: the aliens don't understand the concept of pet ownership.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Tethered" can mean both "fastened" or "restricted," as in, the dog was tethered to a tree on Earth before the aliens abducted him. However, it can also mean "limited," as in, the aliens view the dog as an inferior life-form because he is a lower animal on the evolutionary ladder.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The dog is "tethered" to the person it belongs to via the collar, but the aliens see the person as an "inferior life-form." This is a difference in perspective --- to the aliens, the dog is the superior life-form, and to the person, the dog is the inferior life-form.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Tethered" can mean both "attached" or "restricted," so the joke is that the aliens found the dog "attached" to a human, who they deem to be an "inferior life-form." This is humorous because dogs are often considered to be man's best friend, so it is unexpected that the aliens would view them in such a negative light.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Tethered" can mean that the dog is tied up, which is often done to dogs so they don't run away, but it can also mean that the dog is connected to a human by an emotional bond. In this case, the aliens see the dog as being connected to a human by an emotional bond, which is something they don't understand.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is tethered to one of the Humans, and the other two are making an assessment about the intelligence of the dog. They are surprised that the dog is tethered to an inferior life-form, meaning that they think the dog is smarter than the human.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The dog is "tethered" to the person it belongs to on earth, but the aliens found it "tethered" to their spaceship. The aliens are clearly not happy about this, and see the dog as an inferior life-form. This is humorous because dogs are often seen as man's best friend, and are certainly not inferior to humans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The dog is tethered to a leash, but the leash is also a symbol of the humans' power over the dog. Thus, the joke is implying that the humans consider the dog to be an inferior life-form, which is why they are keeping it tethered.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unlikely that a dog would be found in space, and even less likely that it would be tethered to something (most likely a person). It's also funny because the aliens are observing the dog like it's a scientific experiment, and are clearly not fond of the dog or the person it's tethered to.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is a common household pet, and the extraterrestrial beings are baffled by it. They are unable to comprehend why the dog is just sitting there, and they view it as being "tethered" to the humans, who they deem to be an inferior life-form.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The dog is "tethered" to the person it belongs to (likely via a leash), but the aliens found it tethered to an inferior life-form, i.e., a human. This is funny because, to the aliens, humans are most likely an inferior life-form, and so the dog must be of a low intelligence as well since it is associated with humans.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="134.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="136.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
