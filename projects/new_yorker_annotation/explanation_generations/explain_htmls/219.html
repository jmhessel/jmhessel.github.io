This is funny because the animals shouldn't be able to make noise like that in the first place, so the fact that the dog is making too much noise is just a continuation of the absurd situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the sound engineer is asking for less bass in the recording, and the cat replies with a play on words, asking for less "woofer" (another word for dog).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the sound engineer is telling the other person to turn down the bass guitar, which is colloquially known as the "woofer." In this case, the "woofer" is an actual dog, which is unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The term "woofer" usually refers to the low frequencies produced by a speaker, but in this context, it is a reference to the dog in the band. The joke is that the dog is not producing enough low frequencies, or bass tones.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "woofer" in this joke is a type of speaker, and not a dog. The person at the sound board is suggesting that there is less need for the animal sounds (coming from the speakers/woofers) because there are already so many animals in the studio playing instruments.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the word play between "woofer" (a type of loudspeaker) and "woof" (the sound a dog makes). The joke implies that the music being recorded in the studio is sub-par because there is not enough "woof" coming from the speakers, i.e., not enough bass.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is asking for less bass in the music, and "woofer" is another word for "bass." In other words, he's asking for less of the dog in the music, since the dog is playing the bass. This is a play on words because woof is the sound a dog makes.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: "woofer" is a type of speaker that produces low frequencies, i.e., bass. In this case, the joke is suggesting that there is less bass in the recording, i.e., that the dogs are not playing as much.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the sound engineer is saying that the "woofing" sound the dog is making is too loud, and he wants the dog to sing quieter. This is humorous because dogs cannot sing, so the engineer is inadvertently telling the dog to stop making dog noises.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "woofer" is a low-frequency speaker, so "less woofer" would mean less bass. However, in this case, the speaker is asking for less dog, as in, less of the animal, not the speaker. The joke is clever because it's a double meaning that only works in written form --- if it was just spoken, it would be confusing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The term "woofer" is a technical term for a type of loudspeaker, but it is also a word for a type of dog. In this context, the sound engineer is asking for less of the "woofer" sound, meaning less of the dog sound, but the joke is that he is actually asking for less of the loudspeaker sound.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the word "woofer," which is a type of speaker, and the word "woof," which is the sound that a dog makes. In the context of the cats and dogs playing music, the joke is that the dog is not playing well because he keeps making mistakes and barking instead of singing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because less woofer is a pun on the phrase "less water." In other words, the person controlling the sound in the studio is telling the animal singers to use less water, or in other words, to sing less loudly. This is a pun because "woof" is the sound that dogs make.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the sound engineer is saying that the music sounds like it has less bass, or "woofer." However, he is also saying that there are less dogs, which is why the music sounds different. This is a play on words, as the two phrases ("less woofer" and "less dogs") sound similar.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is asking for less bass in the music, and he is using a dog-related pun to do so. He is saying "less woofer," which is a play on the word "woofer," which is a type of speaker that emits bass. By saying "less woofer," he is saying that he wants less bass in the music.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="218.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="220.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
