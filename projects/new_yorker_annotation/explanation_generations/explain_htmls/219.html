In the situation, the caveman is worried about the person being attacked by the reptile, and so he says that he hopes that, in the future, people will be required to wear a plastic bracelet that would prevent them from being attacked by a reptile. However, the word "braces" can also mean "decorative metal pieces that are worn on the teeth." So, the joke is that the caveman is hoping for a future where people will have to wear metal braces on their teeth to prevent them from being attacked by a reptile.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to the movie "Jurassic Park." In that movie, the dinosaurs are brought back to life using DNA found in mosquito fossil. The characters in the movie have to wear bracelets that track their location so that they don't get lost in the park. The joke is clever because it uses the premise of the movie to make a comment about how ridiculous it is that the man's dream involved a dinosaur biting him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is currently being bitten by a dinosaur, which is a clear anachronism, and he is saying that he dreamt that something else that is anachronistic, small plastic bracelets, might become common in the future. This is funny because it's a double anachronism, and it's unlikely that either the dinosaurs or the bracelets will ever become common.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "I dreamt last night" sounds similar to "I dranked last night", which would imply that the person is talking about alcohol. However, the phrase is actually "I dreamt", meaning that the person was dreaming. This is relevant because the person was attacked by a reptile in their dream, which is a far more unusual situation than simply drinking alcohol. The joke is also a play on the fact that many people wear plastic bracelets to indicate that they are not drinking alcohol, as in a "braclet" or "drinking bracelet".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The caveman is saying that he dreamt that in the future, humans might have to wear small plastic bracelets to prove that they are not injured, in order to be able to receive medical care. The joke is amusing because it is a clever play on words, and because it is a likely scenario given the current state of the world's health care systems.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the idea of the 'society of the future.' In the joke, the man is saying that he dreamed last night that, in the future, people might have to wear a small plastic bracelet in order to prove that they are not dinosaurs. This is silly because, of course, there is no way to prove that someone is not a dinosaur, since they would have been extinct for millions of years. Furthermore, the idea that dinosaurs might exist in the present day is also absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in many countries, people who have been bitten by a poisonous snake or other reptile are required to wear a plastic bracelet that indicates they have been treated for the bite. The bracelet is a symbol that the person is no longer a danger to others, as they have been treated and are not infectious. However, in this caveman context, the fact that the person is still being attacked by the reptile makes the bracelet a farce.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's remark is clearly a non-sequitur. The man's dream of a future where judges require people to wear small plastic bracelets is unrelated to the dinosaur biting his leg in the present. The joke is humorous because it's absurd: not only is the man's comment random, but it's also something that could never happen, as there is no way to determine whether or not someone is wearing a bracelet without being able to see it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the small plastic bracelet is a way to prevent one from being bitten by a reptile. The fact that the caveman is dreaming that such a thing might exist implies that he is aware of the danger of being attacked by reptiles, but is powerless to do anything about it. The joke is a way of poking fun at the caveman's primitive lifestyle.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the Jurassic Park movie, where the scientists wear bracelets that allow them to enter and exit the dinosaur park. In the movie, the dinosaurs bite a man's leg off; in this situation, the man is having a dream that in the future, judges might require people to wear bracelets to protect them from dinosaurs in the same way that the scientists did in Jurassic Park.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "I have a dream." The person who said this joke was probably thinking about the famous speech by Martin Luther King Jr., which began with the phrase "I have a dream." Instead of a dream, this person is saying they had a dream last night, which makes it seem like a less significant dream. But the dream they are referring to is actually a small, plastic bracelet. This is a clever way of making fun of the phrase "I have a dream," which is often used to describe someone's hopes and aspirations for the future.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in order to be a judge in the modern day, one has to have a law degree and be sworn in. However, in the time of cavemen, there were no laws or even a written language, so the idea of a caveman becoming a judge is absurd. The joke is even funnier because the punchline is something that is required in the modern day to become a judge (a small plastic bracelet that says "I am a judge"), but would have been completely irrelevant in the time of cavemen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on how, in some cultures, it is customary for men to give their wife a small plastic bracelet to show that they are married. In this case, the woman is giving the man a bracelet to show that he has been bitten by a reptile and is now bleeding. The joke is clever because it is a play on how a small, innocuous object like a bracelet can have a lot of meaning depending on the context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The person who was attacked by the reptile has a bracelet around their ankle, which is a common item people wear. The bracelet might be there for a number of reasons, but the joke is implying that the bracelet is there to warn others that the person has been attacked by a reptile, and thus has a potentially dangerous disease.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because cavemen have no concept of time, so the idea of a "last night" doesn't make sense. Furthermore, the idea that a judge in the future would require a small plastic bracelet is absurd because it's something that would never happen.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="218.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="220.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
