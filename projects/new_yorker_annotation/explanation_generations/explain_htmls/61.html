The phrase "your table is ready" is commonly used at restaurants to let a customer know that their seat is open and ready for them to sit down. However, in this situation, the wise man is saying that the person will only know when they are ready to leave this world and move on to the next. The fact that the scene looks like a restaurant makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the setting is a restaurant, but the wise man at the top of the cliff is saying something that doesn't make sense in that context. In a restaurant, "your table is ready" means that a table has been prepared for you and that you can now sit down to eat. However, the wise man is saying that only the explorer will know when he is ready, which doesn't make sense in the context of a restaurant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the explorer has reached the "top" of the mountain, but the "top" is also a table in a restaurant. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the common saying, "Only you will know when you're ready." In this case, the explorer is told that he won't know when his table is ready, meaning that he won't know when he's reached the top of the mountain.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man at the top of the cliff is a wise man, but he is telling the explorer a seemingly nonsensical statement. However, upon further reflection, the statement is true: only the explorer will know when he or she is ready to face the challenges ahead. The joke is clever because it is true and deep, but is also initially seeming like a non-sequitur.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is wise man at the top of the mountain is telling the explorer that he will know when it is time for him to leave, and the explorer replies with a joke about how he will know when his table is ready. The joke is clever because it is true: the explorer will know when it is time to leave when his table is ready, i.e., when he has finished his meal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the punchline is a non-sequitur. The wise man at the top of the cliff is telling the explorer that he will only know when his table is ready, i.e., when he's ready to die, when he looks inside himself. But the people in the background are at tables in a restaurant, so the punchline could also mean that the explorer will only know his table is ready when he sees an empty seat at the restaurant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The monk is saying that only the mountain climber will know when it's time for him to "dine" (i.e., die), because in climbing the mountain, he will face many dangers. The other people at the tables are already dead, so they don't have to worry about when their "table is ready."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the monk is telling the mountain climber that he will only know when his table is "ready" (i.e., when he dies and goes to heaven) when he dies. The joke is a play on words because "table" can mean both a physical object that you eat on, as well as a figurative "place" where you go when you die. The monk is saying that the climber will only find out the latter when he dies.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it conflates the concept of a table at a restaurant with the concept of a mountaintop. The wise man is telling the explorer that he will know when he has reached the top of the mountain, just as the explorer will know when his table is ready at a restaurant. The joke plays on the fact that both concepts are of physical spaces where one must wait to be seated.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the explorer has reached the top of the cliff, he still has to wait for a table. The sage wisdom of the man is that, even though the explorer has reached his goal, he will still have to wait for what he wants. The point is that, even when you reach your goals, you can't always get what you want right away.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man at the top of the cliff is giving a deep and sage-like advice, but the advice is actually just a play on the restaurant trope where people are told their table will be ready "in 5-10 minutes." In this case, the advice is that only the explorer will know when he is truly ready to face the challenges ahead, which is a more profound statement than the restaurant advice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "your table is ready" is most often used in the context of a restaurant, when a patron's food is ready and they can come sit down to eat. However, in this context, the phrase takes on a different meaning: the explorer has reached the top of the cliff, and the wise man is telling him that only he will know when he is ready to come down and join the others at the table.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The explorer has reached the "top" of the mountain, and the wise man tells him that only he will know when his "table" is ready. This is a play on the fact that, in a restaurant, one must usually wait for a table to be free before they can be seated. Here, the explorer has reached the "top" of the mountain, and can now be said to have their "table" (i.e., their goal) ready.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "only you will know when you're ready." The monk is saying that the mountain climber will know when it's his "table" (i.e., turn) to eat dinner because he will be the one climbing the mountain. The joke is clever because it's both a play on words and a pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully mixes the expectations of a restaurant with the reality of a cliff-side. In a restaurant, you expect to be seated at a table, provided one is available, but the wise man is telling the explorer that there is no guarantee a table will be available, and even if one is, only the explorer will know when it's ready. The joke is a play on words, as "table" can refer to both a flat surface to put things on, as well as a seating area in a restaurant.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="60.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="62.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
