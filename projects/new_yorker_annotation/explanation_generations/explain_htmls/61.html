The joke is also funny because it is a play on words: "jolly" can mean both happy/friendly, as in the Jolly Green Giant's usual demeanor, and large/giant, as in his physical size. The joke is thus that the Giant is too big (literally) to be jolly (in the friendly sense).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Jolly Green Giant is supposed to be a gentle giant, but in this scene he is attacking everything. The man and woman watching from above are probably the parents of the Jolly Green Giant, and the joke is that they are saying that his jolliness must have skipped a generation, i.e., he's not supposed to be like this.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Jolly Green Giant is supposed to be a friendly, jolly character. However, in this scene, he is attacking everything in sight. The joke suggests that the Jolly Green Giant's ancestor was not so jolly, and that the current generation of Jolly Green Giants is more like their ancestor than they are like the original Jolly Green Giant.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="60.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="62.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
