This is a play on the fact that often, public speakers will start their talk by saying thank you to the audience for having them. In this case, the baby is the one who should be grateful for the opportunity to speak, but because it's a baby, the tables are turned.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of a baby being a public speaker. It's not something that you would expect a baby to do. The joke is also funny because of the way that babies talk. They often talk in a high-pitched voice, which makes it even funnier to imagine a baby being a public speaker.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is absurd to imagine a baby giving a speech. However, the fact that the baby is wearing a suit makes it clear that he is in a professional setting, which makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that babies often thank their parents for having them (i.e., giving birth to them). In this case, the baby is standing in his crib giving a speech as if he is a stand-up comedian, and thanks his parents for having him. The joke is also clever because it's a double entendre --- the baby is both thanking his parents for giving birth to him, and also thanking them for the opportunity to give his speech.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because even though the baby can't talk, the parents are pretending that the baby is a public speaker. This is humorous because public speakers are often nervous or anxious before they start talking, and the idea of a baby being nervous is amusing. Additionally, the joke is also a play on words, because the baby is technically starting off by saying "thanks" into the microphone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the disparity between the expectation of what a baby would say, which would be something like "goo goo ga ga," and the reality of what this baby is saying, which is a whole, coherent sentence. Additionally, the fact that the baby is wearing a suit adds to the humor, as it's unexpected and formal attire for such a young child.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the baby, despite being very young and not possessing the cognitive ability to speak, is giving a speech into the mic as if it was a seasoned public speaker. This is made even funnier by the fact that the baby is saying something that public speakers often say at the beginning of their speeches. The joke implies that the baby is a natural born public speaker, despite its age and inexperience.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that babies often startle their parents by suddenly sitting up or standing up in their cribs. In this case, the baby is standing up in his crib giving a speech, which is even more unexpected. The joke is made funnier by the fact that the baby is wearing a suit, as if he's a stand-up comedian or a politician.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common saying "break a leg", which is a way of wishing good luck to a performer before they go on stage. In this instance, the baby in the crib is the performer, and the mic is their stage. The joke is clever because, even though babies can't talk, they can still technically break a leg, which is an injury.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the baby, who can't talk, is supposedly thanks the parents for the opportunity to perform. The joke is clever because it takes a situation which is clearly not unusual (a baby in its crib) and subverts the expectations by adding an unusual element (the microphone) to create a humorous scenario.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The baby is "starting off" by saying thanks, but really, the baby is just making cooing noises into the microphone. The joke would only make sense if the baby were actually doing a stand-up comedy routine, which is why it's funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is incongruous: public speaking is typically an activity engaged in by adults, not babies. The joke is clever because it plays on the fact that often, the opening line of a speech is some version of "thank you for having me here today," which makes it seem like the baby is giving a formal speech.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the baby, who couldn't possibly have said the opening line of a stand-up comedy act, is giving a stand-up comedy act. This is humorous because, in order to be a stand-up comedian, one needs to be articulate and have material, neither of which a baby has.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of a baby using a microphone. Microphones are typically used by public speakers, and babies aren't known for their eloquence. The joke would be even funnier if the baby started speaking in tongues or saying profanities.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to a common stand-up comedy trope, where a comedian will thank the audience for coming to see them. However, in this case, the baby is the one giving the speech, and he is thanking his parents for having him. This is funny because it's reversal of the power dynamic: usually, it's the parents who have the baby, but in this case, it's the baby who has the parents.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="60.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="62.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
