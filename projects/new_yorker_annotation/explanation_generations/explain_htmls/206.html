A "male" can refer to a gender, as in "male executive," but it can also be short for "manual," as in a "male plug." In this case, the executives are expecting a male executive to join their meeting, but instead a man in a suit shows up and does a cannonball into the meeting table. The joke is clever because it works on multiple levels: not only is the man in a suit unexpectedly doing a cannonball, but he is also unexpectedly interrupting the meeting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. In this context, "incoming" is usually used to mean a message or memo that is being sent to someone, but in this case, it means that a man is literally incoming, as in he is about to dive into the meeting. The fact that the people in the meeting assumed that the memo was just a typo is what makes it funny because it is a reasonable mistake to make.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person cannonballing into the room is a man, and the people in the room were expecting a man (as in, a human), but they assumed it was a typo. The contrast between the expected man and the actual man (a human vs. a human cannonball) is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the suit is "incoming" in the sense that he is coming in to the room, but he is also incoming in the sense that he is cannonballing onto the table. The executives in the room had assumed that the memo was referring to a man coming in, but they were wrong --- it was actually referring to a cannonball.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's diving into the meeting is so unexpected and out-of-place that the people in the meeting assume that it must be a mistake. This is a play on the phrase "expect the unexpected", which is often used when warning people about things that could go wrong.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people in the meeting are so surprised by the man cannonballing into the meeting that they believe it was a typo instead of an actual warning. The joke is clever because it uses the double-meaning of the word "incoming": in this context, it can mean either "arriving" or "approaching", so the people in the meeting thought it was a typo for "incoming mail".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people in the meeting are surprised by the man cannonballing into the room, even though the memo they received said to expect him. The typo in the memo was "incoming male," which they assumed was a typo for "incoming mail." However, the man cannonballing into the room is an actual person, not mail. The contrast between the expectation of mail and the reality of a human being is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the suit is cannonballing onto the meeting table, which is unexpected and disruptive. The other executives probably assumed that the memo about an incoming male was a typo, and that it was supposed to say "incoming mail".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is unexpected and confusing. The people in the meeting thought that the memo that said "expect incoming male" was a typo, but it actually meant that a man would be cannonballing into the meeting. This confusion leads to the humorous situation of a man cannonballing into a meeting room full of people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men in the meeting are surprised by the cannonballing man, because they thought the memo which said "expect incoming male" was a typo, and that it was supposed to say "expected incoming mail". The fact that a man cannonballed into the meeting instead of mail being delivered is unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the scene plays off the trope of businesspeople taking everything very literally. In this case, the people in the meeting assumed that the memo about an incoming person had made a typo and that it should have said "incoming mail" instead of "incoming male." However, the cannonballing man interrupts the meeting, proving that it was not a typo after all.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the phrase "incoming male" is often used to refer to an expectant father, i.e., a man who is about to have a baby. However, in this case, the man cannonballing into the meeting is not an expectant father, but rather, just a man. The confusion over the meaning of "incoming male" is funny because it's a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the executives are expecting a business representative from another company (the "incoming male"), but instead, a man shows up and does a cannonball into the board room table. The mismatch between the expectation and reality is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a common business meeting protocol is for everyone to wait for the "incoming" person before starting the meeting. In this case, the incoming person is a man who literally cannonballs into the meeting room, which is unexpected and chaotic. The joke is clever because it plays on the double meaning of the word "incoming" --- normally, it refers to a person arriving, but in this case, it refers to the man cannonballing into the room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the workers in the meeting expected a businessman to come in and give a presentation --- not a man literally cannonballing into the meeting room. The mix-up occurs because the memo they received said to expect an "incoming male", which they assumed was a typo for "incoming mail".</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
