The doctor is using a stethoscope, which is a common medical instrument, to listen to the man's heartbeat. However, the stethoscope is also picking up the man's cell phone signal, which is unexpected. The joke is clever because it's a pun on the word "signal" --- in this context, a "signal" can mean either a heartbeat or a cell phone signal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is holding a stethoscope, which is used to listen to heartbeats and other internal sounds, to a man walking next to him.
