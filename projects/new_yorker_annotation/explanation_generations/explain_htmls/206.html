The question is meant to gauge a person's ability to think on their feet and handle difficult situations, but it's humorous to imagine two people in straightjackets trying to have an interview.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the standard interview question "tell me about a time when you were in a difficult situation and what you did to resolve it." The joke is funny because the situation the interviewees are currently in (being in straight jackets) is a difficult one, and it's ironic that the question is being asked in that context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The term "stray jacket" can mean two things: either a physical garment that one puts on, or a figurative way of saying that someone is out of their element or out of their mind. In this case, the people in the room are literally wearing straitjackets, which are a type of physical garment designed to restrain someone's movement, usually because they are considered to be a danger to themselves or others. The joke is that they are in a straitjacket, which is a difficult situation, and they are being asked to describe how they got out of a difficult situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common interview question "Tell me about a time when you were in a difficult situation and how you handled it." The joke is made funnier by the fact that the women are in straightjackets, which implies that they have difficulty handling themselves in general.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people in the room are in straitjackets, which are restrictive and make it difficult to move. They are in a meeting, which is usually a formal setting, but their clothing choice (straitjackets) makes it appear as if they are not taking the meeting seriously. The interviewer is asking a common interview question, but the fact that the interviewees are in straitjackets makes it difficult for them to answer the question.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common interview question "tell me about a time when you were in a difficult situation and how you handled it." However, in this case, the interviewers are in straitjackets, which implies that they are the ones who were in a difficult situation, and they had to put themselves in straitjackets to get out of it. This is a clever reversal of the typical interview question.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "a difficult situation" can mean both a situation that was hard to manage/get out of, or a physical location that is hard to escape from, like a straitjacket. The joke is that the two people in the room are in a straitjacket, and the interview question is about a difficult situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on a common interview question, "Tell me about a time when you were in a difficult situation and what you did to get out of it." The question is usually asked to gauge a person's problem-solving skills, but in this instance, it's absurd because both women are in straight-jackets and thus confined. The question becomes moot since they can't demonstrate their problem-solving skills under these circumstances.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a standard interview question, but in this context, it's unusual because the two interviewees are both in straight jackets. This means that they have both been in difficult situations and have had to use their wits and strength to get out of them, which makes them qualified for the job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non sequitur. The two people in the office are in a difficult situation because they are both tied up in straight jackets, but the interviewer is asking about a different difficult situation. The contrast between the two situations is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people in the scene are wearing straitjackets, which are usually associated with difficult situations or mental illness. The person asking the question is interviewing the other person for a job, and the fact that they are both in straitjackets implies that the person asking the question is also in a difficult situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the interview question, "Tell me about a time when you were in a difficult situation." The situation depicted is, clearly, a difficult one: the women are in straightjackets and, presumably, not in the office by choice. The joke depends on the assumption that the person being interviewed is not in a position to choose whether or not to be in the office, which is a difficult situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words; when someone is "in a straitjacket," it means they are in a difficult or impossible situation. So, when the person asks the other person to tell them about a difficult situation they've been in, the person in the straitjacket is actually in the most difficult situation imaginable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a common interview question, but in this case it's humorous because the two women are in straightjackets. It's difficult to imagine a more difficult situation than being restrained in a straightjacket, so the question becomes ironic. Furthermore, the fact that they are in an office setting makes the scene even more absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two women in straightjackets are in a difficult situation, and the interviewer is asking about a difficult situation. The interviewer is unaware of the difficulties of the situation, and is only focused on the competency of the interviewee.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="205.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="207.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
