The phrase is typically used to describe a situation where someone is entertained by what's happening around them, and they don't need television because real life is more exciting. In this case, the situation is much more violent and dangerous than anything that could be found on TV, so the phrase takes on a new, ironic meaning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "cable" can mean two things: a physical TV cord, or a lot of exciting action happening (as in, "there's a lot of cable TV happening right now"). In this case, the waiters are having a conversation while there's a lot of "cable TV" (action) happening in the form of a chef chase. So, the joke is that the waiters don't need cable TV because they're already getting plenty of entertainment from the kitchen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "this is why I don't need cable TV", which is often said by people who prefer to spend their time doing other activities rather than watch television. In this case, the person is saying it because the scene in the kitchen is so crazy that it's more entertaining than anything on television.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur. The joke-teller is trying to make light of the situation by making a joke, but the joke itself doesn't make sense in relation to the situation. The fact that the joke is a non-sequitur makes it funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "I don't need cable TV" is often used to describe how someone doesn't need entertainment because they find entertainment in other things. In this case, the waiter doesn't need cable TV because the scene in the kitchen is more entertaining than anything he would find on TV.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is implying that the entertainment value of the chefs chasing each other with a knife and the viola player is equivalent to that of cable TV. The joke is clever because it's true --- often, people find more entertainment in real life than they do from watching TV.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non-sequitur. Thewaiter is talking about how he doesn't need cable TV because he has all the entertainment he needs right here in the kitchen, where there is a chef attempting to murder another chef. This is unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the waiters are having a normal conversation, the scene behind them is very chaotic, with a chef chasing another chef with a knife. The joke is saying that the waiters don't need to watch TV, because the scene in the kitchen is more entertaining than anything on TV.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "this is why we can't have nice things." In this case, the phrase is used to explain why someone doesn't need cable TV, because the chaos in the kitchen is more interesting than anything that could be on TV.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a Chef vs. Chef kitchen fight, which is strangely reminiscent of a television show or movie. The fact that it's happening in real life, and that one of the parties is playing a viola, makes it even more surreal and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is casually making an observation about the situation in the kitchen, as if it's a usual occurrence. The fact that the situation is actually very strange and dangerous makes the joke funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur: in response to seeing the chaotic scene in the kitchen, the speaker says that they don't need cable TV. The joke is funny because it's a unexpected, and unrelated, response to the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the waiters are having a normal conversation, the chefs in the background are doing something incredibly strange. The waiter says that he doesn't need cable TV, because the bizarre events happening in the kitchen are more entertaining than any TV show could ever be.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non sequitur. The two waiters are discussing the chef's murder, and one of them makes a comment about how he doesn't need cable TV because he has enough entertainment in his life. This is a absurd because the TV has nothing to do with the chef's murder, and it's a very random thing to say in the middle of a conversation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "I don't need cable TV because I have the internet." The internet is a source of entertainment, and in this situation, the entertainment is provided by a real life kitchen drama unfolding before the speaker's eyes.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="222.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="224.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
