If it's a boy, we'll call him Boy. But if it's a girl I want to call her McKenzie.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. If the couple has a boy, they will literally call him "Boy," but if they have a girl, they will call her "McKenzie." This is a play on the phrase "What's in a name?" which is often used to mean that a name doesn't matter, but in this case, the name does matter because it's a girl's name.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The name "Tarzan" is associated with the jungle, and one of the animals often found in the jungle is the monkey. So, the husband is saying that if they have a boy, they will name him after himself, but if they have a girl, they will name her after the monkey. The joke is also a play on the idea that girls are often named after their fathers, while boys are named after their mother's maiden name.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The first part is a reference to the common male given name "Boy," which is often used as a name for a son in Tarzan-type stories. The second part is a play on the phrase "If it's a boy, we'll call him John," which is a way of saying that the child's name will be John if it's a boy. But in this case, the woman says that she will name the child McKenzie if it's a girl, making it a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The usual naming convention for children is to name them after either their father, their mother, or a family member. However, in this situation, because Tarzan and Jane are both looking at something (presumably their child), they might name the baby after what they see. In this case, if it's a boy, they'll name him "Boy," and if it's a girl, they'll name her "McKenzie," after the McKenzie River in Oregon.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man, Tarzan, is trying to name their child based on the first letter of the gender. So if it's a boy, he wants to name the child "Boy," and if it's a girl, he wants to name the child "McKenzie." This is funny because it's a very simple way of thinking about gender and names, and it's not usually how people name their children.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it subverts the typical naming conventions for children. If the baby is a boy, they will just name him "Boy," which is a very simple and straightforward name. However, if it's a girl, they want to give her a more complicated and pretentious name, "McKenzie." This is likely because Tarzan is a very simple and straightforward character, while Jane is more complicated and pretentious.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The couple is discussing names for their child, and the man says that if it's a boy, they will just name him "Boy." This is a common name for boys in the UK, but it's also a word that can be used to describe a male child.Similarly, the woman says that if it's a girl, she wants to name her McKenzie. McKenzie is a common Scottish name, but it's also a word that can be used to describe a female child.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at the fact that often in Tarzan movies/stories, the female lead is given a more civilized name (e.g. Jane) while the male lead keeps his more natural name (e.g. Tarzan). In this joke, the woman wants toCall her baby a name that isn't as natural sounding as the man's name, which suggests that she is more in touch with her civilized side.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In this scene, it's not clear what the thing is that Tarzan and Jane are looking at; however, if it's a baby, then the joke makes sense. If it's a girl, they would call her McKenzie, which is a similar sounding name to "monkey." This would be funny because it would be a play on the fact that Tarzan is often associated with monkeys.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The first part of the sentence, "Fine. If it's a boy, we'll call him Boy," is a straightforward statement. However, the second part, "But if it's a girl I want to call her McKenzie," is a pun. The word "call" can mean to name, as in "What should we call the baby?" but it can also mean to yell, as in "I'm going to call for help!" In this context, the caller is McKenzie, the girl, suggesting that she will be the one who needs help, not the boy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on Tarzan's famous line "Me Tarzan, you Jane." In this version, Tarzan is discussing names for their child, and he wants to name their son "Boy" if it's a boy, because that's his name. However, if it's a girl, he wants to name her "McKenzie," which is Jane's name. This joke is a play on how Tarzan and Jane are usually depicted as having very simple names.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The first part is a common joke where someone asks what they will name their child if they don't know the gender, and the second part is a play on the fact that McKenzie is a girl's name. What makes it funny is that the couple is in a jungle, surrounded by animals, and they are talking about potentially naming their child after one of the animals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it suggests that Tarzan and Jane are fighting over what to name their child, with Tarzan wanting a more traditional name like "Boy" and Jane wanting a more modern name like "McKenzie." The irony is that, in the original story, Jane is the more civilized one and Tarzan is the one who was raised by apes, so it's funny that Jane is the one pushing for a modern name.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, if the couple is naming their child after where they found him/her (i.e., "Boy"), then the boy's name would literally just be "Boy." However, if they have a girl, they want to name her something more feminine and traditional, like "McKenzie." This is a play on the fact that, often, couples will have a boy and then a girl, and so they will use more traditional names for the girl because they didn't use them for the boy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of "call": in one sense, to "call" a baby is to give them a name; in another sense, when animals or birds "call" to each other, they are making noises to communicate. In this case, the woman wants to name the child McKenzie, but the man wants to name the child "Boy" because that's what you would typically call a baby animal. However, the woman's point is that if it's a girl, then they should give her a name, not just make noises at her.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
