Can I interest you in some promotional material about intelligent design?</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is completely naked, which would normally be considered inappropriate in most situations. He is also trying to give the fish a piece of paper, which is also strange. The fact that he is doing this all while being naked makes the situation even more absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the naked man is trying to sell the fish a book about intelligent design, which is the idea that some natural phenomena or objects are too complex or too intricate to have arisen through natural selection and evolution. This is ironic because the man, who is naked and has just kicked a fish up a hill, is himself not very intelligent.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is interested in the fish, but the fish is not interested in the man. The man is also naked, which could be interpreted as him being "exposed" or "vulnerable." The joke is clever because it's a double entendre --- the man is both literally and figuratively exposed.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="222.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="224.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
