The therapist is project her own issues onto the banana peel, which is a common method of defense used by people in therapy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The therapist is asking the banana peel what is wrong, and why it is feeling down. However, the therapist is also asking the banana peel what is wrong in a literal sense - as in, what is causing the banana peel to rot.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully suggests that the therapist is cannibalistic and wants to eat her patient. The banana peel on the couch could be interpreted as a phallic symbol, adding another layer to the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the psychologist is trying to start a conversation with the banana. This is silly because the banana is, of course, not alive and cannot talk. The joke may also be a play on the phrase "what's eating you," which is often used to ask someone what is wrong or bothering them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of the word "eating." In this context, "eating" can mean to consume, as in "eating a banana," but it can also mean to be anxious or worried about something, as in "what's eating you?" By saying "let's talk about what's eating you," the therapist is implying that the banana is the cause of the patient's anxiety, which is of course not the case.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully ignores the fact that there is an obvious distractions in the room --- a banana peel on the couch. The joke also cleverly re-purposes the therapist's "usual" line --- "Now that you've opened up, let's talk about what's bothering you" --- to be about the banana peel, which is a more light-hearted issue than whatever the therapist was originally expecting to discuss with a patient.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is trying to get the banana peel to talk about its feelings, even though banana peels don't have feelings. The therapist is either trying to be funny or she's genuinely misunderstanding the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Banana is a phallic symbol, and the therapist is making a joke about what is "eating" the banana. This is a play on words, because the Banana is being eaten by whoever is sitting on the couch, but it is also a symbol for a penis, which is often "eaten" during sex. The therapist is also making a pun about the patient "opening up," which is a common phrase in therapy, meaning to discuss one's feelings honestly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is trying to engage with the imaginary patient by suggesting that they talk about what is bothering them. However, the fact that there is a banana on the couch suggests that the therapist herself is the one who is bothered by something, namely, the banana peel. Thus, the therapist is project her own issues onto the nonexistent patient.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. In this context, "what's eating you" means "what's bothering you," but it could also be interpreted to mean "what's consuming you." In the latter interpretation, the therapist is asking the banana what's consuming it, which is a funny way of looking at things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of the phrase "what's eating you": in this context, the therapist is asking the banana what is causing it distress, but the phrase can also mean "what's bothering you?" or "what's on your mind?". The fact that the therapist is literalizing the phrase and asking the banana what is causing it distress is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it play off the fact that therapist sometimes use the phrase "let's talk about what's eating you" as a metaphor for finding out what's making a person upset. In this case, the therapist is taking the phrase literally, because she is talking to a banana peel, which can't actually be eaten because it's not food.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is talking to the banana peel as if it were a patient. The therapist is trying to get the banana peel to talk about its problems, but of course, the banana peel can't talk. The joke is silly because it's impossible for a banana peel to have any kind of emotional issue that it needs to talk about.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is play on words. When someone is "eating a banana," they are consuming the fruit, but "what's eating you" is a phrase often used to ask someone what is bothering them emotionally. In this case, the therapist is asking the banana peel what is bothering it emotionally, which of course, is not possible because it is not a living thing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the literal meaning of the phrase "what's eating you." In this context, the psychiatrist is asking her patient about the root cause of their issues, but the joke is that there literal root cause is a banana.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="93.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="95.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
