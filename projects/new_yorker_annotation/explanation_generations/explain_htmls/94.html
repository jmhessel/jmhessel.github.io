The flooring company made a mistake and instead of red tiles, they put in rep-tiles, which are tiles that have been used before (and are therefore cheaper). The alligator coming up through the floor is aresult of the company's mistake, and the woman is making a joke about it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Red tiles" and "rep-tiles" sound similar, but they have different meanings. Red tiles would normally be used for flooring, but rep-tiles are used for reptiles. In other words, the flooring company made a mistake and sent them the wrong type of tiles. As a result, there's an alligator in their restaurant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully pokes at the woman's reaction to the alligator. In the context of the joke, the woman's terror is irrational because the alligator is not actually coming for her: it is just a harmless (albeit unusual) animal. The joke is clever because it takes a real-world anxiety (being afraid of alligators) and pairs it with a more innocuous situation (an alligator in a restaurant) to create a humorous contrast.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is absurd: an alligator is coming out of the floor of a restaurant, and the waiter is calmly explaining that it's just a misunderstanding with the flooring company. The absurdity of the situation is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In this situation, the woman is in a restaurant, and the waiter is pointing out an alligator coming up from a hole in the floor. The alligator is red, and the woman mistakes it for a reptile. The joke is funny because it's a play on the word "reptile" and the fact that the alligator is red.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the idea of autocorrect errors leading to funny or embarrassing results. In this case, the woman is trying to explain away the alligator by saying that it's just a red tile that the restaurant's flooring company made a mistake on. The alligator is still there, however, making the explanation less convincing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is surprised by the alligator, but the waiter is calm and matter-of-fact. He explains that they had simply asked for red tiles for the floor, but the company had autocorrected it to reptile tiles, which is why there is an alligator in the restaurant. This explanation is funny because it's a very simple mistake that led to a very unusual situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the close similarity between the words "red" and "rep," which are both common words in the English language. When the flooring company autocorrected the word "red" to "rep," they didn't realize that it would result in an alligator coming out of the floor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people in the restaurant are staring at an alligator coming out of the floor. The alligator is likely there because the flooring company made a mistake and put in red tiles instead of rep-tiles (a type of flooring that looks like scales, which is what an alligator has). The joke is a play on words, as the two types of tiles sound similar.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The alligator coming out of the floor is a reptile, which is often called a "rep-tile." The fact that the flooring company made a mistake and sent the wrong tiles is surprising, but the alligator coming out of the floor is even more surprising.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The flooring company was supposed to put in red tiles, but instead they put in rep-tiles, which are tiles that look like reptiles. The alligator coming up through the hole in the floor is a result of the company's mistake.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it puns on the phrase "red tiles" and the word "reptiles." In this situation, the alligator coming from the floor is unexpected and unwelcome, so the woman is making a joke about how it must have been a mistake by the company that installed the flooring.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The flooring company was supposed to install red tiles, but they installed tiles that look like reptile skin instead. The woman in the restaurant is now being surprise by an alligator coming up through the floor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is asks the waiter about the alligator, and he tells her that they actually asked for red tiles for the floor, but the company autocorrected it to reptile tiles. This is amusing because it's an unlikely but possible story, and it's a clever way to make the alligator less intrusive in the restaurant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter is trying to make a joke about how the alligator in the room is a result of a typo, but it's not a very good joke. The fact that he is making a joke at all is surprising given the situation, but the fact that it's such a terrible joke makes it even funnier.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="93.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="95.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
