The waiter asks if the woman and man want anything to drink, and the man replies "Yes, three martinis please." This could be interpreted as meaning that the man wants three martinis for himself, or that he wants one martini each for himself and the woman, plus an extra martini. However, given the context of the joke (the dangerous situation they are in), the most likely interpretation is that the man wants three martinis for himself, and the woman is not with him. This joke is funny because it is a clever play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to the movie "The Three Musketeers", where one of the characters famously says "All for one, and one for all." In the movie, the three musketeers are all friends and are willing to help each other out. However, in this situation, the woman is sitting alone at the table, implying that the two men (presumably her friends) have fallen off the ledge. The joke is funny because it is a dark twist on a classic movie line.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "three of you": in a normal scenario, the waiter would be asking if there are three people in the party so that he can bring enough menus. However, in this context, the waiter is referring to the fact that there are three people on the ledge of the building: two at the table, and himself. The joke is clever because it's a play on words, but also because it's a visual gag.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="93.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="95.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
