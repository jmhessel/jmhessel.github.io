The first meaning is that the beaver is going to go see what is causing the tree to remain suspended in the air, even though it has been cut through. The second meaning is that the beaver is going to go see what is causing the other beaver to continue to try to cut through the tree, even though it is clear that it is not going to work.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because both beavers are completely perplexed as to why the tree they have cut down isn't falling. The one beaver is leaving to go try to find an answer, while the other beaver is staying behind to investigate. This is silly because, even if the beavers did know why the tree wasn't falling, there's nothing they could do to fix the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the beaver has cut through the entire tree and it's still not falling. The beaver is confused and decides to go see what's holding the tree up, not realizing that the tree is being held up by its own wood.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="158.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="160.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
