In this case, the "company" being taken over is the man's body, and the other office workers in the background are presumably witnesses to or complicit in the takeover.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. A "hostile takeover" is normally used to describe a business takeover where the managers of the company being taken over are opposed to the takeover. In this case, the man in the stocks is opposed to the takeover, but he is also literally being held hostage by the new owners.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. In a business context, a "hostile takeover" is when one company tries to buy out another company without the approval of the company's management. In this context, the man in the stocks is the company, and the woman and man are the hostile takeover artists. The joke is clever because it is literally true: the man is in stocks (a physical punishment device), and he is being taken over (by the two people walking into the office).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. A "hostile takeover" is when a company is taken over by another company against the wishes of the company's management. In this case, the woman has taken over the man's office by putting him in stocks, which is a type of physical restraint.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually, when there is a hostile takeover of a business, the employees are given a certain amount of time to clear out their desks and leave the premises. In this case, the workers are being physical restrained and are unable to leave, which is a comedic exaggeration of a hostile takeover.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "hostile takeover" is a term used in business to describe a hostile takeover bid: an attempt by one company to take over another company. Here, the joke is that the man in the stocks is the victim of a literal hostile takeover: the woman and man who came in probably held him against his will and put him in the stocks.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the stocks are usually associated with a more medieval time period, and the business-like clothing of the people in the scene implies a more modern setting. The joke is a play on words, as the word "hostile" can mean both unfriendly/aggressive and taken over by another company. In this context, the word "takeover" refers to the act of one company acquiring another, usually through a hostile takeover.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. A "hostile takeover" usually refers to a business acquisition where the managers of the company being acquired resist the takeover attempt. In this case, the office worker who has been "taken over" is literally in a physical restraints, making it a "hostile takeover" in the most literal sense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in business, a hostile takeover is when a company is bought out by another company without the consent of the original company's management. In this case, the man is saying that the acquisition of the office worker in the stockade was a very hostile takeover, which is humorous because it's not the typical usage of the phrase.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in stocks is usually associated with a more medieval time period. However, the joke updates this to a modern office setting, which makes the scene more absurd. The fact that the other two people are walking into the office casually as if this is a normal occurrence makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. A hostile takeover is when a company is taken over by another company against its will, usually for financial reasons. In this case, the man has been taken over by the stockade, which is a physical restraint, against his will. Thus, the joke is a clever way to describe the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "hostile" can describe a takeover that was not friendly or consensual, but in this case, the man is literally being hostile, because he is taking over the other office worker's body.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "hostile takeover" is usually a metaphor for a business takeover --- i.e., when one company tries to buy out or takeover another company. In this case, the "hostile takeover" is literal: the man has taken the woman hostage and is holding her against her will in the office.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the image: in a business setting, executives and employees are typically suited up in formal clothing and engage in white-collar work; by contrast, the man in stocks is a more medieval form of physical restraint, often used as punishment. The joke suggests that the recent takeover of the company was so hostile, the victors didn't even bother to take the time to change out of their rough, medieval clothing before coming in to gloat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in the business world, a hostile takeover is when one company buys out another (usually smaller) company, against the wishes of the management of the company being taken over. This is typically done by force, through a hostile takeover bid: in this scenario, the person in stocks is the former CEO of the company that was taken over, and the people walking in are the new owners. The joke is clever because it plays on the double meaning of the word "hostile": in the business world, a hostile takeover is a hostile act, but in this physical world, the stocks are a physical restraint, making the person unable to move.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="158.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="160.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
