In this case, the umpire is asked the question in the middle of a game, and the answer is obviously "no." The joke is a play on words, as the umpire is not better off now than he was four innings ago because he is not on the ground where he should be.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on US President Ronald Reagan's famous line "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?" The man behind the podium is acting like a game show host, and the boys playing baseball are the contestants. However, instead of four years, the time frame is four innings --- in other words, not very long at all. This joke is a way of pointing out how US presidents often make grandiose claims that aren't always true.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common phrase "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?" which is often used in elections. In this situation, the umpire is asking the batter if he is doing better now than he was four innings ago, which is a much shorter time frame. This joke would only make sense if the batter had been doing poorly up until that point, and the umpire is trying to point out how bad he's doing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?" which is a common campaign slogan. In this case, the joke is pointing out how the game has dragged on, and how the result is still in question, just like how the four years under a particular political administration can be seen as a wash.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the umpire is making a political statement from his perch above the field. This is a play on the well-known phrase "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?" which is often used in election years. The fact that the umpire is speaking from a high vantage point gives his statement more weight, as if he is judging the players from on high.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the famous campaign slogan of U.S. President Ronald Reagan, "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?" The relevant wikipedia article is: wiki/Ronald_Reagan. In the context of a baseball game, the joke is either asking if the batter is doing better than he was four innings ago (in terms of number of hits, runs scored, etc.), or if the team is ahead or behind by more runs than they were four innings ago.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common political question, "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?" which is often asked during election years. The fact that the question is asked during a baseball game, where the score is reset to 0 every four innings, implies that the politician (or, in this case, the umpire) doesn't actually care about how people are doing, and is only interested in rhetoric.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the politician is using a line that is typically associated with economic situations, but he is using it in reference to the baseball game. The game has four innings, so the question is whether or not the team is winning or losing. The joke is clever because it puns on the phrase "four years ago," which is a common measurement of time in regards to politics.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the suit is asking the boys if they are doing better now than they were when the game started, but the phrase "better off" can also refer to wealth/possessions. In this case, it's funny because the boys are playing baseball, and so, they are unlikely to have accrued any wealth or possessions over the course of the game.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?" which is a common question asked during election seasons. The baseball context makes it funnier because it's unexpected, and because it's a very long time to wait for results (in general, most elections only last for a few months).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "are you better off now than you were four years ago," which is a common question asked in political debates.

In this case, the joke is referencing the fact that the game has been going on for a while, and the umpire is asking if the players are any better off than they were when the game started. This is a play on words because the umpire is literally asking if the players have gotten any hits in the game.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common political campaign question "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?" The question is typically asked during a time of economic recession or negative job growth, neither of which are relevant to a baseball game.

The politician is asking the children if they are doing better now than they were before, but in baseball, an inning is a unit of play, so the politician is really asking if they are doing better now than they were four play periods ago. This is a nonsensical question, which is what makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the suit is asking the boys if they are better off now than they were four innings ago, referring to the game of baseball they are playing.

In this context, the joke is making a comment on how the boys might not be doing very well in their baseball game, but they are probably still better off than they were four innings ago.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
