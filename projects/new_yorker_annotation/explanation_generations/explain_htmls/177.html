The train is saying that he and the other train broke up, or uncoupled. But, he is also saying that he got drunk, or hit the sauce, which likely led to the breakup.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the train which is sitting at the bar is not happy with its current situation, and has decided to "uncouple", or detach itself, from the rest of the train. This is a metaphor for the man leaving his family or responsibilities behind.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Uncoupled" can mean two things: 1) to physically detach two train cars and 2) to break up with someone romantically. In this context, the train is making a pun by saying that he and the other man have "uncoupled" in the sense that they are no longer together.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the train is sad because it has been uncoupled, or separated, from its cars. This is a play on words, because when a train is uncoupled, it is no longer functional, but when humans are uncoupled, it usually refers to a breakup from a romantic partner. The fact that the train is at a bar drinking by itself after being uncoupled furthers the joke by implying that the train is coping with its loneliness in the same way that humans might.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "uncouple": normally, when two people "uncouple", it means they break up. However, in this context, "uncouple" refers to the fact that the two train cars have been disconnected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Uncoupling" is both a technical term for what happens when a train disconnects from its cars, and also a term for what happens when a couple breaks up. The fact that the train is sad and crying implies that it has gone through a break-up, and the joke is that the train is taking its break-up very literally.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men are both trains, but they are different types of trains. The first man is a locomotive, which is a type of train that pulls cars, while the second man is a caboose, which is a type of train car that is typically at the end of a train. The joke is that the two men have "uncoupled," or broken up, which is a pun on the fact that locomotives and cabooses disconnect from each other.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the train man is saying that he and the other train disconnected, or "uncoupled", which is a polite way of saying that they broke up. The fact that he is using this terminology in a bar context is humorous because it's usually not how people talk about breakups, especially in a public setting like a bar.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The term "uncoupling" is typically used to describe when two railroad cars detach from each other while a train is moving. In this situation, the train is drinking at a bar, and the man next to him is his anthropomorphized train car that he has detached from. The joke is clever because it is both a visual pun (the actual train cars are sitting next to each other at the bar) and a verbal pun (the two are talking about detaching from each other).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The train is Sad because it uncoupled from its wife, but it's also drunk, so it's slurring its words. The joke is clever because it's both a simple pun and a play on the emotions of the train.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The train is sitting at the bar, and the man is sitting next to him, implying that they are friends or at least acquainted with each other. However, the train man says that they "uncoupled", which has a double meaning: first, that they are no longer physically connected as a train, and second, that they are no longer together as friends. The wordplay is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in this situation, the train is drunk and the man is trying to pick him up. The train man says he's uncoupled, meaning that he's no longer attached to the rest of the train, as a way of saying that he's single and available.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "uncouple" can mean to detach something, or in this case, to divorce. The train is saying that he and his wife have divorced, but because he is a train, he uses the word "uncouple" to mean detach.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is talking about how he and the train "uncoupled" --- in other words, they broke up, or stopped being together. However, in the context of trains, "uncoupling" refers to the separating of two train cars. Thus, the man is saying that he and the train stopped being together in a literal sense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because train couples are two trains that are connected together, and the term "uncouple" usually refers to two people who are breaking up or divorce. However, in this case, the train is saying that he and the other train uncoupled, or disconnected.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="176.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="178.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
