How can I help?</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The person who is stuck under the whale is asking for help, and the person who received the message is asking how they can help. The word "message" can be read as both a call for help, and a communication/text/note.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "I got your message" can mean that someone understands what someone else is trying to communicate. In this case, the person underneath the whale is trying to communicate that they need help, and the person who got the message is offering to help. However, the phrase can also mean that someone received a written message, such as a text or email. In this case, the person who got the message is asking how they can help, since they don't know what the message is about.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "I got your message," which usually means "I understand what you're trying to say." In this case, the phrase is literally true, as the person who the message was meant for is underneath the whale. The person who the message was meant for is also asking how they can help, which is ironic given that they are the ones who need help.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The person who is under the whale is presumably trying to send a message in a bottle, but instead they got a whale. The whale is so large that it covers the entire island, including the person who is trying to send the message. The person asking how they can help is presumably the person who received the message in a bottle.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it suggests that the whale was intentionally beached on the island in order to crush the man and the tree. It's as if the whale is a delivery person who has accidentally killed someone with a package he was delivering. The joke is also funny because whales are very large animals, and it's unusual to see them on land; they are typically only found in the ocean.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The person who is underneath the whale is essentially 'beached,' or stuck on the island. The person who gets the message is asked how they can help, and the joke is that the only way to help is to come to the island and remove the whale.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "message" can mean both a text or note sent from one person to another, or it can refer to the idea of agroup of sperm cells being sent to an egg during reproduction. In this case, the sperm cells are represented by the whale, and the egg is represented by the small island. The man who was crushed by the whale is thus asking how he can assist in reproduction.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the whale has literally crushed a man and a tree, yet the man is still alive and talking. This is impossible, of course, but the fact that the man is still conscious and talking despite being under a whale is humorous. The man is also surprised that the whale is talking to him, given the fact that whales don't typically talk to humans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "I got your message" is often used to mean "I understand what you're trying to say." In this case, the phrase is literal: the whale is on top of a man who is trying to send a message (presumably for help), and the whale is asking how he can help. However, because the whale is so large, he is crushing the man, making it impossible for him to actually help.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the stereotype of whales as being very large animals. The person who is stuck underneath the whale is clearly in distress, but the other person's reaction is nonchalant and unhelpful.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the whale has beached himself on the island in such a way that it appears he is trying to use a telephone. The man and the tree are beneath him, acting as the telephone's receiver and base, respectively. The joke reinforces the stereotype that whales are large and intelligent animals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "I got your message" can mean either that the person understands what the other person is trying to communicate, or that the person received a physical note or message. In this case, the person received the message by the whale crashing onto the island, crushing the man and tree beneath him. The whale essentially delivered the message "I'm stuck on this island, please help me."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the whale is beached on a small island, and he has crushed a man and a tree beneath him. This suggests that the whale is very large and didn't fit on the island. The fact that the whale has crushed a man beneath him implies that the man was trying to send a message by beaching himself on the island, but the whale didn't get the message. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: the man was trying to send a "message" by beaching himself, but the whale misinterpreted it as an actual message, and thus asked how he could help.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the whale is so large that he crash landed on the small island, and yet the man underneath him is still alive and talking. The joke is also clever because it uses the word "message" in two ways: first, that the whale's landing on the island was a message in itself, and second, that the man is literally under the whale and can't move, so he is sending a message (for help).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man under the whale is asking for help, but the whale is too large to provide any assistance. The joke is also a play on the fact that whales are often beached, or stranded, on small islands.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="176.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="178.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
