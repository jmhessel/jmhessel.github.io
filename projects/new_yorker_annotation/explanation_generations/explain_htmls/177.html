He is considering paying 4,000,000 shrimp to save her, which is a lot of shrimp. The joke is also funny because the giant squid is not a real animal, so the man would have to go to a lot of effort to find that many shrimp.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "where am I going to get the money for the ransom?". In this case, the woman who was kidnapped by the giant squid is being ransom for 4,000,000 shrimp, which is a lot of shrimp. The joke is clever because it's a play on words, and it's also funny because it's a very specific number of shrimp.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="176.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="178.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
