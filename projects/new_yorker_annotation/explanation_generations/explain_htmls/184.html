The deer are admiring a road sign that says "deer crossing" and the joke is that they are imagining the sign in a different location. The deer are crossing the road to get to the forest and the joke is that they would like the sign to be placed in the space between the edge of the forest and the highway.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are looking at traffic signs, which are meant to be placed along the highway to direct drivers. However, the deer comment on how the sign would look good in their natural habitat between the forest and the highway. This is funny because it's a non-sequitur --- the sign would serve no purpose in that location.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are admiring the road signs for their aesthetic value, i.e., they think the signs are artwork. But, of course, the signs are functional objects meant to direct traffic, not art. The deer's misunderstanding is humorous because it's a common mistake people make: confusing function with art.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the irony of the deer admiring the road signs. The deer are looking at the signs as if they are art, when in fact the signs are meant to warn drivers to be cautious of deer crossing the road. The deer are effectively admiring their own deaths.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that deer often get hit by cars when they try to cross highways. In this case, the deer are admiring a road sign that would warn drivers of their presence, and suggesting that it would be a good addition to the space between the forest and the highway. The joke is clever because it's a literal interpretation of the road sign: the deer are using the sign to cross the highway safely.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the high-brow setting of the art museum and the low-brow subject matter of the road signs. The deer are admiring the signs as if they are fine art, but the signs are just mundane objects that are meant to be functional, not aesthetic. The joke is also clever because it points out the potential placement of the signs (between the forest edge and the highway), which is clever given that the signs are typically placed in those locations.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The deer are looking at "deer signs" which are road signs that warn drivers to watch out for deer crossings. However, the deer in the joke are interpreting the signs as actual art, and are discussing how one particular sign would look good in their natural habitat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are talking about how the road signs would look good in their natural habitat, i.e., the forest. However, the fact that they are at a museum admiring the road signs suggests that they are not in their natural habitat. This is ironic because it is usually humans who are not in their natural habitat when they are in a museum.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are admiring a road sign, something that is typically found on the side of a highway. The deer are considering putting the sign in their forest, which would be a strange and out-of-place location for a road sign. The joke is clever because it plays on the double meaning of the word "sign," which can refer both to a physical object and to a meaning or message.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are looking at road signs, which are meant to be placed on the side of highways to guide drivers. The deer are considering where to put the signs, and the joke is that they would be more likely to put them in the forest, where other deer live, rather than on the side of the highway. This is because deer are often hit by cars on highways, so the signs would be more effective in the forest in warning other deer of the danger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are looking at a painting of a forest, and the speaker is suggesting that the painting would be a good addition to their real-life forest home. This is funny because it's a non sequitur: the painting is two-dimensional, so it couldn't possibly work as an addition to a real, three-dimensional forest.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because deer aren't able to understand human art. They're just looking at pictures of other deer, which they probably see every day in the wild. The fact that the deer are in a gallery, and that one of them is suggesting that the signs would make good home decor, is ironic and funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The deer are looking at traffic signs, which are meant to be placed along roadsides to direct drivers. However, the deer want to put the sign in the forest, which is the natural habitat for deer. The joke is that the deer are misunderstanding the purpose of the sign.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The deer are looking at "deer" signs, which are traffic signs that warn drivers to be aware of deer on the road. The joke is that the deer are considering putting one of the signs in their natural habitat to warn drivers to be aware of deer on the road.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the deer are looking at a deer crossing sign, and the deer are suggesting that the sign would be more effective if it were placed in a location where there were more deer, i.e., closer to the forest where they live. This is ironic because the deer crossing sign is meant to warn drivers of the presence of deer on or near the highway, not to actually keep deer off the highway.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="183.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="185.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
