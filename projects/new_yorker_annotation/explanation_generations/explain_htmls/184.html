However, the joke is poking fun at the fact that the man looks ridiculous in his outfit, regardless of his ancestry.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's incongruous to see a king walking down the street in modern times. It's even more incongruous to see someone wearing a full royal outfit, complete with a crown, as the man in the scene is doing. The speaker is saying that, regardless of what results from a DNA test might say about the man's ancestry, he looks ridiculous in his current outfit.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is wearing a crown and cape, which would traditionally signify that he is a king. However, the woman he is with is not impressed, and points out that he looks ridiculous. The joke is clever because it playfully subverts the expectations of a traditional king.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is wearing a crown, which is something that kings or queens would wear, yet he is not royalty. The joke is making fun of the fact that the man is pretending to be something he's not. Furthermore, the woman's comment ("you look ridiculous") suggests that she does not find him attractive, despite his attempt to appear regal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is dressed like a king, but he's just a normal person walking down the street. He looks ridiculous because he's not actually a king. The joke is also clever because it uses the word "ancestry" in a double meaning: the man looks like he's from royal lineage, but he's also dressed like he's from the past.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The first meaning is that the guy's outfit looks ridiculous, which it does. The second meaning is that the guy's outfit is ridiculous because he's not actually royalty, despite what his ancestry results might say. The joke is clever because it's both a criticism of the outfit and a jab at people who might put too much stock in their ancestry results.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's outfit is outlandish and over-the-top, and it's not clear what his motivation is for wearing it. He could be roleplaying, or he could simply think he looks regal and handsome. However, to the speaker, he just looks foolish. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the fact that many people research their ancestry and try to dress like their ancestors, even if they are from a different era.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in real life, if someone were to dress like a king in public, people would stare and/orlaugh at them. The joke is playing on the incongruity of someone wearing a royal outfit in a common setting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is dressed as a king, which is a ridiculous outfit to wear in public. The woman is telling him that he looks ridiculous, even though he may have thought he looked regal and royal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is dressed like a king, which is something that would normally only be done in private or for a special occasion. The fact that he's just walking down the street shows that he doesn't care what other people think, and this contrasts with the expected behavior of someone with royal blood.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's outfit is ostentatious and would probably only be worn by someone with a lot of money or power. However, regardless of his lineage, the joke is that he looks ridiculous in the outfit.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in real life, people who dress up like they're royalty often do so because they believe they have royal ancestry. However, the speaker in this joke is saying that regardless of what the other person's ancestry results said, they still look ridiculous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the crown and robes that the man is wearing would normally be associated with someone of a royal lineage. However, the speaker says that the results of his ancestry test said that he was not related to royalty, which invalidates his claim to the outfit. The man looks ridiculous because he is not actually a king, despite his clothing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is telling the other person that he looks ridiculous, even though he may think he looks regal in his king's outfit. The speaker doesn't care about the other person's ancestry results, which may have said that he was related to royalty, because he still looks foolish in the modern world.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Guy is wearing a crown, which is typically associated with royalty, and someone has commented on how ridiculous he looks. The joke is effective because it's surprising that a Guy would be wearing a crown, which implies he has a high social status, but he is being ridiculed for it. This is usually the inverse of what happens, where someone of a lower social status is ridiculed by someone of a higher social status.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="183.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="185.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
