He's completely ignoring his duty, and instead is chatting idly about the weather. This is unexpected and funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lifeguard is talking about a weather phenomenon, a warm front, which is entirely out of his purview as a lifeguard. A warm front coming through would melt the ice, making it more difficult to skate, but that isn't the lifeguard's concern. His only concern should be the safety of the people skating, but he's more interested in the weather.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="209.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="211.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
