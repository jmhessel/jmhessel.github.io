The couple's house is being destroyed, and the husband says that he is interested in getting home insurance. Getting insurance would not help in this instance because the damage has already been done. The joke is clever because it points out the absurdity of the couple's situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the midst of the chaotic scene of a wrecking ball coming through their living room, the husband is calmly asking his wife if she's interested in buying home owner's insurance. This is a non-sequitur because, in the moment, they should be more concerned with the damage that's being done to their house, rather than whether or not they have insurance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non-sequitur: the speaker is asked if they are interested in something, to which they respond with something else entirely. In this case, the speaker is asked if they are interested in the wrecking ball in their house, to which they respond that they are interested in home insurance. The joke is funny because it is unexpected and does not make sense in the context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the presence of the wrecking ball in the house is unexpected and destructive. The homeowner's insurance will protect the house from the damage, but the premium will likely go up, making the joke an ironic statement.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple's house is being destroyed and they are still sitting there calmly. In the situation, it would make sense to ask if they are interested in homeowners insurance because their house is being torn down. However, the fact that they are still calmly sitting in the living room makes the joke humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple's house is being demolished right in front of them (by a wrecking ball), yet the man casually asks if the woman is interested in home insurance. This is ironic because, usually, people only get insurance when their house is intact and they want to protect it from future damage. In this case, however, it's too late and the house is already being destroyed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the husband is calmly talking to the wife about home insurance while their house is being destroyed by a wrecking ball outside. This is silly because, in a normal situation, someone's house being destroyed would be a time of panic, not a time to start thinking about insurance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in the house is totally nonchalant about the wrecking ball going through their living room. Most people would be freaking out if a wrecking ball smashed through their house, but this person is calmly inquiring about home insurance, as if nothing is wrong. This reflects the reality that many people are more concerned with their possessions than their own safety.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who is presumably the homeowner is more interested in getting insurance money than in the fact that their house has just been destroyed by a wrecking ball. This is unexpected because, in most cases, people would be more concerned with their property damage than with getting money from their insurance company.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple's house is being destroyed and they are nonchalantly talking about home insurance. In a normal context, if someone's house was being destroyed, they would be panicking, not interested in calmly discussing their insurance options. The joke is satirizing the idea that insurance companies take advantage of people's misfortune.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the homeowner is being asked if they are interested in insurance for their home, but there is a wrecking ball inside their living room. The homeowner's nonchalant response implying that this is a normal occurrence points to the absurd situation: why would someone need insurance for their home if there is a wrecking ball inside it destroying it?</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is nonchalantly asking if the person driving the wrecking ball is interested in home insurance, as if the construction worker had asked him a question about it. This is funny because it's unexpected; usually, it's the home owner that has to worry about whether or not their home is insured, but in this case, the home is being destroyed and so the insurance would be for the person driving the wrecking ball.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple's house is being literally destroyed and the man is asking about home owner's insurance. The joke is clever because homeowners insurance would usually cover something like this (destruction of property), but it's still funny because the timing is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple's nonchalant reaction to the wrecking ball crashing through their wall is incongruous with the reality of the situation. In addition, the fact that the man asks if the insurance agent is interested in home insurance implies that this type of situation is not covered under normal home insurance, which further emphasizes the absurdity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person in the house is using the opportunity of a wrecking ball destroying his home to try to sell insurance. This is a play on the idea that insurance salesmen are always looking for an opportunity to make a sale, even if it's not in the best interest of the person they are selling to.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
