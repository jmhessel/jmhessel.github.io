The audience is expecting Moses to receive the ten commandments from God, but instead, God is giving Moses a sweater. The Ten Commandments are a set of moral and religious rulings that are binding, whereas a sweater is just a suggestion, i.e., it's not as important. This joke is clever because it's both a pun and a play on expectations.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that the Ten Commandments are traditionally seen as law imposed by God, which Moses received on Mount Sinai. In contrast, the sweater is seen as a more innocuous suggestion from God, which the man is free to follow or ignore.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the hand of God is giving Moses a jacket, which one might interpret as a commandment from God to put on the jacket. However, the fact that the commandment is not one of the Ten Commandments suggests that it's not as important as the others, i.e., it's just a suggestion.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The modern jacket is not a "commandment," as in something that Moses must follow, but rather, it's a "suggestion" from God, as in something that would be nice for him to have. The joke is clever because it's a reversal of the usual roles: Moses is typically the one giving commandments, not receiving them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The commandment "Thou shalt not kill" is often interpreted as meaning "Thou shalt not murder," i.e., to kill another person intentionally and unlawfully. However, the joke suggests that maybe God didn't mean for that to be a hard and fast rule, and that killing under certain circumstances (e.g., self-defense) may be acceptable.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The hand of God is giving Moses a jacket, but instead of it being a commandment from God, it's just a suggestion. The joke is also funny because it's a bit of a paradox --- why would God need to give Moses a jacket, since God is omnipotent and could just make the weather warmer?</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The physical item that God is handing to Moses is a sweater, but sweaters are often associated with the phrase "to keep warm", as in, "it's cold outside, you should put on a sweater to keep warm." In this case, God is not giving Moses a commandment, but rather a suggestion, to put on a sweater to keep warm. The joke is clever because it's a pun on the phrase "to keep warm" and the fact that sweaters are often worn to do just that.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The fact that God is reaching down from the clouds to give Moses a sweater is a visual pun on the fact that one of the ten commandments is "Thou shalt not kill." In other words, the sweater is not a commandment, just a suggestion.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the turtleneck sweater is not one of the ten commandments that Moses is supposed to be receiving from God, but rather, it's just a casual suggestion from God. The joke is clever because it's a clever way to get around the fact that there are only supposed to be ten commandments.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Not a commandment" refers to the fact that God is not giving Moses a new commandment, but rather a sweater. The joke is that sweaters are often seen as a polite suggestion, rather than a commandment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The first meaning is that God is suggesting, not commanding, that Moses put on the jacket; the second meaning is that the Ten Commandments are suggestions, not actual commands. The latter meaning is a bit of a stretch, but it's still funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is usually assumed that when God gives someone a task, it is a 10 Commandment-style order that must be followed. In this case, the man has been given a sweater, which presumably means that he should put it on, but it's phrased as a suggestion, not a commandment. This could be interpreted as God being more casual/friendly, or it could be interpreted as the man being free to ignore the suggestion.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the idiom "Just a suggestion" which is usually used to preface a non-mandatory suggestion. However, in this case, the huge hand coming out of the clouds is clearly meant to be God, making the joke a clever way of saying that the suggestion (in this case, to wear a sweater) is not actually from God, despite the clear implication.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. God is suggesting, not commanding, that Moses put on the jacket. This is funny because, in the Bible, God is usually portrayed as commanding Moses rather than making suggestions.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="209.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="211.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
