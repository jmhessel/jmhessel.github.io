The joke is clever because, of course, the dinosaur is already extinct. The cavemen are talking about the dinosaur in the present tense, but the dinosaur is only a memory at this point.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the value of the cave painting will go up when the reptile who created it becomes extinct. This is because the painting will be the only remaining record of that reptile's existence. The joke is also clever because it playfully comments on the rarity of cave paintings, which often depict extinct animals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is true: the prehistoric reptile's paintings will be worth more when he's extinct because there will be fewer of them. The joke is also funny because it playfully pokes at the idea that people only value art when it is rare or no longer made.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The first meaning is that the caveman's drawings will be worth more when the dinosaur is extinct, because they will be rare. The second meaning is that the caveman himself will be worth more when the dinosaur is extinct, because he will be the only one who can do cave drawings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully comments on the value of art. The cavemen are less concerned with the quality of the art and more concerned with the fact that the artist will eventually be extinct, which will add to the value of the painting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cavemen are implying that the paintings will be worth more once the reptile who made them is extinct. This is because the paintings would then be considered rare and valuable artifacts. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the phrase "it will be worth more when he's dead," which is a dark joke about how people are only valued for their usefulness after they die.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the reptile is cave painting and the cavemen are angry about it. The joke is clever because it is true: the reptile's paintings will be worth more money when he is extinct because there will be fewer of them. The joke is also clever because it plays on the fact that cave paintings are valuable prehistoric artifacts.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it sarcastically comments on the value of the dinosaur's art. In the present, the cave drawings may not be worth much, but in the future, when dinosaurs are no longer around, the drawings will be priceless because they will be the only record of what dinosaurs looked like. The joke is also funny because it playfully mocks the idea that cavemen were simple-minded by suggesting that the caveman is aware of the future value of his drawings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the archeologists who find the cave paintings are upset because the caveman has drawn over the prehistoric reptile's painting. The caveman is happy because he thinks his painting is better. The joke is clever because, although the caveman's painting will be worth more because he's extinct, the reptile's painting is actually worth more because it's a prehistoric artifact.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is sarcastically saying that the value of the painting will go up once the artist (the reptile) is extinct. This is funny because, of course, the value of the painting can't go up if the artist is extinct because there would be no one around to appreciate the value of the painting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dinosaur is clearly not extinct yet, as he is standing right there in front of the cavemen. However, the cavemen are already anticipating the day when the dinosaur will be gone and they can sell his paintings for a high price. This joke is a play on the often-high prices that are paid for art by long-dead artists.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The caveman says that the drawing will be worth more when the reptile is extinct, meaning when the reptile dies and is no longer around to create more art. However, "extinct" can also mean that the reptile is no longer around, i.e., that it's already dead, which is what the caveman is saying.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cavemen are predicting that the value of the dinosaur's art will go up after he dies. This is because, once the dinosaurs are extinct, there will be no more of their art. The art will become a valuable collectors item. The joke is also ironic because the cavemen are talking about the dinosaur becoming extinct, when in reality, it is the cavemen who will become extinct.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the value of the paintings will go up when the artist is no longer alive to produce more paintings, i.e., when he is extinct. But, in this case, the artist is a reptile, meaning that he is already extinct. So, the paintings are valuable not because the artist is dead, but because he was never alive to begin with.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is assuming that the dinosaur will eventually go extinct, and thus the cave paintings will be even more valuable. This is a play on the fact that ancient cave paintings are valuable artifacts that are studied by historians and archaeologists. The joke is clever because it also points out the irony that the caveman is worried about the future value of the paintings when he himself is a primitive caveman.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="194.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="196.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
