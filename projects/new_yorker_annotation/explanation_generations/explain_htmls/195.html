The phrase "I can still vote by mail" refers to the fact that the person can still vote even though they are stuck in the sand art. However, the word "mail" can also refer to the sand that the person is stuck in. So, the person is saying that they can still vote (by mail) even though they are stuck in the sand.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The two people are playing in a sandbox, which is a type of toy for children. However, the word "sandbox" can also refer to a test environment for software developers, where they can try out new code without breaking the main codebase. In this second sense, the joke makes more sense, as developers often work in remote sandboxes, i.e., they are not in the same physical location as the main codebase. Thus, the person in the sandbox can still vote by mail, even though they are not in the same location as the voting booth.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that in some elections, people who are unable to physically go to a polling place (because they are, e.g., in the hospital) can cast their ballot by mail. In this case, the kid is unable to physically go to the top of his sandcastle, so he tries to cast his vote by mail.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The two people are playing in a sandbox, and one of them says that they can still vote by mail. The word "sandbox" can refer to a testing ground for new software, and "voting by mail" is a new way of voting that is being tested in some elections. The fact that they are both new things being tested in a literal sandbox is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the phrase "I still have a voice," meaning that the person buried in the sandcastle can still be heard and has a say in things. However, because they are trapped in the sandcastle, their actual voice is buried and they can't be heard. Thus, they can only vote by mail, which is another way of having a say in things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the adult is still technically able to vote, even though they are stuck in the sandpit. This is a play on the fact that, in many countries, people who are incarcerated are not allowed to vote, even though they are still citizens. The joke is emphasizing how ridiculous it is that the person is stuck in the sandpit by making a comparison to something that is similarly ridiculous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the kid is too tall to vote in person, so he has to do it by mail. This is a reference to the fact that some people are too tall to vote in person, so they have to do it by mail.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur. The two people playing in the sandbox are too busy building their sandcastle to pay attention to the man who's just trying to tell them a joke. The joke doesn't make sense in the context of what they're doing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually when people are talk about being locked up or caged in, it's in a negative light. But in this case, the person in the sand tower is making the best of their situation by being able to still vote by mail.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who is stuck in the sand tower is trying to reason with the kid who made the tower, telling them that they can still vote by mail even if they are stuck in the tower. This is silly because it's not possible to vote by mail if you are stuck in a sand tower.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people playing in the sandbox have built a giant sand castle, which is a common activity in sand pits. However, one of the people makes a comment about being able to vote by mail, which is a reference to the movie "The Princess Bride". In that movie, the character Vizzini shouts "I can still vote by mail!" after one of his plans fails; the line is often quoted and referenced in popular culture.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "by mail" can mean either receiving something through the postal system, or voting absentee by mail-in ballot. In this situation, the sand-people have built a giant tower, and one of them is joking that they could still vote by mail (absentee) even though they are now towering above the sandbox.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the sandcastle voter is trying to make a point that even though her vote might not be counted in the traditional way, she can still have her voice heard by voting by mail. The sandcastle is a metaphor for her being disenfranchised or marginalized, and the fact that she is still trying to participate in the political process is ironic and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "I can still vote by proxy," which means that someone can vote on behalf of another person. In this case, the person is saying they will vote by mail, which is another way of voting, but it's a less common method. The joke is clever because it's a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in order to vote by mail, you need to be a registered voter. The top of the sand castle is inaccessible, so the child at the top of the sand castle is not a registered voter, and thus cannot vote by mail.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
