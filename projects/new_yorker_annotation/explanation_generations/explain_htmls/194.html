I can't even turn this thing on.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the "infinite monkey theorem", which states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type out a given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. In this instance, the bird has been given the task of typing out a solution to a math problem, but he can't even figure out how to turn on the laptop. The bird's incompetence highlights the unlikelihood of the monkey theorem.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the "infinite monkey theorem" which posits that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type out the complete works of William Shakespeare.

In this case, the duck is not even close to being able to do that (or even turn on the computer), highlighting the absurdity of the original theorem.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it play on the fact that ducks are not very smart. In this situation, the ducks are trying to do math, but they can't even figure out how to turn on the computer. This is a play on the idea that if you put a bunch of monkeys at typewriters, they will eventually write a Shakespearean play, but in this case, the ducks can't even do simple math.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the "infinite monkey theorem," which states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a keyboard for an infinite amount of time will eventually type out the entire works of William Shakespeare. In this situation, the birds are the monkeys, and they are sitting in front of laptops, Presumably, they are hitting keys at random, but not getting anywhere. The joke is that if the monkeys (birds) can't even turn on the laptops, they certainly won't be typing out anything coherent.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the "infinite monkey theorem", which posits that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter for an infinite amount of time would eventually produce the complete works of William Shakespeare. In this case, the joke is that, even if the ducks were monkeys, they still wouldn't be able to produce the correct answer because they can't even turn on the computers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the infinite monkey theorem, which posits that a monkey hitting keys at random on a keyboard for an infinite amount of time will eventually type out the complete works of Shakespeare. In this case, the ducks are the monkeys, and instead of typing out Shakespeare, they can't even figure out how to turn on the computer. This joke implies that ducks are not as smart as monkeys, even though the theorem suggests that they should be.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the ducks are actually trying to do the work that they are assigned, but they are poorly equipped to do so because they are ducks. In reality, of course, ducks are not capable of using computers, which is what makes the joke funny. The joke also playfully pokes at the stereotype of scientists being bad at math.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the infinite monkey theorem, which posits that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter will eventually produce a specific work, like the works of Shakespeare. In this case, the bird students are seated in front of laptop computers, which are more sophisticated than typewriters, yet the joke implies that they are still hitting keys at random and not making any progress.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the disparity between the expected level of intelligence for the species of the creatures pictured (i.e., ducks) versus the level of intelligence required to use a computer (i.e., human level). The joke is a play on the fact that ducks are not known to be particularly intelligent animals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the duck is trying to do some sort of math problem, but he can't even turn on the computer to begin with. This implies that the duck is not very smart, which is why the joke is funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the infinite monkey theorem, which posits that if you have an infinite number of monkeys typing on an infinite number of typewriters, they will eventually produce the entire works of Shakespeare. However, in this situation, there is only one monkey (a bird) and one laptop, and it's not clear how it would be able to produce anything, let alone the answer to a question on a test.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the scientist ducks are clearly not smart enough to figure out how to turn on the laptops in front of them, let alone answer the question on the screen. This is a play on the idea that if you put enough monkeys in front of enough typewriters, eventually one of them will write a Shakespearean sonnet. But in this case, the monkeys are ducks, and they can't even figure out how to turn on the typewriters.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a reference to the "infinite monkey theorem", which states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type out a given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare.

The joke is made funnier by the fact that the duck is in a lecture hall, implying that it is trying to learn, but its simple mindedness is preventing it from even getting started.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="193.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="195.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
