In this case, the husband is trimming the bushes in the shapes of body builders, which the wife finds strange. However, the husband was previously doing self-portraits, which the wife also found strange. So, the wife's statement is ironic because she's essentially saying that she prefers the husband's previous activity to his current one, even though she found both to be strange.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the wife is implying that the husband's sculptures are more narcissistic than the self-portraits he used to do. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words --- the wife is wishing her husband would go back to doing "self-portraits" (i.e., paintings or drawings of himself), but her husband is actually doing "self-portraits" in the form of sculptures of himself as muscular men.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the wife is worried about her husband's new hobby of trimming the bushes into body building shapes. She implies that his old hobby, self-portraits, was more normal and less worrying. The joke is funny because it's a play on words --- "self-portraits" can mean either paintings or photographs that someone takes of themselves, or they can mean masturbation. So the wife could either be asking her husband to go back to painting or photographing himself, or to stop trimming the bushes and go back to masturbating.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="221.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="223.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
