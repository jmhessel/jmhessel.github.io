The chef is chasing the other chef with a knife, which could be considered a form of rioting, and so the waiter is telling the other waiter to let the table know that their food will be delayed because of the commotion.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter is completely nonchalant about the chef with the knife chasing the other chef around the kitchen island, as if it's a completely normal thing that happens. He casually informs the other waiter that there will be a delay on the risotto, as if the delay is due to something mundane like the cook taking a smoke break.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter is telling the other waiter to inform the customers that their food will be delayed ... but the reason for the delay is because one of the chefs is being chased by another chef with a knife. So, the joke is funny because it's a matter-of-fact delivery of a very absurd situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter is completely nonchalant about the fact that there is a murder taking place in the kitchen. The different elements of the room (two chefs, one with a knife, a man playing music, a giant fish on the floor) make it clear that something strange is going on, but the waiter is completely unfazed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "this is going to get messy." In a restaurant kitchen, it is not uncommon for there to be a lot of chaos: waiters running around, chefs cooking, plates being dropped, etc. This joke suggests that the waiters are so used to the chaos that they don't even bat an eye when one of the chefs starts chasing the other with a knife.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a nonchalant response to a chef attempting to murder another chef. In a normal restaurant, the staff would be more concerned about the delay in the risotto than a murder that is happening. However, since the restaurant is set up like a circus, with a giant fish and a man playing music, it is clear that this is not a normal restaurant, and so the staff's reaction is fitting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the movie "Reservoir Dogs", in which a group of criminals plot and carry out a diamond heist. One of the criminals is caught and tortured by the police, leading to a big argument about whether or not to kill him. The joke here is that the same thing is happening in the restaurant kitchen, with the two chefs arguing about whether or not to kill the other chef, and the waiter trying to stay out of it and just do his job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "killing two birds with one stone." In the context of the scene, the chef is actually trying to kill another chef with a knife, so the waiter's statement is both accurate and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter is telling the other waiter to delay the risotto for table seven, while in the background a chef is chasing another chef with a kitchen knife. The joke is clever because it is a pun on the word "rice." Risotto is a dish made with rice, so by telling the other waiter to delay the dish, the speaker is also telling him to delay the rice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a nonchalant response to a chaotic scene. The waiter's job is to communicate delays in food to diners, so despite the fact that there is a chef chasing another chef with a knife, he is focused on his job and delivering the message about the delay in the risotto. The joke contrasts the mundane task of the waiter with the more exciting and dangerous task of the chef, making it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The waiter is saying that there will be a "slight delay" on the risotto, but the word "delay" can also be a synonym for "interruption." In this case, the interruption is the chef chasing the other chef with a knife.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a nonchalant way of telling the other waiter that there is a knife fight going on in the kitchen and that the diners at Table Seven will have to wait a little longer for their food. It is also humorous because playing the viola is usually not associated with being in the middle of a fight.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the trope of the "calm before the storm": the two waiters are having a casual conversation while the chaos goes on behind them. It's as if they are completely oblivious to the chef chasing another chef with a kitchen knife.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter playing it straight and telling the other waiter to pass on a message to the customers, even though the customers can probably hear the commotion going on in the kitchen. Additionally, it's unusual that a viola would be played in a kitchen, let alone during a heated argument between two people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it subverts the expectations of what would happen in a normal kitchen: usually, when two people are running around with a knife and someone else is playing the viola, the waitstaff would be more focused on clearing the area and getting the customers their food. In this instance, though, the waiter is more concerned with letting the customers know that their food will be delayed, as if this were a usual occurrence in the kitchen.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="221.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="223.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
