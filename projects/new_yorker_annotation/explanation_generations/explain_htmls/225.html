The boss is singing about how the company lost an account, and the rest of the board is probably not happy about it. The joke is also a pun on the phrase "all because," which can mean either "the whole reason" or "completely because." In this context, the boss is saying that the company lost the account because he didn't get his way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is singing a parody of the song "All Because of the Want That Got Away" by Jerry Lewis. The boss is referencing how a business deal or account that got away (the "want" in the song title) led to the company's current problems. This is a play on words because "want" can also mean "desire", as in, the company desired or wanted the account/business deal, but didn't get it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is singing about how the companyLost an important account, and he's doing it in a humorous way by making it into a song. The piano is also a symbol of wealth and success, so it's funny that the boss is using it as a prop in his performance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes fun of how a boss might act if they were to blame someone for losing an important account. The boss in the situation is acting like a villain in a movie who is monologuing their master plan before they kill the protagonist. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words; the boss is "singing" about the account that got "away."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is singing a very popular song, "All Because of the Account." The account getting away could be interpreted as meaning that the company lost an important account, which would be a big deal in a board meeting, or it could simply be a play on the lyrics of the song. In either case, the joke is clever and funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is singing about how the company is losing money because of an account that got away. The word "account" can refer to both a financial account and a story or record. In this case, the boss is singing about how the company lost money on a financial deal, but the joke could also be interpreted to mean that the company is losing money because someone is stealing from them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The boss is singing about an "account" that got "away" --- in other words, a client that left for a competitor. However, the word "account" can also mean a bank account, which makes the joke even funnier. The joke is also a parody of the song "The Way We Were" by Barbra Streisand.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is clearly frustrated that he lost an important account, and is taking it out by performing a sad song about it on the piano. The fact that he's doing this in front of the board of directors makes it even funnier, because he's making a spectacle of himself and venting his frustration in a very public way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is singing a blues-style song about how he lost an account (i.e., a customer), and the Blues is a music genre known for being sad and/or down-trodden. The piano is significant because the Blues is often associated with piano music. The joke is also funny because it's unexpected that the boss would be singing about losing an account in a board meeting; usually, in a business setting, it would be more professional to simply state that an account was lost, rather than to sing about it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is seemingly losing his mind, and singing about how everything is going wrong because one account got away. This is likely a reference to the "One ring to rule them all" from Lord of the Rings, where the ring gets away and causes havoc. The boss's descent into madness is playing off the idea that things going wrong at work can feel like the end of the world.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is singing a song about how he lost the account and is now being sued, instead of actually discussing business with the board. It's as if he's forgotten that he's in a meeting and is just performing a song. The joke is also a play on words, because "account" can mean both a financial account and a story or explanation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the whole board meeting is a performance by the boss, who is playing the piano and singing. This is a reference to the popular song "The Way We Were" by Barbra Streisand, which contains the lyrics "and all because two people fell in love," suggesting that the events of the board meeting (and, by extension, the company) are all because two people fell in love.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is singing about how the company lost an account, which is a bad thing. The fact that he is singing about it, instead of being angry or disappointed, makes it seem like he doesn't take the loss of the account seriously. The CEO playing the piano and singing is also unexpected and out-of-place in a board meeting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is singing about an "account that got away." This could mean either a business deal that fell through or a bank account that was lost or stolen. In either case, the boss is indirectly responsible and is belting out a song about it. The fact that the boss is singing dramatically about a business failure is absurd and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the song "The River Styx" by the band Awolnation. In the song, the singer croons about getting away from troubles by "selling his soul" and going down to the River Styx, which is the river that separates the living from the dead in Greek mythology. In this joke, the boss "sells his soul" by skipping the board meeting to play the piano and sing; the joke is a play on words because the "account" that got away is both a reference to the business meeting that didn't happen, and also a play on the phrase "can't keep down a good man" meaning that the boss escapes his mundane life by going down to the makeshift River Styx (the piano) and singing.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="224.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="226.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
