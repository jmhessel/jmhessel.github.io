This is impossible because rockets don't have doors or any way for someone to step out. The cop's request is absurd because it's impossible to do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police officer is asking the pilot to step out of his jet, which is impossible. This is a play on the typical traffic stop request for the driver to step out of the vehicle. The joke is made funnier by the fact that the pilot is in a giant jet, which makes the request even more absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop says the same thing to the rocket driver that he would say to a human driver who was stopped for a traffic violation. But in this case, it's comical because the rocket is so tall that the driver would have to really step out of the vehicle to comply - and even then, it's not clear how the cop would be able to write a ticket for a rocket.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police officer is asking the pilot to do something that is impossible given the size of the jet. The joke is a play on the common instruction given by police officers to drivers during a traffic stop.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is telling the rocket driver to step out of the vehicle, when in reality, it would be very difficult for the driver to do so given that they are a rocket. The cop is treating the rocket like a normal car, when in reality, it is anything but.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police officer is either asking the pilot to exit the jet so he can give him a ticket, or he's asking the pilot to get out of the jet so he can arrest him. The pilot is probably confused because he doesn't understand why he's being asked to get out of his jet.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police officer is acting like he's pulling over a car even though it's a giant jet. He's telling the pilot to step out of the vehicle, even though it would be impossible for the pilot to do so.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is telling the rocket driver that he needs to step out of the vehicle, even though he's a rocket and not a human. It's absurd because, obviously, a rocket can't step out of itself, and it's also making a pun on the phrase "to take a step out of the vehicle," which is a way of saying to exit the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police officer is telling the pilot of the jet to step out of the vehicle, even though it's a giant jet. This joke is a play on the trope of police officers telling people to "step out of the vehicle" when they are being pulled over. However, in this case, the officer is telling the pilot to step out of the giant jet, which is not a vehicle.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police officer is asking the pilot of the jet to step out of the vehicle, which is impossible because the pilot is in a giant jet. Additionally, the joke plays on the trope that police officers are often stereotyped as being rude or insensitive when dealing with the public.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the cop's usual request of drivers during a traffic stop ("step out of the vehicle") and the fact that the driver is in a rocket. In this case, the cop's request is impossible to comply with, since the driver is in a space vehicle.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is treating the rocket like it's a car that he has pulled over for a traffic violation. He's telling the driver of the rocket to step out of the vehicle, as if it's a car, when in fact, it's a rocket, and the driver is not a person, but rather, the rocket itself.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is asking the rocket driver to step out of the rocket, as if it were a car. But of course, the rocket is not a car, it's a rocket, and so the cop is asking the driver to do something impossible. The irony is that if the driver were to step out of the rocket, they would probably be killed, so it's not really a small step.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in order for the cop to write the ticket, he needs the rocket driver to step out of his vehicle. However, "small steps" are not possible for a rocket, which can only travel in a straight line and at a high speed. This joke pokes fun at the incongruity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop's request to the rocket driver is impossible. In order to comply, the rocket driver would have to take a step out of the rocket, but since the rocket is too big for him to do that, the cop's request is impossible.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="224.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="226.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
