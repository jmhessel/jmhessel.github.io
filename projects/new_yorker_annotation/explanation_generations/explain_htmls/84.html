This is funny because it's a non-sequitur, and also because it's a reminder that, even though pregnancy is a serious matter, it can be caused by something as mundane as a broken rubber seal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is telling the man (whose head has been replaced with a blender) that she is pregnant, and the man can't hear her because he is a blender. The joke is also a play on the fact that blenders often have a rubber seal that can break, and when that happens, it is very easy for things to get stuck in the blades, which can lead to pregnancy.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="83.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="85.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
