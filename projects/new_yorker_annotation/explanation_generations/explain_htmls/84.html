The menu says that service is not included, so the couple is essentially paying for the food and then cooking it themselves. This is a play on the fact that many restaurants have a service charge included in the bill, which is meant to cover the cost of things like waitstaff, cooking, and cleaning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is true: when you cook your own food at a restaurant, you are technically not receiving service, so you would not expect to have to tip. In other words, the restaurant is not making money off of you in the same way as they would if they were cooking and serving the food themselves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the fact that, in most restaurants, service is indeed included --- you don't have to cook your own food. However, in this restaurant, because you have to cook your own food, service is not included in the price of the meal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Service" can mean the act of waiting on or serving food to customers, but it can also refer to a tip. In this case, the customer is being told that they will have to cook their own food, and thus they will not be receiving any "service" in the traditional sense. However, since they will not be receiving any traditional service, they also will not be expected to leave a tip.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of the word "service." In a normal scenario, service would mean that the waiters/waitresses would bring the food to the table. However, in this context, "service" refers to the fact that the couple is cooking their own food. Thus, the man joking that service is not included is saying that the restaurant is not providing them with food, which is not what people typically expect from a restaurant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "service" can mean two different things: 1) the act of serving food, and 2) a tip that is given to waitstaff. In this case, since the customers are cooking their own food, they don't need the first definition of service, and so they only need to worry about the second definition. However, since they are at a restaurant, they probably don't have any cash on hand to give a tip, which is usually given in cash.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple in the foreground is cooking their own food, which they presumably ordered from the menu, and the menu says that service is not included. This is a play on words, as the couple is literally not getting any service from the restaurant staff. They are literally having to serve themselves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a typical restaurant, service is included in the bill (often as a gratuity/tip for the waitstaff). However, in this situation, since customers are cooking their own food, there is no service to be included. The joke is poking fun at the absurdity of the situation, where people are paying for a meal but have to do all the work themselves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is reversed: in a restaurant, it is usual for the chef to prepare the food and the servers to bring it to the customers. However, in this restaurant, the customers have to cook their own food, so the server is not needed. The joke is clever because it uses the normal meaning of "service" (the work done by a server in a restaurant) to mean "a included feature or benefit" --- in this case, the service of having someone else cook your food.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "service" can mean both the act of waiting on or serving someone, as one would expect in a restaurant setting, or it can refer to a tip that is usually given to service industry workers. In this case, the couple is literally being served by the other couple cooking their food, so they don't need to tip them. However, the couple in the background is surprised to find out that they don't need to tip, since they were expecting the normal level of service.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. In a restaurant, service is the food that is brought to you. However, in this situation, the "service" is the stove that you cook your own food on. So, the joke is saying that since you have to cook your own food, the "service" (of someone cooking your food for you) is not included.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people at the table are looking at the menu to see what they want to order, but the menu is for a home stove, not a restaurant. This means that they would have to cook their own food, and the joke is that they would then have to pay for the service of having someone else cook their food for them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two couples are sitting at stoves in a restaurant, which implies that they are supposed to be cooking their own food. However, the man in the background is reading the menu and says that service is not included, which means that the restaurant staff would not be cooking their food for them. This is a play on the fact that, in a normal restaurant, the service is included in the cost of the meal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that the couple in the foreground is cooking their own food. The joke implies that the couple is too cheap to pay for the restaurant's food, and instead are cooking their own food to save money.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The menu says that "service is not included," meaning that tipping the waiter is not expected, but the customers at the table are interpreting this as meaning that they will have to serve themselves. This is absurd because in a restaurant, the waitstaff is typically responsible for serving the food to the customers.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
