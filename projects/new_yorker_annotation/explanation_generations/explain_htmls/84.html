The cop asking the shark if it remembers what it had for lunch last Thursday is absurd because it's such a specific and granular question, and one that a human would have difficulty remembering if they were asked the same thing. The joke pokes fun at the idea that interrogations are meant to be challenging and frustrating for the person being interrogated.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is asking the shark a question that is clearly not relevant to the investigation at hand. The shark, being a creature of the sea, would have no memory of what it had for lunch last Thursday because it doesn't keep track of time in the same way humans do. This line of questioning is humorous because it's a non-sequitur.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common detective interrogating tactic of asking a lot of questions in rapid succession in order to trip up the suspect. In this case, the detective is asking a shark questions about a crime he obviously didn't commit (since he would have died). The joke is also funny because it's a play on the stereotype that sharks have poor long-term memory.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the detectives are trying toInterrogate the shark about a murder, but the shark can't answer their questions because he doesn't speak English. The detectives are getting frustrated, and one of them brings up how the shark probably can't even remember what he had for lunch last Thursday due to the short-term memory loss that is common in shark species.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the "good cop/bad cop" trope in interrogation scenes. The "good cop" is trying to be friendly with the shark by asking it a seemingly innocuous question about its lunch, while the "bad cop" is trying to intimidate the shark with his angry demeanor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because police officers often ask suspects in interrogations if they remember what they were doing at the time of the crime. In this case, the officers are investigating the shark for a crime, but because sharks don't have memories, the officers are wasting their time trying to get the shark to remember something it can't.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contradiction between the setting (an interrogation room) and the subject (a shark). Interrogation rooms are for questioning humans, who can answer questions and provide information. However, sharks are non-verbal animals who cannot answer questions. The joke is also funny because of the shark's reaction to the question --- he looks bemused, as if he's thinking, "How am I supposed to remember what I had for lunch last Thursday when I can't even speak?"</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cop is asking the shark a question that is impossible for him to answer. The cop knows that the shark can't answer the question, but he's trying to trip him up with an impossible question. The question is also relevant to the situation, because it's possible that the shark ate the person in the photo.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in order to interrogate someone, the police need to have a reason to believe that the person they are questioning has information that they need. In this case, the police are questioning the shark because they think the shark might have information about a crime that was committed last Thursday. However, the fact that the shark is a fish and would have no memory of what he had for lunch last Thursday makes the interrogation pointless.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police are trying to question the shark as if he is a human witness to a crime. The shark, of course, cannot answer because he cannot speak English. Furthermore, the police are questioning the shark about something he would have no way of knowing, since he was probably not there when the crime happened. The joke is clever because it's a play on the common interrogation tactic of trying to trip up the witness by asking them about details they wouldn't know unless they were actually there.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cops are questioning the shark about a crime that it may have committed, yet they are using tactics that would not work on a human being, such as asking it to remember what it ate for lunch last Thursday. This line of questioning is ineffective because, as a shark, the interrogated party doesn't have the same cognitive abilities as a human being would, so asking it to remember something from last week is pointless.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the police are interrogating a shark, and sharks have famously bad short-term memory. The joke is also funny because the police are trying to trick the shark into confessing to a crime by asking him a question about something he won't be able to remember.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's common for police interrogations to involve asking people to remember small details from their day-to-day lives in order to prove that they are telling the truth. However, this particular shark being interrogated is unlikely to remember what he had for lunch last Thursday because he doesn't have a concept of time and he doesn't have a memory like humans do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cops are trying to intimidate the shark with their questioning, but the shark is uncooperative and doesn't seem to be fazed by their tactics. This is likely because sharks have a very poor memory and would not be able to remember what they had for lunch last Thursday even if they wanted to.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the interrogation tactics used by the police are fruitless, as the shark being interrogated will not be able to answer any questions about what happened last Thursday because he would have been dead if he had been out of water for that long.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="83.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="85.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
