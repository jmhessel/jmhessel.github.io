I've been elected queen.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is staring at the man's head in the beehive because she's wondering why he's there, and the man's head is in the beehive because he's been elected queen of the bees. The man is using a pun to explain his presence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's head in the beehive is acting like a queen bee. The queen bee is the reproductive female in the beehive; she's the one who mates with the drones and produces offspring. The man's head in the beehive is saying that he can't leave because he's been elected queen, which is a position of high importance in the bee community.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman says she can't go because she's been elected queen, but the man inside the beehive says he can't come out because he's been elected queen. This reversal is humorous because it's unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is staring at the man with his head in the beehive because she's shocked, and the man says he can't leave because he's been elected queen. In other words, he's been chosen to be the leader of the bees, a role that is usually filled by a female.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's head being in the beehive implies that he is the queen bee. The queen bee is an important role in the beehive, and she is usually not seen by humans because she stays hidden in the hive. The woman probably thought she was seeing a man's head in the beehive, but it turns out to be the queen bee.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is saying that she can't go hide because she's been elected queen, but the woman is also a queen bee. So, the joke is that she's saying she can't go hide because she's a bee.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's face in the beehive is a reference to the queen bee; the queen bee is the only female bee in a hive that can reproduce, and thus she is "elected" to be the queen. In this case, the queen bee is saying that she can't come out because she has responsibilities to take care of the hive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is talking to the man who is hidden in the beehive, and she says that she can't go (leave the beehive) because she's been elected queen. This is a pun because the man is literally a "queen bee."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is staring at the man in the beehive because she's been elected queen, and in the beehive, the man is staring at her because he's been elected queen. The viewer is left to wonder who elected who.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's head is in a beehive, which implies that he is a bee. And, as the queen bee, he can't leave the hive. The woman is probably his wife or girlfriend, who is wondering why he can't come with her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the man's head is actually a bee, and that he has been elected queen of the hive. This is a play on the traditional role of women as homemakers and beekeepers.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "I can't because I'm the queen." The woman in the scene is clearly not a queen, yet she is saying that she can't leave because she's been elected queen. The joke is also a play on the fact that it is not possible for a man to fit inside a beehive, yet there is a man's face peering out from the beehive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's face peeking out of the beehive implies that he is the queen bee. This is a play on words because the man is literally the queen bee, but he is also saying that he can't leave because he has been elected (queen) to stay.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is impossible for a man to be elected queen of the bees. This is a reference to the fact that, in a beehive, there is only one queen bee; all of the other bees are male.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is impossible for a man to be elected queen of the bees. The man's head in the beehive is thus a comical sight, and his remark that he can't leave because he's been elected queen is even more absurd.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="13.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="15.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
