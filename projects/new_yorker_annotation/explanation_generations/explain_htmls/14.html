However, upon further reflection, it's funny because the deer are crossing the road in the signs, and so the deer in the museum are admiring signs of deer crossing the road.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The deer are admiring road signs, and the joke is that the road signs are of deer crossings. So, the deer are essentially admiring themselves. The joke is clever because it's a pun that requires you to think about the meaning of the words to get the joke.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="13.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="15.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
