This amplifies the strangeness of the situation by pointing out that there is something even stranger happening that wasn't immediately apparent.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the gym-goer is doing something that is already strange (rock climbing indoors), and the hand hold she's staring at is even more strange (it has a face). The joke is further funny because the gym-goer makes a comparison to another, more normal activity (playing racket ball) to emphasize how strange the situation is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The person climbing the wall is annoyed because the rock they are trying to grab onto has been replaced with a human face, making it difficult to climb. The joke is that there is a racket ball court on the other side of the wall, which is also a difficult place to climb.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The person climbing the wall is trying to avoid looking at the human face, but they are also trying to avoid the noise coming from the racket ball court on the other side of the wall. The joke is that the person is trying to avoid two things that are unpleasant, but they can't avoid both.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, not only is the hand hold a creepy face, but the fact that there is a racket ball court on the other side of it means that the woman would have to constantly see the face while she was trying to play. This would be extremely distracting and would make it hard to concentrate on the game.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman who is rock climbing is seeing a face on the wall that is probably a statue. The fact that there is a racket ball court on the other side of the wall suggests that the face is actually a two-dimensional painting, making it even more absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman sees a "face" on the wall, but it's actually aface, as in, a head or statue. The joke is that the person who put the statue there was trying to be funny, but instead it's just creepy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "racket" can mean a loud noise, or a tennis racket. In this context, the person is saying that the fact that there is a racket ball court on the other side of the wall is making the situation worse, because the noise from the court is making it difficult to concentrate on the climb. However, the other meaning of "racket" implies that the person is more worried about the people on the other side of the wall seeing them struggle to climb the wall with a human face on it. Either way, the joke is funny because it is a play on the multiple meanings of the word "racket."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is rock climbing, and she is staring at a hand hold that has the face of a man. The word "racket" can be used as a synonym for "noise," so the joke is that the racket from the other court is making it difficult for her to concentrate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is staring at a hand hold that has the face of a man, which is strange. However, the fact that there is a racket ball court on the other side of the wall implies that the hand hold is actually astatue of a man. The joke is clever because it uses the homonym "hold/holds" to make the pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a commentary on how seeing a human face on a rock climbing wall would be disconcerting, and the fact that there is a racket ball court on the other side makes it even worse, because it means that the person who put the face there could be watching the climbers and laughing at their reactions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the woman is staring at one of the handholds on the wall, which has the face of a man, and the joke is that the other side of the wall has a racket ball court. The joke is clever because it takes a common thing (a hand hold on a wall in a rock climbing gym) and makes it unusual (the hand hold has a human face), and then uses that to set up the play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that, in many gyms, the rock climbing wall is often next to the racket ball court. In this case, the person looking at the climbing wall can see the people playing racket ball on the other side, and the fact that there is a human face on the wall makes it even more surreal and funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the face on the wall is potentially creepy and unexpected, but the woman's reaction is much more understated than one would expect. She simply notes that there is a racket ball court on the other side, as if the face is not a big deal. This lack of reaction makes the joke funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is doing indoor rock climbing, which is usually done for fun or as a workout, but the addition of the man's face on the hand hold makes it seem like he is staring at her while she climbs, which would be creepy. The situation is made worse by the fact that there is a racket ball court on the other side, which suggests that there are other people who can see her, making the situation even more awkward and uncomfortable.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
