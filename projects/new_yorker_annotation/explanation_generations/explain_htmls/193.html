It's sillier because it's not clear how seeing a falling cement block would indicate that the speaker is lying, unless they had just said something like " there's nothingfalling from the ceiling" moments before.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to a common idiom, "God strike me dead!" which people say to emphasize the truthfulness of their statements. In this case, the man is so confident that he is telling the truth, that he is willing to put his life on the line and invoke God's wrath if he is wrong. The joke is clever because, of course, if he is wrong, then the very thing he is invoking, God striking him dead, will happen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "If I'm lying, then I'm dying." The man is about to be killed by a cinderblock, so the fact that he would say this phrase indicates that he thinks he is telling the truth and is about to die. However, the fact that he is about to be killed by a cinderblock is also funny in itself, because it is an unexpected and ironic death.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man about to be hit by the cinderblock says something that is often said for comedic effect, but in this case it is actually true. If he is lying, then perhaps God (or some other deity) could intervene and stop the cinderblock from hitting him. However, if he is telling the truth, then there is nothing that can be done to stop the cinderblock from hitting him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man about to be hit by the cinderblock is making a joke about how his companion wouldn't believe him if he said that a cinderblock was about to hit him. The man's companion, of course, then becomes the victim of the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is making a hyperbolic statement about how honest he is being. The stakes of his honesty are raised to the level of life-and-death, which is funny because it's an exaggeration. Furthermore, the joke is funny because it's possible that the man could be struck dead by the cinderblock, which would mean that his statement was actually true.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's declaration is a very serious one, and if he is lying, then he would be expecting to be immediately killed by a wrathful God. However, the situation he is in is not one where it would make sense for him to lie; if anything, he should be telling the truth to try to save his life. The joke is thus a play on the man's seriousness.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a verycommon expression, but in this case, it would be more accurate to say "if I am lying then let the cement block strike me dead." The joke is funny because it's a play on words, and the man's obliviousness to the impending danger makes it even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is saying that if he's lying then he wants to be killed by the cement block, which may or may not be divine intervention.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is so confident that what he is saying is true, that he is willing to stake his life on it. Of course, the fact that there is a giant cement block about to fall on him and kill him proves that he is, in fact, not telling the truth.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man says "If I am lying," which could mean either if he's telling a lie or if he's not telling the truth. In either case, the expected outcome would be that the cement block would hit him and kill him. However, because he's specifically asking for God to strike him dead, it's clear that he's telling the truth and the cement block won't hit him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it takes the form of a hyperbole, or an exaggeration for comedic effect. In this case, the joke is that the man is so confident that what he is saying is true, that he is willing to risk death by divine intervention if he is wrong. However, the ironic twist is that, as he is speaking, a chunk of concrete from the ceiling is falling towards him, which could very well kill him. Thus, the joke is funny because it is a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the nonchalant way that one man says a very serious thing (if I am lying then let God strike me dead) in response to the other man's innocuous question about whether or not the coffee is any good. The joke tries to get the listener to laugh at the absurdity of the situation by imagining the man's reaction if a big chunk of cement actually fell on him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker seems to think that the phrase "let God strike me dead" is a literal thing that will happen if he is telling a lie, when in reality, it is just an expression. The joke is made funnier by the fact that there is an imminent danger of a large cement block falling on and killing both men, so the speaker's use of the phrase takes on a new and humorous meaning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man says "if I am lying" as if he expects the cinderblock to fall on his head and kill him, which would be punishment for lying. The man's expectant death makes the joke darkly humorous.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="192.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="194.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
