In contrast, an alligator is a large and potentially dangerous animal, which would obviously be a nuisance in an office environment. The joke is clever because it playfully subverts the expectations around what kind of "toy" would be appropriate for a desk in an office.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The person who walks into the office is surprised to see a dead alligator on the desk, and comments that these "executive desk toys" are becoming a nuisance. In this case, "desk toys" are literal toys that executives play with on their desks, but the joke is that the alligator is not a toy but an actual animal, which is out of place in an office setting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because having a large alligator on your desk would definitely be a nuisance, and it would be especially surprising in an office environment. The fact that the man is so nonchalant about it just makes it funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is talking about how the executive desk toys, which are usually things like paperweights ornaments, are becoming a nuisance. But in this case, the desk toy is a dead alligator, which is much more nuisance than a paperweight.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is talking about how the alligator on the desk is becoming a nuisance. The alligator is a desk toy that is popular in executive offices. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the alligator is both a desk toy and a real alligator, which is causing a nuisance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is talking about how the dead alligator on the desk is becoming a nuisance. The joke is clever because "executive desk toys" is a common phrase for things that are used to decorate desks in offices, but usually don't serve any functional purpose. In this case, the "desk toy" is actually a dead animal, which is not only useless but also smelly and dangerous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The alligator is both an actual desk toy that some people have on their desks, and also a real alligator, which is definitely not a toy. The joke is making fun of the idea of having an alligator as a desk toy in the first place, but it's also poking fun at the man's reaction to seeing an alligator in his office, as if it's not a big deal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the executive desk toys the woman is referring to are usually things like stress balls or paperweights. In contrast, the desk toy in this office is a dead alligator, which is decidedly not stress-relieving. This joke is also funny because it paints a picture of a corporate office environment which is usually staid and boring, but in this case, is filled with the excitement (and potentially danger) of a wild animal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is talking about how the alligator on the desk is a nuisance, even though it's dead. This implies that the woman is used to seeing alligators in the office, and they are common enough that they are considered desk toys.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is talking about how the alligator on the desk is a nuisance, but the word "nuisance" can also refer to a bothersome or problematic person. In other words, the woman is saying that the alligator is a nuisance because it's a dead weight that's taking up space on the desk, but she could also be saying that the alligator is a nuisance because it's a reminder of the dangerous and unpredictable nature of the business world.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the executive desk toy is usually a small, inoffensive item, like a paperweight or a miniature replica of a building. In this case, the desk toy is an alligator, which is decidedly not inoffensive. The joke is clever because it playfully pokes at how some executives have expensive and unnecessary things, like an alligator desk toy, that take up space and serve no real purpose.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person is surprised to see an alligator on their desk, implying that it's not a common sight. The person is confused as to why there would be an alligator there, and equates it to an "executive desk toy", something that might be brought in by a boss or co-worker as a gift or prank. The joke is a play on the word "nuisance", both in the sense of something being a bother, and in the sense of an alligator being a dangerous animal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "executive desk toys" are a reference to the alligator on the desk, which is an unusual item to have in an office. The joke is clever because it's both a literal and figurative desk toy: an alligator is a toy that a child might play with, but it's also a "toy" in the sense that it's a decorative item on an executive's desk.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's deadpan delivery makes it seem like having a dead alligator on your desk is a regular thing that happens in this office, and it's become a nuisance. The joke is even funnier because, of course, it's not a regular thing, and the woman's delivery makes it seem like it's a completely normal office hazard.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a dead alligator, which is not a typical desk toy. The executive is probably referring to the alligator as a desk toy in a negative way, because it's a nuisance, but the joke is also funny because it's a unexpected object in an otherwise normal scene.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
