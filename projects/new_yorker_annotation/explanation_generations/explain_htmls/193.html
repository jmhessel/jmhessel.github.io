The man in the situation is shoveling snow, which is a type of work that is often done in the winter. However, the joke is that he is also "blowing snow," which is a type of activity that people often do for fun in the winter. The joke is clever because it takes a common saying and applies it to a situation that is the complete opposite.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is doing a difficult and physically strenuous task by hand that could easily be automated with a snowblower. The wife playing the guitar is likely a reference to the popular idiom "nagging wife," which implies that the wife is constantly complaining. In this case, she's not complaining, but the contrast between the difficult task the man is doing and the leisurely activity the woman is doing is funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common idiom "that's the way the cookie crumbles." In this case, the man is shoveling snow instead of cookies, and the idiom is used to mean that he's stuck in a difficult situation that he can't do anything about. The joke is clever because it's a double meaning --- not only is the idiom used, but the man literally isn't buying a snowblower, which would make shoveling snow much easier.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="192.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="194.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
