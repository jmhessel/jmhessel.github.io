No, I ordered roast beef.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's response to the falling cement block is unexpected. A normal reaction to a falling object would be to duck, but instead, the man casually comments on his order, as if the falling block is not a big deal. This situation is made even funnier by the fact that the man's order is roast beef, which is also a type of food, so his comment could be interpreted as him saying that the falling block is not a big deal because it is just food.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the double meaning of the word "duck": duck can mean to lower one's head quickly to avoid something, or it can mean a type of meat. In this case, the man is getting hit on the head with a cement block, so he lowers his head quickly to avoid it, but then realizes that he ordered roast beef, not duck.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, when one is told to duck in order to avoid something falling on their head, they would typically duck down below the level of the table. In this case, however, the man misunderstands and instead tries to catch the roast beef that was surely ordered but is now falling from the ceiling.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man about to be hit by the falling cinder block is misinterpreting his companion's warning. "Duck" is a common idiom meaning to move out of the way quickly to avoid being hit by something, in this case the cinder block. However, the man thinks his friend is telling him to Duck brand Roast Beef, which is a type of food. This misunderstanding is funny because it's a common occurrence that can happen in many different situations, not just when there's a cinder block about to fall on someone's head.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man looking up at the ceiling sees the cinder block and thinks his companion is telling him to duck, but in reality, his companion is telling him that the cinder block is about to fall on him and he should move. The joke is a play on words, with the word "duck" meaning both a type of bird, and a verb meaning to lower one's head quickly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man misinterprets the other man's warning of the impending danger. In this case, the danger is a cement block falling from the ceiling, but the man thinks the warning is about the breakfast item he ordered, i.e., duck. The joke is a play on the fact that "duck" can be both a type of bird and a term used to warn someone of danger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The cement block is falling, and the man looks up, as if he is going to duck to get out of the way. However, instead of ducking, he says "Duck? No, I ordered roast beef." This is humorous because he is confusing the word "duck" (meaning to lower one's head to avoid being hit) with the word "duck" (meaning the bird that is often served roasted).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is about to be hit by the falling cinder block is more concerned with his food order than the impending danger. His companion, who is not in danger, tries to warn him but the man misinterprets his warning as a request to change his order.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is looking at the cinder block about to drop on his companion and he thinks that his companion is trying to make a joke by saying "duck". However, his companion is actually just trying to warn him about the impending danger. The joke is clever because it plays on the fact that "duck" can be both a verb meaning to avoid something, and a type of bird.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man looks up at the falling cement block and mistakes it for a duck. This is a play on the phrase "shoot the duck," which means to do something difficult or pointless. In this case, the man would be trying to shoot the duck (cement block) with his breakfast (roast beef).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is about to be hit by the cinder block thinks his friend is warning him about the food, when in reality his friend is warning him about the impending danger. The joke is a play on the common phrase "look out below!" which is used to warn someone about something falling.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is about to be hit on the head with a cinder block, but he mistakes it for a duck. This is a play on the phrase "dead as a duck", meaning that the man is about to be killed. The joke is also funny because the man is ordering roast beef at a restaurant, and ducks are not typically served as roast beef.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is about to be hit by the cinder block is misinterpreting his companion's warning. Instead of understanding that he needs to duck to avoid being hit, he thinks his companion is warning him that the food they ordered is not what he wanted.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is looking up at the cinderblock about to drop on him is confusing the situation: instead of ducks (which would make sense if this were a restaurant with a hunting theme), he's seeing a concrete block about to fall on him. His companion's roast beef order is also a play on words, as the phrase "duck" can also be used as a verb meaning "to avoid something", which is what the man should do in this situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man looks up at the block falling towards him and instead of ducking (which would be the natural reaction to something falling towards you), he calmly states that he ordered roast beef, not duck. This is confusing because 1) duck is not a type of meat, and 2) even if it was, it would not be falling from the ceiling. The joke is punning on the fact that "duck" can also mean to dodge or avoid something.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="189.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="191.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
