Would you like your plane washed?</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the double meaning of "squad": a squad can refer to a group of cheerleaders, but it can also refer to the pilot and co-pilot of an airplane. In this case, the cheerleader is asking if they want their plane to be "washed" (i.e., cleaned), but the pilots are thinking she's asking if they want to donate to her cheerleading squad.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is incongruous to have a cheerleader near an airplane. One would expect a plane to be near a football field, not a group of people cheering. The joke takes this one step further: the cheerleader is trying to raise money by offering to wash the plane, which is an unusual way to raise money for a cheerleading squad.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is unexpected that a cheerleader would be near an airplane, let alone washing it. Cheerleaders are typically associated with school sports, while airplanes are typically associated with travel. The juxtaposition of the two creates a humorous contrast.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that people often ask for money for various things (such as donations to charities), but the cheerleader is asking for money to wash the plane. This is a bizarre request, and the pilots are probably not expecting it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that some cheerleaders do car washes to fundraise for their squads. In this case, the cheerleader is offering to wash the airplane instead. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the stereotype that cheerleaders are airheaded and not very smart.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cheerleader is offering an unusual service: instead of washing cars or selling cookies, she's offering to wash an airplane. The service is probably not as effective (would it even be possible to wash an airplane?) and is probably not allowed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected. The woman is a cheerleader, and she's out on the runway trying to raise money for her squad by asking people if they want their planes washed. It's a non-traditional way of fundraising, and it's unexpected that she would be doing this on the runway.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected. The pilots of the plane are looking at the cheerleader on the runway, and she takes the opportunity to ask them for money to wash the plane. This is unexpected because people on the runway are not supposed to solicit money from the passengers of the planes.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words; the cheerleader is actually asking if the pilots want their plane to be "washed," as in cleaned, but the pilots are misunderstanding and thinking that she's asking if they want to have sex with her. Of course, it's highly unlikely that a cheerleader would be washing planes or offering sexual favors to pilots, making the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the premise is absurd: a cheerleader is trying to raise money for her squad by offering to wash planes. The idea of a cheerleader being near a plane is already unusual, but the fact that she is trying to wash it makes the situation even more absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the double meaning of "raise": to lift something up, or to earn money. In this case, the cheerleader is offering to wash the plane in order to raise money for her squad. However, because she is on the runway, the pilots are concerned that she might try to wash the plane while it is taking off, which would be very dangerous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cheerleader is attempting to sell a service (plane-washing) to the pilots, who are the people who would actually be able to hire her to do that job. The pilots are clearly not interested, given that they are just staring at her, which makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "airplane wash." An airplane wash is when an airplane is cleaned while it is on the ground. However, the cheerleader is offering to wash the plane while it is in the air, which is impossible. The joke is also clever because it is a fundraiser for the cheerleading squad, and one of the ways that squads raise money is by washing cars.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected for a cheerleader to be near an airplane, let alone washing it. The joke plays on the trope of cheerleaders being perky and helpful, but takes it to an extreme.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is unexpected: a cheerleader washing a plane on the runway is not something that normally happens, and it's even less likely that the pilots would be interested in her services. The joke works because it's a play on the stereotype of cheerleaders being ditzy and not very bright.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
