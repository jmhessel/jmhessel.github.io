Maybe we are being too defensive.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is there to help the team with emotional issues, but in this context, the team is a football team, and the therapist's presence is unnecessary because the team is just trying to figure out how to win their game. The therapist's advice to "hear him out" and "maybe be less defensive" is good advice for emotional issues, but in the context of a football game, it is completely unhelpful and out-of-place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in football, the defense is the team that is trying to stop the other team from scoring, whereas the offense is the team that is trying to score. The joke is playing with the words "defensive" and "offensive" to make a pun. The therapist is telling the team to be less "defensive" and to listen to the other team's "offense".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The term "defensive" can refer to a football team's defense, but it can also refer to a person's emotional state. In this case, the therapist is suggesting that the football team is being too "defensive" in their approach, and that they need to be more open to hearing out their opponents.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="189.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="191.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
