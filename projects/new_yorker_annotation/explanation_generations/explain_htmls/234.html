The fact that he says "he said the patent expired" suggests that he is not the only person in the room, and that the other person (likely the person he was talking to) has left. The joke is funny because it is a non-sequitur: the patent for what? The conversation has moved on, and the man has been left alone with his thoughts... and the giant donut.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is unexpected for someone to be carving a large stone wheel in their living room. The man in the scene is doing just that, and when asked about it, he claims that it is because the patent on the wheel has expired. This is a play on the fact that wheel patents have actually never expired, because the wheel is a fundamental principle of design that cannot be patented.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is unexpected that someone would be carving a stone wheel in their living room. The joke plays on the ambiguity of the word "expired": it could mean that the man's patience for the project has run out, or that the physical expiration date on the stone itself has passed. In either case, it's an unusual sight in a living room, which is typically where one relaxes, not works on a strenuous project.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the other room is considering a giant donut, which would be a very strange thing to do. The fact that the joke says that the patent expired implies that the man is considering stealing the donut, which is even stranger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the other room looks like he's about to eat the giant donut, which would be a lot of calories. The joke is that he's only considering it because the patent for the donut has expired, implying that it's no longer under copyright protection and he can eat it without consequences.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. A "patent" can refer to two things: a legal document that gives someone the exclusive right to make, use, or sell an invention for a certain period of time; or, a physical attribute of something, like the shiny surface of a stone. In this context, the man is chiseling the stone because the patent on the shiny surface has expired, so he's making it matte again.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the other room is considering a giant donut, which would be a called a "wheel" if it were a car. The woman says that the patent expired, meaning that the donut is now public domain and anyone can make it, which is why there is a giant donut in their living room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is looking at the donut as if it's a new invention, but the patent expired, so it's no longer new. He's surprised by this, which implies he's not very familiar with the donut industry or patents in general.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because a man considering a giant donut is strange enough on its own. However, the fact that the joke references a patent expiring implies that the man is considering the donut as something to be eaten, rather than something to be looked at as a sculpture.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In this context, "patent" can refer both to the stone wheel (which is a type of "millstone"), and also to a legal concept of expired patents. The fact that the man is chiseling away at the stone wheel with a hammer is also humorous, because it's something that would be very difficult to do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the nonchalant way the man in the other room refers to the fact that there is a giant donut in the room. The patent expired could refer to the fact that the donut is so big that it's expired, or it could refer to the fact that the design of the donut is so old that the patent has expired. In either case, the joke is clever because it points out the absurdity of the situation in a concise way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is chiseling a stone wheel, which seems like a very old-fashioned and painstaking method of making something that could be easily mass produced now. When the woman asks why he's doing it, he says that the patent expired, implying that he's making it the old-fashioned way because it's now more expensive to make it any other way. The joke is a commentary on the futility of trying to fight progress.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the other room is considering a giant donut, which would be an unusual thing to have in one's house. The fact that the patent on the donut has expired implies that the man has been thinking about this donut for a long time, and is only now considering it because he can no longer be sued for patent infringement.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the other room is looking at a giant donut, which is a sculpture. It's strange that he's considering it, as if he's thinking about eating it, and the fact that he says the "patent expired" suggests that he's aware that it's a sculpture, not a food. The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the man is "considering" the giant donut, but he's also "considering" it in the sense that he's thinking about it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In this context, "patent" can mean either a legal right that gives the inventor of something exclusive use of their invention for a certain period of time, or it can refer to the act of chiseling a stone wheel. The invention in question is the stone wheel itself, and the fact that the man is chiseling it in his living room suggests that he's trying to make a new, improved version that he can then patent.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="233.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="235.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
