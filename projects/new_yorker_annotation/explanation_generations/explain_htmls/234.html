Can you call my cell phone again?</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who walked into the office assumes that the alligator is dead, when really, it's just sleeping. This person's comment about their cell phone is a non-sequitur, but it's funny because it's a typical thing that someone would say when they're not paying attention to their surroundings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the alligator on his desk is trying to act like everything is normal, despite the fact that there is a giant alligator blocking his view of his phone. The alligator is vibrating because it is asleep, and the man is hoping that the noise will wake it up so he can answer his phone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man at the desk is seemingly unaware of the alligator until the other man points it out. The man at the desk then proceeds to ask the other man to call his cell phone, again, as if the alligator is not a big deal. This joke highlights how people can be so wrapped up in their technology that they don't notice their surroundings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man at the desk is feeling the alligator's belly, which is vibrating because alligators often purr when they're happy. The other man thinks the man is feeling his cell phone vibrate, and so he asks him to call it again so that he can feel it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man at the desk with the alligator is asking the other man to call his cell phone again, implying that he has felt a vibration, most likely from his phone. However, the alligator is actually the source of the vibration, as its belly is on top of the desk. The man is ignorant of this fact, which makes the situation humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person with the alligator on their desk is so nonchalant about the situation that they don't even bother to move the alligator before answering their phone. The alligator is so large that it would be difficult to miss, yet the person doesn't seem to think it's worth mentioning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the alligator's belly is so large that it is blocking the view of the man's cellphone. The man is asking the other man to call his cellphone again, seemingly unaware that there is an alligator blocking it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because phones vibrate when they receive calls, and the alligator is lying on top of the man's desk, vibrating it. The man thinks that the alligator is his phone, and so he wants the other man to call him again so that he can feel the vibration.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the alligator on his desk is nonchalant about the situation, even though it would be dangerous and highly unusual. The man even asks the other man to call his cell phone again, implying that this is a regular occurrence that he is used to. This joke pokes fun at the idea that some people are so used to technology that they can't even function without it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is sitting at the desk seems to be unaware of the alligator on top of his desk, despite the alligator being so large. The alligator could be interpreted as a metaphor for the man's workload, which is so large and imposing that he can't even see it. The fact that the alligator is also vibrating implies that the man is so stressed that he's starting to hallucinate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the alligator on his desk is trying to act like it's not a big deal, even asking the other man to call his cell phone again, as if the alligator is just a nuisance and not a massive wild animal. This suggests that the man is in denial about the alligator, which is out of place in an office setting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The alligator is lying on top of the desk, and the man is saying that he feels a vibration, which could either be coming from the phone or from the alligator. However, given the context, it's more likely that the vibration is coming from the alligator, which is why the man asks the other person to call his cell phone again.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man at the desk is feeling the alligator's stomach vibrate, and mistakes it for a cell phone. This is a play on the phrase "I feel a vibration," which often is used to describe the feeling of a cell phone going off when it receives a call or text.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the person's nonchalant reaction to the alligator on their desk, and the person's initial reaction of shock. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the phrase "I feel a connection," which is often said when two people meet and they feel like they have a special bond. In this case, the person feels a connection with the alligator, but it is probably not the same type of connection that the phrase is typically used to describe.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who walks in sees the alligator and is surprised, but the person who is sitting at the desk is not surprised at all. In fact, the person sitting at the desk is so nonchalant about the presence of the alligator that they think the alligator is their cell phone vibrating. This is absurd because, of course, alligators don't vibrate, and it's also implausible that someone would be so used to having an alligator in their office that they wouldn't bat an eye at it.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
