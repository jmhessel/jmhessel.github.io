In this case, the man staring at the two tuba players is not calmed by the music, but agitated, because it's too loud and he can't concentrate on his work. The two tuba players, in turn, are following the elevator music protocol to a tee, by coming in on the fourth floor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man staring at the two men with tubas implies that they are playing music, and specifically elevator music, which is often maligned as being boring or uninspired. In response, one of the musicians says that the other should come in on four, which is a musical term meaning that he should start playing his part four beats after the first musician starts. This joke is clever because it uses a musical term to make a joke about elevator music.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that tubas are often associated with the lowest notes in music. The exchange between the two tuba players and the man implies that the tuba players were coming in on the wrong note (literally), and the man has to tell them to play the correct note.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully pokes at the typical stereotype of classical music being "stuffy" or "old-fashioned." In this case, the joke is that the music (the tubas) are coming into the elevator on the wrong floor (four instead of the first floor). This play on words is humorous because it's unexpected and because it's a clever way to talk about classical music in a modern context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the situation: people in elevators are typically strangers who don't interact much beyond the polite response to the question of what floor they're going to. In this case, the joke is that the man outside the elevator is telling the two men inside what floor to get off on, as if he's the one in charge. The joke relies on the ridiculousness of the situation for its humor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The person outside the elevator wants to come in on the floor four, but the person with the tuba says "no, you come in on four", meaning that the person outside should come in on the fourth floor. The joke is clever because it is a subtle way of telling the person outside that they are not welcome on the elevator.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the man implies that the other man playing the tuba is coming in late on the four beats of the measure. This is a play on the fact that tubas are often played in marching bands, and march to a four-beat measure.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the multiple meanings of the word "come": in a normal scenario, the phrase "come in on four" would mean to enter on the fourth floor. However, in this context, with the two men in the elevator playing tubas, the phrase takes on a double meaning of "to come in" meaning to ejaculate. Consequently, the joke is both a play-on-words and a visual pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is telling the two tuba players that they should come in on the fourth floor, but the word "come" can also be used as a euphemism for sexual intercourse. Therefore, the man is telling the two tuba players that they should have sex on the fourth floor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype of two men in a business meeting who are argue over insignificant details. In this scene, the two men in the elevator are arguing over what floor to come in on, when really, it doesn't matter. The joke is made funnier by the fact that they are both carrying large tuba instruments, which would make it difficult to come in on any floor besides the one they are already on.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In music, "coming in on four" means to start playing at the fourth beat of a measure. However, in this context, "coming in on four" means to come into the elevator on the fourth floor. The fact that the men are wearing tubas makes the joke funnier because it's unexpected and visuals further the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man outside the elevator wants to come in on the "four" floor but the two men inside the elevator are playing music on their tubas. Therefore, the man outside the elevator is actually being asked to come in on the "tuba" floor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man staring at the tuba players is asking them to get off on the fourth floor, but they misunderstand him and think he's asking what note they should play.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is telling the other man that he needs to come in on four, i.e., play the tuba, in order to create the desired muzak effect in the elevator. However, the man's delivery makes it seem like he's telling the other man to get out of the elevator.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the word "tuba." The man is telling the two tuba players that they should come in on the four note (which is a note played on the tuba), but the word "tuba" can also mean a large, awkward person. So the man could also be telling the two large, awkward people that they should come in on the fourth floor.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="56.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="58.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
