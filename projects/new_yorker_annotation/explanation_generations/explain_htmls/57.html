In this case, the woman is talking about a literal fishbowl, which is even more boring and constricting than a goldfish bowl. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the idea of a "castaway": a castaway is a person who is stranded on a deserted island. In this case, the man in the fishbowl is a literal castaway, and the woman is talking about him as if he is a toy that she can just get rid of when she's done with him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is talking about a human being as if he were a goldfish. The implication is that she sees him as a pet that she can get rid of when she gets bored of him, which is dehumanizing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman on the phone is talking about the man in the fishbowl, but the phrase "flush him down the toilet" can also mean to get rid of him or to dispose of him in a very callous way. In this case, the woman is using the phrase in the literal sense, but it's still funny because of the double meaning.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="56.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="58.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
