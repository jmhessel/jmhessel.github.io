However, the fact that he's calm and even somewhat bored implies that this is not an unusual or dangerous situation for him. The joke then takes a turn when he's offered a way to save money, indicating that his execution may not be imminent after all.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common trope of a person being on death row and requesting a call from the governor in order to plead for clemency. In this case, the person is not on death row, but is merely sitting in an electric chair, which is a much more mundane situation. However, the fact that he's hooked up to electrodes gives the situation a sense of foreboding, as if he might be about to be executed. The joke transforms the boring office situation into a life-or-death one.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the electric chair is expecting a call from the governor, which would usually be a bad thing (implying that he is about to be executed), but in this case, the man is hoping that the governor will call to tell him that he is pardoning him, which would be a good thing. However, the man is so bored that he is willing to take a call from a telemarketer, which is usually considered a nuisance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is waiting to see if he will get a call from the governor, which would indicate whether his death sentence will be commuted to life in prison. However, the man is more interested in how much money he could save by switching his phone plan. The joke is a play on the idea that death row inmates are often bored, and thus their minds might wander to unimportant things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is so calm about being in an electric chair that he is even still able to work. The joke also playfully suggests that getting a call from the governor (of the state in which he is being executed) could save him from execution, which is a far-fetched idea.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person is pretending he's going to be executed in the electric chair, but he's really just bored at work. His boss or someone else important is going to call him, but in the meantime, he's trying to save money on his electric bill. The juxtaposition of the electric chair and the mundane task of saving money on bills is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is so bored at work that he's actually excited at the prospect of being executed in the electric chair. This is a play on the common trope of people being bored at work and wishing they could die to escape the boredom.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is casually talking on the phone while sitting in an electric chair, as if it's no big deal. The fact that he is so nonchalant about the situation implies that he's either used to it or that it's not a big deal, which is surprising given that if he's in an electric chair, he's probably about to be executed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man, who is about to be executed in an electric chair, is more concerned with how much money he could save on his phone bill by switching providers. The contrast between the gravitas of the situation and the mundane concerns of the man make it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man in the electric chair is expecting a call from the governor, which in this case means the person who oversees executions in the state. However, the other meaning of governor is a person who manages a business or organization. So, the man is actually talking to a telemarketer, which is why he's suddenly interested in what they have to say.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is being executed in an electric chair, but he is more interested in how much money he could save on his phone bill if he switched to a different service. The man is so bored with his current situation that he is more interested in saving money on his phone bill than the fact that he is about to be executed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common trope of prisoners on death row being given a stay of execution at the last minute. In this case, the man is so bored at work that he's hoping to get a call from the governor telling him he's about to be executed, because it would be more exciting than his current situation. However, the joke takes a turn when he learns that he could save money on his phone bill, which is more exciting to him than a possible execution.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man, who is about to be executed in an electric chair, is talking on the phone about a possible stay of execution with the governor. However, he gets sidetracked when he hears about how much money he could save by switching his phone service. The call from the governor is not as important to him as the potential savings on his phone bill, which is unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a normal scenario, the person in the electric chair would be waiting for a call from the governor to see if they will be granted a stay of execution. However, in this situation, the man is instead waiting for a call from someone offering him a large sum of money, which is juxtaposed with the seriousness of his current situation. The joke is also funny because it playfully subverts the expectations of the audience by having the man be more worried about money than his impending execution.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is hooked up to an electric chair, which is normally used for executions. However, he's calmly reading some documents and says he's expecting a call from the governor. The governor could be calling to stop the execution, which would be a typical plot line in a movie or TV show. However, the man then says that he could save how much money. This suggests that the governor is actually calling about something else entirely, and the man is using the execution as an opportunity to try and get a discount.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="98.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="100.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
