In this case, the therapist is talking to an electric car, which is a newfangled technology, and asking it the same question she would ask a patient suffering from auditory hallucinations. The car's response of "Where do the voices tell you to go?" is humorous because it's a non-answer that furthers the idea that the car is malfunctioning.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the electric car is a metaphor for the patient's mental state: the therapist is asking the car where the patients' voices are telling him to go, in other words, where the patient is being drawn to mentally. The fact that the car is an inanimate object and cannot answer the question makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is trying to psychoanalyze a car. The car is autonomous, which means that it doesn't have a driver, so it's not clear why the therapist is assuming that the car is possessed by voices. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the fact that many people think of cars as inanimate objects, and it's absurd to think that a car could be psychotic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it takes the concept of an electric car (which is strange enough on its own) and juxtaposes it with the concept of therapy (which is often seen as strange or taboo). The fact that the car has a face makes it even stranger, and the therapist's question implies that the car is suffering from some sort of mental illness.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that people who talk to inanimate objects are usually considered crazy. The fact that the therapist is talking to an electric car, which is a new technology, makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that people who suffer from mental illness often hear voices that tell them to do things. The electric car is autonomous, meaning that it can drive itself, and so the joke is that the car is hearing voices that are telling it where to go.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is treating the car as if it were a person who is hearing voices. In this case, the voices are likely the GPS or the car's navigation system. The joke is clever because it's a play on the common stereotype that people who talk to inanimate objects are crazy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the car is suffering from a mental illness and is being treated by the therapist. The therapist is asking the car where the voices tell him to go, just as they would ask a human patient where the voices tell them to go. However, in this case, the voices are likely coming from the GPS system or some other navigation system in the car, rather than from an actual mental illness.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the reality (a car is in a therapist's office) and the expected (a human patient in a therapist's office). The car is strange because it is small and has a face, which makes it look like a toy or child's drawing of a car. The therapist's question implies that the car is sentient and has mental health issues, which is unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idea of a talking car. In this case, the car is talking to the therapist, and the therapist is asking it the same sorts of questions that she would ask a human patient. The punchline is clever because it suggests that the car is hearing voices that tell it where to go, which is a symptom of psychosis.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that people who talk to inanimate objects are usually seen as crazy. However, in this case, the inanimate object is actually a talking car, which is even more unusual. The therapist's question is humorous because it's a play on the fact that usually, people who talk to inanimate objects think that the object is telling them to do something. In this case, the car is actually telling the therapist where to go.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is absurd to see a car in a therapist's office. The therapist is trying to understand why the car is there and why it has a face. This is funny because it is a play on the fact that people often think of cars as inanimate objects that can't do anything on their own, when in reality, they are increasingly autonomous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Voices" in this context can refer to either the thoughts in somebody's head or an external auditory hallucination. However, because the patient is a car, the "voices" are actually the GPS directions that the car is receiving. Thus, the therapist is asking the car where the GPS is telling it to go.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's absurd to think that a car would need therapy, let alone be capable of understanding human language. However, in this case, the therapist is treating the car as if it were a human patient, asking it questions about the voices it hears. This is a play on the fact that many people believe that cars are becoming increasingly sentient and may one day be able to understand and respond to human emotions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reversal of the traditional therapist-patient relationship. In this case, the "patient" is a car, and the therapist is asking it about the voices it hears. This is a play on the fact that autonomous cars are often controlled by computers, which could be seen as akin to humans hearing voices.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="98.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="100.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
