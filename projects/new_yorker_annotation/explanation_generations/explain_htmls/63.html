What's your excuse?</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it suggests that the robots are only voting yes because they've been programmed to do so, while the human is voting yes because he's an idiot. This is a play on the stereotype that robots are mindless automatons, while humans are thinking, feeling beings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that robots are idiots. The boss is angry with the one human who is voting yes, because he is betraying the humans, and he asks what his excuse is. The joke suggests that the reason the person is voting yes is because he's as dumb as the robots.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the context of a room full of robots and humans, the "idiots" the boss is referring to are the robots. The joke pokes fun at the stereotype that robots are unintelligent and/or taking over human jobs, by suggesting that even the robots programmed to be idiots are outperforming the one human in the room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common fears about robots taking over and becoming intelligent enough to do human jobs. In this case, the robots are so stupid that they're voting yes on a proposition that will probably fail, and the human is being compared to them. The joke implies that the human is as stupid as the robots, which is why the boss is mad at him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is true: robots are programmed to do what they are told, so they are not capable of making their own decisions. However, the implication is that the person who is voting yes is an idiot, which is why the boss is mad at him. This joke pokes fun at the idea of a robot takeover, by suggesting that the robots are actually far less capable than the humans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is implying that the person who voted yes is as dumb as the robots, and is thus just as much to blame for the bad decision as they are.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a jab at the person who is voting yes on the proposition, suggesting that they are as unintelligent as the robots. This is ironic because, in most cases, it would be assumed that the robots are programmed to be smarter than humans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a criticism of the robots, who are clearly outvoted, but it's also a jab at the one person who is voting with the robots. The person is being called an idiot for voting with the robots, even though they are programmed to be idiots.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "the robots are coming to take our jobs." In this case, the robots have taken the jobs of the humans in the meeting, and are now voting on company matters. The joke is also funny because it's a jab at the person who is voting with the robots, implying that they are as dumb as the robots, or perhaps even dumber.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is accusing the person who voted yes of being as dumb as the robots. The robots are programmed to vote yes, but the person is not, so the boss is insinuating that the person is too stupid to know any better.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it points out the hypocrisy of the boss: he's mad at the one person for voting with the robots, but he shouldn't be surprised because he just acknowledged that the robots are programmed to do so. The boss is insulting the intelligence of both the robots and the person who is voting with them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is implying that the robot is more intelligent than the person who is voting yes, which is a very demeaning thing to say. The boss is also implying that the person who is voting yes is a mindless follower, which is why he is mad at him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss implies that the robots are only voting yes because they've been programmed to do so, whereas the human is voting yes of their own accord. This implies that the boss thinks the human is as stupid as the robots, if not more so.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the person who is voting yes is as dumb as the robots, who are voting yes because they've been programmed to do so. The boss is exasperated because, presumably, the human shouldn't be so easily swayed and should use their own judgement.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Higgins is the only human voting in favor of the proposition, while the robots are all voting against it. The robots are programmed to be idiots, as the boss said, which is why they are voting the way they are. The boss is implying that Higgins is also an idiot for voting the way he did, even though he doesn't have an excuse like the robots do.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="62.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="64.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
