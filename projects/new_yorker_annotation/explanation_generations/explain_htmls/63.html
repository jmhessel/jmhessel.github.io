"Sitting ducks" is a idiom meaning "an easy target." In this case, the target is the ducks, and they are easy because they are sitting in the seats with their laptops open. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the Infinite Monkey Theorem, which posits that if you have enough monkeys typing on enough keyboards, they will eventually write a work of Shakespeare. In this case, the ducks have laptops, but they are not typing, making them unlikely to produce any great works of literature.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the phrase "sitting ducks." In this scene, the ducks are actually sitting in the seats, so the joke is a play on words. The joke is also funny because it's a pun on the Infinite Monkey Theorem, which states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter for an infinite amount of time will eventually produce the complete works of Shakespeare. In this case, the Ducks are using laptops, which are a type of computer, so the joke is that if you take away the computers, the ducks will just be sitting there with nothing to do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Sitting ducks" is a idiom meaning "one that is especially vulnerable to attack", which can be applied to the birds in the seats, but is also a literal description of what the birds are doing. The fact that the birds are in a lecture hall and are using laptops is also funny because it's unexpected and strange.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In the situation, the ducks are sitting at computers; if you take away the computers, then they're just sitting ducks. This is a pun because "sitting ducks" is also a term used to describe people or animals who are easy targets. Thus, the joke is cleverly pointing out that the ducks are easy targets for the scientists because they aren't very smart.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "sitting ducks" is often used to describe people who are easy targets, and in this situation, the ducks are literally sitting in the seats where the students would be. However, the addition of laptops in front of the ducks suggests that they are not just ordinary ducks, but rather, they are student ducks who are using the laptops to do their work. The joke cleverly combines the two meanings of the phrase "sitting ducks."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a pun on the idiom "sitting duck", which means an easy target. In this case, the ducks are literally sitting ducks because they are, well, sitting ducks. But they are also sitting ducks in the sense that they are easy targets for the experiment the two scientists are conducting. The computers are necessary for the experiment, but without them, the ducks are just regular ducks.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a pun on the phrases "sitting ducks" and "sitting in front of laptops." The birds in front of the laptops are vulnerable to being attacked because they are not paying attention to their surroundings. The phrase "sitting ducks" is often used to describe people or animals who are easy targets.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "sitting duck" is often used to describe a person or thing that is an easy target, and in this case, the joke is that the ducks are indeed easy targets --- but only because they are preoccupied with their computers and not paying attention to their surroundings. If the computers were taken away, they would just be regular ducks, not sitting ducks.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "sitting ducks" is a idiom which means "an easy target". In this scene, the birds are literally sitting ducks because they are ducks that are sitting down. However, because they are also in front of laptops, the phrase takes on a second meaning of them being an easy target for the scientists conducting the experiment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it puns on the phrase "sitting ducks", which means people who are easy targets. In this case, the "sitting ducks" are the birds in the seats, since they are not using their computers. The joke also plays on the fact that "duck" is another word for "laptop", and so the birds in the seats could also be interpreted as laptops.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "sitting ducks": in the context of the classroom, "sitting ducks" refers to the fact that the ducks are sitting in the seats where the students would be, and are thus easy targets. However, in the context of the ducks using laptops, "sitting ducks" refers to the fact that they are vulnerable to being targeted by predators (in this case, the people in lab coats). The joke is also a play on the "infinite monkey theorem", which posits that a monkey pressing keys at random on a typewriter for an infinite amount of time will eventually produce the entire works of Shakespeare. In this case, the ducks are producing Shakespearean-level work, which is why they are targeted.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. In the context of the scene, the word "ducks" refers to the actual ducks sitting at the computers. However, the word "ducks" can also mean "easy targets." So, the joke is saying that if you take away the computers, the ducks will be easy targets because they aren't smart.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "sitting duck" is often used to describe someone who is an easy target, while in this case, the "sitting ducks" are the actual ducks that are sitting in the seats. The joke cleverly ties in the concept of the infinite monkey theorem, which posits that a monkey typing randomly on a keyboard will eventually produce a work of Shakespeare, to the ducks, which are also sitting in front of keyboards.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "sitting ducks" is a idiom meaning "an easy target". The phrase comes from the sport of duck hunting, where hunters would shoot ducks that were sitting in the water. In this scenario, the ducks are literally sitting in the seats, and they also have laptops open in front of them, making them easy targets for the two people in lab coats.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. In the situation, the ducks are using computers, but if you take away the computers, they are just sitting ducks. This is a pun because the word "ducks" can mean both the animal, and a term for a bad Bowlers score of zero ("a duck"). So, without the computers, the ducks are both figuratively and literally sitting ducks.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="62.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="64.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
