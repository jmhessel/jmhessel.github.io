This is because vacuum cleaners are usually perceived as being dangerous because they can suck things up, whereas werewolves are usually perceived as being dangerous because they can kill people. However, in reality, werewolves are not real and so they can't actually hurt anyone, whereas vacuum cleaners are real and can actually suck things up, making them more dangerous in a practical sense.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is clearly scared of the monster, despite the fact that it is less fearsome than a common household appliance. This play on words is humorous because it is a contrast to what the man is feeling versus what the reasonable thing to feel would be.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a comparison of two things that are very different in terms of scariness. A vacuum cleaner is not typically considered to be a scary thing, while a monster is. The joke is humorous because it is a play on the fact that people often have various irrational fears.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is saying that the dog is afraid of something that doesn't exist (monsters), but not afraid of something that does exist (vacuum cleaners). This implies that the man thinks vacuum cleaners are more dangerous than monsters, even though vacuum cleaners are not alive and can't hurt you.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a common thing for dogs to be scared of vacuum cleaners, which are much less imposing than a giant werewolf-like creature. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words: the man is asking the dog why it is scared of the vacuum cleaner, but the word "vacuum" can also be a verb meaning "to remove all traces of something", as in "the dog's fear of vacuum cleaners was vacuumed away by the therapist".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The vacuum cleaner is called a "monster" in this joke, but it is not a real monster like the werewolf in front of them. The man is scared of the vacuum cleaner because it is a big, noisy machine, but it is not actually dangerous. In contrast, the werewolf is a real monster that is actually dangerous, but the man is not scared of it. This contrast is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the vacuum cleaner is a much less intimidating thing than a monster, but the man's dog is afraid of the vacuum cleaner. The joke is making fun of the man for being afraid of the vacuum cleaner, when he should be more afraid of the monster.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is surprised that his dog is scared of the vacuum cleaner, yet not scared of the monster. The joke pokes fun at the idea that dogs are afraid of things that are seemingly harmless, like vacuum cleaners.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common fear of dogs, which are usually seen as friendly, while werewolves are usually seen as scary. In this case, the man is more scared of the vacuum cleaner, which is usually seen as inoffensive, than the werewolf, which is supposed to be scary. The joke is funny because it's a reversal of the expected reaction.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's reaction to the monster is more rational than the dog's reaction to the vacuum cleaner. The joke is clever because it's using a word (scared) that can apply to both the dog's reaction to the vacuum cleaner and the man's reaction to the monster: the dog is scared of the vacuum cleaner because it's afraid of the noise it makes, whereas the man is scared of the monster because it's a frightening and dangerous creature.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is pointing out the irony that his dog is scared of something much less dangerous than the werewolf that they are currently facing. The vacuum cleaner is a common household appliance that cannot hurt or kill anyone, whereas the werewolf is a mythical creature that is often associated with being dangerous and deadly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's initial reaction to seeing the monster is underwhelming; instead of being scared or surprised, he dryly comments on the irony that his dog is afraid of something much less threatening. This joke could be funnier if the vacuum cleaner were, in fact, a more threatening object, such as a gun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog is scared of the werewolf, but the man is more annoyed than scared. This is likely because the man knows that werewolves are not real, whereas the dog does not. The dog's fear is irrational and thus amusing to the man.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is more worried about his dog being scared of the vacuum cleaner than the werewolf that's RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM. The difference in reaction is funny because the vacuum cleaner, while potentially dangerous, is not nearly as dangerous as a werewolf, and so the man's priorities are skewed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is talking to the dog, but he could just as easily be talking to the monster. The vacuum cleaner is a metaphor for the monster: it's big and scary, but it's not actually going to hurt you. This joke is reassuring the dog (and by extension, the monster) that there's nothing to be afraid of.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
