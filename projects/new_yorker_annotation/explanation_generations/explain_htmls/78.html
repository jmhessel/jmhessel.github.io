He is probably there for a meeting, but has come straight from surfing and is still carrying his surfboard. He is telling the secretary that his previous engagement got cancelled or ran late, and now he is there for his 1:30 meeting. The secretary is probably surprised to see him and his surfboard.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Gnarly" is a slang term meaning "difficult" or "challenging", often used in relation to sports like surfing; in this case, the man is telling his secretary that his 1:30 meeting got extremely challenging, or "gnarly". The joke is clever because it's a double meaning: not only is the man telling his secretary that the meeting was difficult, he's also saying that he went surfing during the meeting, which is why he's carrying a surfboard.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man carrying the surfboard is telling the secretary that his 1:30 meeting got "way gnarly" meaning it got really chaotic and intense. However, "gnarly" is also a surfing term meaning really good waves. So the man is either saying that the meeting was really good, or it was really bad. Either way, it's unexpected that he would be carrying a surfboard in the office.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="77.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="79.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
