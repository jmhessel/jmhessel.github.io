In this case, the small event was feeding a cat a can of Fancy Feast, and the much larger event was the cat becoming king. The idea of a cat becoming king is absurd, which is why the joke is funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat being crowned king is absurd. It's made even funnier by the fact that the cat is named after a brand of cat food, which implies that the cat is just a regular animal that has been given a regal title.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is so overweight that it's comical, and because it's wearing a crown, which implies that it's of high status. The joke is also a play on words, because "fancy feast" is a brand of cat food, and the cat is clearly overfed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat's owners are acting as if the cat is a king, when in reality, cats are just pets. The joke suggests that the cat's owners are delusional, or that they are putting too much importance on their pet.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat's regal outfit and demeanor make it clear that he thinks he's a king. The man and woman's interaction with the cat implies that they've indulged his fantasy by playing along with it, but the joke is that it all started with something as simple as giving him Fancy Feast cat food, which implies that the cat is not actually a king.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The couple is looking at the fat cat and the woman looks concerned. The woman is concerned about the cat's weight, which is a play on the word "feast." Fancy Feast is a brand of cat food, which is what the cat has been eating to become so fat. The joke is clever because it is both a play on words and a play on the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat becoming king is such an unexpected and absurd event. It's made even funnier by the fact that the cat's owner says that it all started with the cat eating Fancy Feast, which is a brand of cat food. The joke is implying that the cat food is so good that it made the cat become king.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the couple started dressing up their cat like a king because they were overindulging him with fancy meals. The joke is a play on the saying "it all started with a bang," which is often used to describe the beginning of something big or significant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The Fancy Feast is a type of cat food, but it's also a term used to describe a lavish, formal meal. In this case, the cat food has caused the cat to be crowned king, which is a very fancy and formal title. Thus, the joke is that the cat's owners are over-the-top in their celebration because they are treating the cat like it's a human being, when really it's just a pet.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in real life, a cat would never be crowned king. The fact that this cartoon cat is crowned king makes it humorous, because it's an absurd situation. The rationale behind the cat becoming king, as stated in the joke, is also absurd: the cat became king because it ate Fancy Feast, which is a brand of cat food. This sends the message that the situation is so absurd that even the explanation for it is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple's cat has gotten so fat that it now resembles a king or other sort of royalty. The cat's size is also a bit unusual, as most cats are not as large as the one in the cartoon. The joke likely plays off of the stereotype that cats are lazy and uninterested in physical activity, as the cat has become so large from eating too much food.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple's cat is dressed up like a king. The joke is playing on the fact that the cat is acting like he's royalty, and the couple is humoring him. The fact that the couple is humoring the cat implies that they've given into his demands (such as being fed Fancy Feast cat food), which is what has led to the cat's regal behavior.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "fancy feast" is a type of food often given to cats, and in this case, the "fancy feast" is what led to the cat being crowned king. The joke is a play on the phrase "It all started with a small idea", meaning that the cat's ascension to royalty began with a seemingly innocuous act.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The Fancy Feast is a type of cat food, but it's also a phrase that means an ornate or grand feast, usually fit for a king or other royalty. In this case, the cat food has led to the cat becoming actual royalty, which is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "fancy feast" is a type of cat food, but it's also a type of feast that would befit a king. So, the joke is that the cat became king because its owners started feeding it a brand of food that is associated with royalty.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="77.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="79.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
