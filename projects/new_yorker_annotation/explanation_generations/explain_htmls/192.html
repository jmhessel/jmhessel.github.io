The word "mauve" can be used to describe a light purple color, but it is also a homophone for "move." In other words, the receptionist cow is telling the waiting cows to move their legs so they are no longer crossing them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the bull erupting into the living room is a very unexpected and violent reaction to seeing the color red. The cow's suggestion that they could try a different color is absurd because it's not as if the bull is going to calm down and have a conversation about color theory. The joke is also funny because mauve is a very unexpected color to suggest; it's not usually associated with bulls or with the color red.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the two different settings: a normal waiting room and a room full of cows. The fact that the cows are sitting in a waiting room and one is acting as a receptionist is already strange, but the fact that they are crossing their legs makes it even stranger. The joke is based on the idea that the cows are trying to act like humans, but they are failing miserably.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the receptionist cow is suggesting that the waiting cows choose a different color for their couch. Cows are often associated with the color black and white, so the suggestion of mauve, a purple color, is unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cows are sitting in a waiting room like people, but one of them is asking the receptionist for a color suggestion for their living room. This is funny because cows are not usually associated with having a living room, or with making design decisions for said living room. The joke also plays on the fact that mauve is a color that is often associated with cows, as it is a light purple color.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The color mauve is often associated with the color of cows, so the receptionist cow is asking if the other cows have considered the color mauve. But, of course, cows can't actually think about colors because they don't have the capacity for human cognition.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the color mauve is not typically associated with cows. Cows are more often seen as being a brown or black color. Therefore, the suggestion that they change the color of their curtains to mauve is unexpected and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non-sequitur. The receptionist cow asks the waiting cows if they have thought about mauve, a color, which has nothing to do with why the cows are waiting or what they are doing. The joke implies that the receptionist cow is not very good at her job, and is making small talk instead of attending to the cows' needs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the receptionist cow is asking the other cows if they want to try a different color, which implies that the cows are there to get their hooves painted. Cows are not usually associated with getting their hooves painted, so the idea of cows in a nail salon is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The receptionist cow is asking the other cows what color they want their nails painted, and the color she suggests is mauve. However, "mauve" is also a homophone for "moo," which is the sound that cows make. So, the joke is that the cows are getting their nails painted, but the receptionist is also suggesting that they make the sound that cows make.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the receptionist cow is asking the other cows if they've considered mauve, which is a type of purple. The joke is funny because it's unexpected --- usually when someone asks if you've considered something, they are asking about an idea or plan, but in this case, the receptionist cow is asking about a color.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the mauve color is often associated with cows, as the color is similar to the color of their fur. The joke implies that the cows are waiting to see a color wheel/paint swatches to pick out a new color for their living room, and mauve is a option. This is funny because it's a play on the stereotype that cows are not very bright.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non-sequitur. The fact that the cow is suggesting a different color for the curtains implies that the bull's reaction to the red curtains is unreasonable, and that there are other, more appropriate solutions. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the common phrase "seeing red", which is often used to describe someone who is angry.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because mauve is a color often associated with cows, as the mauve cow is a famous variety of cow. The joke is implying that the cow receptionist is telling the other cows to consider mauve as a color option, because it would suit them well.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The color mauve is often associated with cows, so the receptionist cow is suggesting that the other cows consider mauve as a color for their hide. However, the word "moo" is also a homophone for "mauve," so the joke could also be interpreted as the receptionist cow telling the other cows to make the noise cows typically make.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
