The joke is also funny because it is a play on words: the caveman is both literally and figuratively describing the tower.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman's comment about the tower scraping the sky is a non-sequitur. The comment is also funny because it's a play on words --- the Tower of Pisa is a famous landmark that is notable because it leans to one side, and the caveman's comment suggests that the tower is leaning to the side because it is scraping the sky.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the contrast between the caveman's short, staccato sentence and the grandiose scale of the tower. The caveman's sentence is also funny because it is a non-sequitur --- the tower doesn't scrape the sky, it just reaches really high.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="216.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="218.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
