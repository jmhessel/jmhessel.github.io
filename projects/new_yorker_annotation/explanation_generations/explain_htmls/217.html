However, the fact that the person's insurance doesn't cover it points to the idea that insurance companies often don't cover things that are out of the ordinary, even if they are technically possible.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is in a prehistoric time period, so he couldn't have insurance that would cover him for a dinosaur biting his leg. In this situation, the caveman is worried about the cost of his medical bills, and his insurance not covering prehistoric conditions is the punchline.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is being bitten by a dinosaur, which is a prehistoric condition, but his insurance doesn't cover it. The joke is clever because it plays on the double meaning of "prehistoric": both the time period in which dinosaurs lived and the time period before written history.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is impossible: dinosaurs and cavemen did not exist at the same time. Therefore, the man's insurance company would not cover an attack by a dinosaur because it would not be considered a real, legitimate threat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, of course, the man's insurance company would not cover a prehistoric condition like being bitten by a dinosaur; that would fall under the category of "unforeseeable accidents." However, the man in the joke is clearly surprised and unhappy that his insurance doesn't cover this, which just goes to show how unexpected and unbelievable the situation is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, typically, insurance companies will not cover something if it's not considered "normal." In this case, the reptile bite is not something that is considered normal, or something that would be covered by insurance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the dinosaur biting his leg is surprised that his insurance policy doesn't cover the prehistoric condition. This is silly because, of course, insurance companies would not cover something that doesn't exist and is therefore not covered by any policy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who is being attacked by the reptile is worried about their insurance. Prehistoric conditions are not covered by insurance because they don't exist anymore. However, the fact that the person is being attacked by a prehistoric reptile means that they are technically covered, because the attack is happening in the present.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully points out the absurdity of the situation: a caveman being bitten by a dinosaur in a cave. The caveman is worried about his insurance not covering the condition, which is a real-world concern, but is humorous because it's a prehistoric creature that he's worried about.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's comment implies that being bitten by a dinosaur is a common occurrence that would be covered by insurance, when in fact, it's not only not common, but also not possible because dinosaurs are extinct. The joke plays on the idea that insurance companies find any way possible to not cover claims.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's injury is being caused by a dinosaur, which is a prehistoric condition. The insurance doesn't cover it because it's something that happened before insurance even existed. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the common phrase "pre-existing conditions," which is a term used in the insurance industry.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because being attacked by a dinosaur is, technically, a "prehistoric condition." However, in the modern day, most insurance companies don't cover conditions that are so old. So, the joke is that even if this caveman's insurance did cover prehistoric conditions, they still wouldn't be covered because the attack happened in the prehistoric past.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common phrase "preexisting conditions." In the context of health insurance, a pre-existing condition is a health problem that a person has before applying for insurance. In this case, the joke is that the person being attacked by the reptile has a "prehistoric condition" --- meaning, the condition (being attacked by a reptile) is so old that it's not covered by insurance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the dinosaur biting his leg is trying to downplay the severity of the situation by comparing it to a 'prehistoric condition,' which insurance companies wouldn't cover. The irony is that the situation is actually prehistoric, so his insurance company would truly not cover it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually, health insurance only covers "modern" conditions and illnesses. In this caveman scenario, the writer is pointing out the ridiculousness of the idea that health insurance would cover something like being bitten by a prehistoric reptile.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="216.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="218.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
