The man is not a "big cat person" because he is tiny, not because he doesn't like cats. The fact that he is fending off an aggressive cat with a sewing needle is also funny because it's an unlikely weapon to use against a cat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is not big, and he is not a fan of big cats. The needle he is holding is also big, in contrast to his small size.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is very clearly not a big cat person, given that he is fighting off an aggressive cat with nothing but a sewing needle. He is likely to lose the fight, which makes his comment even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is not "a big cat person" because he is literally very small, and also because he does not like cats. The fact that he is pointing a needle at a cat makes it even funnier, because it is an aggressive act usually done to a person, not an animal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur. The man is defending himself against a big cat with a tiny needle, and in contrast to the big cat, he is very small. He says he doesn't like big cats, which is unrelated to the situation. It's also possible that he just doesn't like cats in general, which would make his statement even more non-sequitur.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the phrase "I'm not a big fan of cats." In the context of the scene, the man is not a big person, and he is clearly afraid of the cat, which is larger than he is. The joke plays on the fact that the man is not a big fan of cats, in the sense that he is not a fan of them because they are bigger than him and they scare him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The tiny man is not a big person, and he is also not a big fan of cats. The word "person" is replaced with "cat", making the statement humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is clearly scared of the cat, despite the fact that cats are typically smaller than human beings. The man's fear is disproportionate to the cat's size, making the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is trying to fight off a cat with a sewing needle, which is not a very effective weapon against a cat. The man's comment about not being a "big cat person" is a play on words, because the man himself is very small.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the small man is trying to sew the giant cat's mouth shut. The man says he's not a big cat person, which is a pun on the fact that he is very small.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the tiny man is trying to sew up the giant cat, but he is clearly not enjoying it. He is also not very good at it, as evidenced by the fact that the cat is still pawing at the needle and has its mouth open. The man's small size relative to the cat and the giant sewing needle is also a source of humor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is very small and the cat is very large. The man is also holding a needle, which could be used to sew the cat's mouth shut. This would be bad for the cat, as it would no longer be able to eat. The man is thus saying that he doesn't like cats, because he doesn't want to have to sew their mouths shut.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is not a "big" cat person, meaning he does not like cats very much. However, he is literally a "big" cat person, meaning he is much larger than the cat. In this respect, the joke is a example of an absurd situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non-sequitur. The small man looks like he is about to be attacked by the cat, but instead of saying something that would be relevant to the situation, he says that he doesn't like cats. This is a non-sequitur because it doesn't address the fact that he is about to be attacked by a cat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity between the tiny size of the man and the giant size of the cat. It would normally be the other way around, with a giant man and a tiny cat. The fact that the man is not a "big cat person" despite the giant cat in front of him is humorous.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="216.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="218.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
