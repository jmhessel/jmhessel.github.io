The dinosaur in line is an archaeopteryx, which was a real dinosaur that lived during the time of the dinosaurs. However, the author misspells it as "archeopteryx", which is how the word is pronounced. This misspelling makes it sound like the author is trying to make a joke about the dinosaur, which is funny because it's not clear if the author knows that dinosaurs are real.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the author is signing books for people in line, but the dinosaur at the front of the line is not holding a book. When the author asks for the dinosaur's name so she can sign it, the dinosaur angrily roars, sending the line of people scattering. The joke is also a play on words, because the author is signing books for the people in line, but the dinosaur's name, Archaeopteryx, is similar to the word "author".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the fact that dinosaurs are extinct. The fact that there is a dinosaur at the book signing is already unusual, so the joke is exaggerating that fact by having the dinosaur be unable to spell the author's name. The fact that the Dino can't spell the name also implies that it can't read, which further emphasizes how unusual it is for there to be a dinosaur at a book signing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the author is signing books for a very large and out-of-place fan, who is dressed as a dinosaur. The dinosaurs name is Archaeopteryx, which is a type of dinosaur that is widely considered to be the ancestor of birds. Thus, the joke is playing on the fact that the fan is both a dinosaur and a bird.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually when people are getting an autograph, they want it spelled correctly. However, in this case, the autograph seeker doesn't care how it's spelled, as long as they have evidence that they got the author's autograph. The fact that the author is signing for a dinosaur further emphasizes how unimportant correct spelling is in this context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The author is signing books for people, and the giant lizard is in line for a book. The creature's name is Archaeopteryx, which is a type of bird. The joke is that the name is pronounced "ar-KAY-op-ter-ix," but it is spelled like it would be pronounced in Spanish, "ar-kay-OP-ter-ix."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the autograph seeker at the front of the line is a dinosaur, which would be impossible in the present day. The author, trying to be helpful, provides the name of the dinosaur for spelling purposes, but it is a long and difficult name. The dinosaur, getting impatient, would just want a quick and simple autograph.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the author is signing a book for a dinosaur, who is presumably not literate. The fact that the dinosaur is at the book signing and is spelled similarly to "just like it sounds" implies that the dinosaur is there for the same reason as other fans: to meet the author. However, since the dinosaur can't read, the joke is that the author is signing a book that the dinosaur won't be able to appreciate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "Archaeopteryx" is the name of the first known bird, which is also a kind of dinosaur. The fact that the dinosaur in the line is Spell-checking the author's name suggests that it is very intelligent, which is not what one would typically expect from a dinosaur. The dinosaur's anger could be because it is frustrated with how its species is often depicted in popular media, as stupid animals.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the author is signing books for people, but the people in line are not human --- they are dinosaurs. The author is signing the books for the dinosaurs, specifically the Archaeopteryx, which is a kind of dinosaur. But because the author is human and the dinosaurs are not, the author doesn't know how to spell the name of the dinosaur, which is why he spells it like it sounds.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that the dinosaur's name, "Godzilla", is hard to spell. The author is asking the dinosaur to spell his name, "Archaeopteryx", which is a difficult name for a human to spell, let alone a dinosaur.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it uses the fact that dinosaurs are extinct to play on the fact that the person in line is a "fan" of the author. The author, in signing a book for the "fan," makes a joke about how the "fan" probably can't read. This is funny because it's true: if the person in line is a dinosaur, then they probably can't read because they don't know how to read human languages.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the author is signing a book for a giant lizard, who is not an expected customer for a book signing. In addition, the lizard is named after a kind of bird, which is also unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the word "author." In this case, the author is signing books for people, but the dinosaur at the front of the line is actually an author as well, spelling his name the way it sounds. The woman behind the desk is surprised to see a dinosaur author, but goes along with it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the author's name is similar to the word "archeopteryx," which is the name of a kind of lizard. The lizard in front of the author is thus a fitting stand-in for the people in line, who are waiting to get their books signed.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
