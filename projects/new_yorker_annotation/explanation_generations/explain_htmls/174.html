This is contrasted with the reality that most people would find a story about someone else's cat to be quite boring. The joke relies on the contrast between the expected reaction and the actual reaction for its humor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is reading a book, and the man is talking to her, implying that he is telling her a story. The woman's response implies that the story is boring, and the man is not aware of it. This is funny because it is a common situation: people telling stories that they think are interesting, but the listeners are not finding them interesting at all.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's deadpan delivery implies that the story wasn't actually boring, and the man is just being paranoid. The joke could also be interpreted as the woman being sarcastic, and the man not realizing it.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="173.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="175.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
