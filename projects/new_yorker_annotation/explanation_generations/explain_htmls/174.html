I'm going as a pilgrim.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one dog is pointing out that the other dog's cone is ineffective, because it's on backwards. The joke is a play on words, because a "pilgrim" is someone who journeys to a holy place for religious reasons, and a "satellite dish" is a type of antenna that receives television signals from satellites. In the context of the joke, the pilgrim is the dog with the ineffective cone, who is not receiving television signals (i.e., not stopping him from scratching), while the satellite dish is the other dog, whose cone iseffective.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog on the right is wearing the cone backwards, making it look like a satellite dish. The dog on the left is wearing the cone properly, making it look like a pilgrim's hat. This is a play on words, because "pilgrim" can mean both a person who makes a religious journey, and a person from the past.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The dog with the cone on backwards is "going" as a satellite dish, meaning it's going to be a piece of equipment that television signals are received by. However, because the cone is on backwards, it won't actually be able to receive any signals. The other dog is "going" as a pilgrim, meaning it's going to dress up like someone who made a religious pilgrimage. However, because dogs are not religious, the dog won't actually be able to dress up like a pilgrim.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one dog is going trick-or-treating as a pilgrims and the other is going as a satellite dish. The pilgrim is a historically religious figure while the satellite dish is a more modern item. This is a contrast in old and new which can be seen as funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it assumes that the dog with the cone on backwards is going as a satellite dish for Halloween, when in fact they are just wearing the cone to stop them from scratching. The other dog is going as a pilgrim, which is a sensible costume choice for a dog. The contrast between the two dogs' costumes is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the Thanksgiving connection --- a traditional holiday in the United States where people dress up as Pilgrims, who were English settlers that journeyed to the New World in the 1600s. The dog with the cone on backwards is humorous because it can't properly function as a Elizabethan collar, which is meant to protect against scratching, and is instead just a regular cone. The dog dressed as a pilgrim is also humorous because it is anachronistic: Pilgrims didn't have dogs as companions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it imagines the conversation the two dogs might be having if they could talk. One dog is pointing out how the cone on the other dog's head is facing the wrong way, and how that means the other dog is going to "suffer" because he won't be able to scratch himself. In contrast, the first dog is happily pointing out that he is going as a pilgrim, which is a coincidentally apt costume given the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In this scenario, the dog on the right is wearing an Elizabethan collar, which is also called a "cone of shame." The dog on the left is making a joke that the cone on the right dog's head looks like a satellite dish, which is a type of pilgrim hat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog with the cone around its head is wearing it like a satellite dish, which is a type of technology that is used to receive signals from far away. In contrast, the other dog is wearing a cone that is backwards, which is more like the type of cone that a pilgrim would wear. This is a play on words because the word "pilgrim" can also mean a journey or a long way to travel.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The dog on the right is wearing what's called an "Elizabethan collar," which is placed around an animal's neck to prevent them from licking a wound or injury. The dog on the left is making a joke that the other dog is going as a satellite dish, because the cone looks like a satellite dish. But, of course, thedog on the right is actually going as a pilgrim, which is a person who makes a journey to a sacred place. The joke is clever because it's a double meaning that makes you think about the pilgrims' journey to the New World.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the two different ways to interpret "pilgrim." One meaning is the traditional religious sense, in which a pilgrim is someone who makes a journey to a holy place. The other meaning is the colloquial sense, in which a pilgrim is someone who is old-fashioned or out of date. In this case, the dog on the right is dressed as a satellite dish, which is a more modern object, while the dog on the left is dressed as a pilgrim, which has connotations of being old-fashioned.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog on the right, with the cone on backwards, is going as a satellite dish. This is a play on words because, in order to be a satellite dish, the cone would need to be facing the right way, to receive signals. However, because it's on backwards, it would be useless as a satellite dish. The dog on the left is going as a pilgrim, which is a normal, non-humorous costume for a dog to wear.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the dogs is wearing his cone backwards, making it ineffective in stopping him from scratching. The other dog points this out by saying that he's going as a pilgrim, a reference to the pilgrims who came to America on the Mayflower. The joke is also funny because, even though the pilgrims were supposed to be religious people, they were also known for being very dysfunctional.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The dog on the left says "you're going as a satellite dish?" in response to the dog on the right's cone, which resembles a satellite dish. The dog on the right misunderstood and thinks that the dog on the left is asking what he's going as for Halloween. The dog on the right says he's going as a Pilgrim, which is ironic because Pilgrims are usually depicted as wearing hats with a Buckled brim, and not cones.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the dog with the cone around its head is dressed up as a pilgrim, which is a reference to the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States. The other dog, with the cone around its head backwards, is dressed up as a satellite dish, which is a reference to the fact that many people watch television on Thanksgiving. The pilgrim dog is confused because it doesn't understand why the other dog is dressed up as a satellite dish.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="173.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="175.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
