The baseball players in her living room have forced her to take up a batting stance, and she tells the person on the phone that she has to hang up because she's "on deck" --- in other words, she's next up to bat. The fact that she's on the phone while this is happening adds an element of absurdity to the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the homophones "hang up" and "on deck". In baseball, "on deck" refers to the batter who is next up to bat. However, in this context, the woman is "on deck" to be the next victim of the baseball players, who are terrorizing her living room.
