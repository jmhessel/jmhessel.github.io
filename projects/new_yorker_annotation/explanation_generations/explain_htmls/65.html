The irony is that the doctor is trying to break the law (i.e., rob the safe) but the only person who could help her is someone who has already been caught and punished for breaking the law.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is trying to listen to the safe with a stethoscope, implying that she doesn't know the combination. ThisSafe-cracking is often associated with criminals, and thus the joke is making a play on the fact that the person who would be best equipped to help her is unavailable because he's behind bars.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is trying to diagnose a safe, which of course, doesn't have a heartbeat. The only way to "treat" a safe is to crack it open, which is illegal. The joke is clever because it uses the word "specialist" in two ways: first, a specialist is a doctor who is an expert in a particular field, but second, a safe-cracker is also a specialist in a particular field (cracking open safes).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor implies that she knows how to crack the safe, but she would need to consult with a specialist to do it. However, the only specialist she knows is in prison, which means that she can't get the help she needs. The humor here comes from the contrast between the professional setting and the criminal activity.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is trying to figure out how to open the safe, and the only person she knows who could help her is a specialist in opening safes... but he's in prison. The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that people in prison are usually there because they are experts in illegal activities.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is saying that she knows a specialist who could help with the safe, but he's in prison. The joke plays on the idea that people who are experts in a particular field are often seen as shady or criminal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is trying to listen to the safe, presumably to figure out the combination, and she comments that she knows a specialist who could help her. However, the specialist is in prison, which means he's probably there for trying to rob a safe --- meaning he's not exactly someone the doctor should be seeking help from.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is trying to listen to the safe to figure out the combination, and the person she's talking to says that he knows a specialist, but he's in prison. This is a play on words because the specialist the man is talking about is a safe-cracker, but the fact that he's in prison means that he's not going to be much help.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is trying to figure out how to crack the safe, and the person she's talking to says that he knows a specialist, but he's in prison. This is a play on the fact that often, people who know how to crack safes are criminals. The irony is that the person who could help the doctor is in prison, so she can't get help from him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the safe is obviously not a human, but the doctor is treating it as if it is. The joke suggests that the only person who would be able to help the safe (by cracking it open) is a specialist, but that specialist is in prison. This is funny because it is a very specific problem that most people wouldn't be able to help with.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while a doctor might be able to refer a patient to a specialist for a more difficult case, usually, the specialist is not in prison. The contrast between the expected answer and the reality of the situation is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is trying to help the patient (the safe) by suggesting that she knows a specialist (a safe-cracker) who can help, but the specialist is in prison. The joke is clever because it uses the double-meaning of the word "specialist": in the context of a doctor's office, a specialist is a medical doctor who has expertise in a specific area of medicine, but in the context of a safe, a specialist is a person who has expertise in opening safes.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non-sequitur. The doctor is trying to figure out how to crack the safe, and the patient (presumably the owner of the safe) says that he knows a specialist, but he's in prison. The joke is funny because it is unexpected and doesn't help the doctor solve the problem.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in order to open a safe, you usually need a specialist, i.e., someone who knows the combination. However, the fact that the doctor knows a specialist who is in prison implies that the specialist is a criminal. This is humorous because it's an unexpected twist on a normal situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor has to resort to breaking into the safe in order to get the information that she needs. The irony is that there is a specialist who could help her, but he's in prison.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="64.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="66.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
