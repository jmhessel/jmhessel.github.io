Here, the ducks are sitting in the seats, with laptops open in front of them, presumably typing away. The joke is that, even though they are typing randomly, they will never produce anything as good as Shakespeare, because they are ducks, not monkeys.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "wring your own neck" is a common idiom meaning to make things more difficult than they need to be. However, in this context, the word "wring" is literal: the speaker is suggesting that the other person strangle themselves with their own hands. The joke is also a play on the "infinite monkey theorem", which posits that a monkey hitting keys at random on a keyboard for an infinite amount of time will eventually produce the complete works of Shakespeare. In this case, the ducks are typing on laptops, but the result is still gibberish.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the "infinite monkey theorem." The theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a keyboard for an infinite amount of time will eventually type out the entire works of William Shakespeare. In this case, the ducks are the monkeys, and they are typing away on the keyboard. The scientists looking at them are presumably wondering if the ducks will ever type anything coherent. The joke is that, even if the ducks type for an infinite amount of time, they will never type anything as coherent as the works of Shakespeare.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double-meaning of "wring": in a normal scenario, to "wring" someone's neck means to kill them by twisting their neck. However, the fact that the ducks are in the place of humans re-contextualizes the word "wring": in this context, "to wring" someone's neck would be to tighten their laptop so that it's uncomfortable to use.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "wring your own neck" is a idiom meaning to be very stressed out, and it's often used when someone is exasperated. In this case, the person is actually talking about wringing the neck of a duck, which is a common method of killing them. The fact that the ducks are on laptops is just a coincidence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "wring your neck" is often used to mean "to kill someone". However, in this context, the person is askign if you ever get frustrated and want to kill yourself, which is a completely different meaning. The fact that the person is asking if you want to kill yourself in front of a classroom full of birds also makes the joke funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "wring your own neck" is often used to mean "to be very stressed out." In this case, the person is asking if the person ever wants to literally wring their own neck, i.e., kill themselves. The fact that the person is a bird makes the joke funnier because it's unusual for a bird to be contemplating suicide.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "To wring someone's neck" means to kill them by breaking their neck. However, in this context, the person is asking if you ever get annoyed with yourself to the point where you want to "wring your own neck", or, kill yourself. The joke is made even funnier by the fact that the person asking the question is a bird --- which are not known for their intelligence.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "to have a duck in the class," which means to have someone who is not paying attention or participating. In this case, the "ducks" are actually ducks, so they literally don't give a quack about the class. The joke is also a play on the "infinite monkey theorem," which posits that a monkey typing randomly on a keyboard will eventually produce a work of Shakespeare; in this case, the ducks typing randomly on their laptops will never produce anything of value.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "wring your own neck" is often used to mean "to be very angry with oneself." However, in this context, the person is literally asking if the other person ever wants to kill themselves, which is a much more serious topic. The contrast between the two meanings is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the double meaning of "wring": in a normal scenario, one might "wring their hands" in frustration, i.e., express their frustration without actually doing anything. However, in this context, the fact that the ducks have laptops open in front of them re-contextualizes the word "wring": in this context, to "wring their necks" would be to actually kill them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "to have a duck fit," which means to be angry. In this case, the person is talking about actual ducks, which makes it funny because it's a non-sequitur. Additionally, the ducks are on laptops, which makes it even more humorous because it's unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two people in lab coats are talking about how frustrating it is to deal with birds. This is a play on the phrase "to wring someone's neck," which means to strangle them. In this case, the person is talking about how they want to strangle their own neck, because they are so frustrated. The fact that the birds are all in a classroom setting, and are seemingly paying attention to their laptops, makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because ducks are often associated with being silly and not very smart. The laptop in front of them suggests they are researching or taking notes, but the fact that they are ducks implies that they aren't getting very far. The man's statement is funny because it's a play on the phrase "to wring one's hands," which means to worry or be anxious. The phrase "to wring one's own neck" would mean to kill oneself, which is a more extreme reaction than simply worrying.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "wring your own neck" usually means to be so angry with someone that you want to strangle them. In this case, the person is asking if you ever get so angry with yourself that you want to wringe your own neck, but the word "wring" also happens to be a homophone for the word "write." So, the person is really asking if you ever get so angry with yourself that you want to write your own neck, which is a strange thing to say.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="64.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="66.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
