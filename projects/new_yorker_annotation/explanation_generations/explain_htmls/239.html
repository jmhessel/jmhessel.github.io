In this case, the clone is made of bubbles, which are not very stable, and thus the joke is that the clone won't last long.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the nonchalant way the men discuss the man turning into a bubble. This suggests that, to them, it is a regular occurrence and not something to be alarmed about. The fact that the man is turning into a bubble is unusual, and the joke pokes fun at the way people can become complacent with even the most bizarre things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two men are talking about the bubble man as if he is a clone who is going to "expire" or die soon. This is a play on the fact that clones are often seen as expendable and not as real people.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="238.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="240.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
