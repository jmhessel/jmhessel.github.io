It's also funny because the husband is calmly making a joke about the situation, as if it's totally normal, when it's clearly not.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because usually when a weatherperson says there is a certain percentage chance of precipitation, they are referring to water (like rain or snow). However, in this case, the precipitation is much more literal and dangerous, and it's comical to think of anvils as "precipitation."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common meteorological expression "twenty percent chance of rain." In this case, instead of the more usual form of precipitation, there is a twenty percent chance of safes, which are much larger and more dangerous, raining down.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man is saying that, based on the current bizarre weather conditions, there is a high likelihood that tomorrow it will rain anvils, which are even more dangerous than safes. This is humorous because it is highly unlikely that it will actually rain anvils.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it states a forecast for the type of rain that is happening as if it is a normal thing. This is absurd because, of course, it is not normal for it to rain safes, and so the joke exaggerates the strange nature of the event by pointing out that the forecast for the next day includes an even stranger event: rain made up of anvils.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the weatherman's cliche forecast of "a chance of showers". In this case, instead of rain, there is a chance of anvils falling from the sky. This is dangerous because anvils are heavy objects that can cause serious injury if they hit someone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the standard weather report forecast of precipitation. In this case, instead of rain, the couple is dealing with safes falling from the sky, which is much more dangerous. The joke is also funny because it's a rare instance where the forecast is actually more dire than people might think.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of safes falling from the sky like rain. It's even more incongruous because the man says that, tomorrow, there is a chance of even more bizarre and impossible things, like anvils, falling from the sky. This is silly because anvils are much heavier than safes and would, therefore, be far less likely to fall from the sky.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is unlikely that it would rain safes, and even less likely that tomorrow there would be a twenty percent chance of anvils. This is a made up scenario, which makes the joke funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because weather forecasts often include information about precipitation, in the form of rain or snow. However, the items raining down from the sky in this scene are not precipitation, they are objects which could potentially injure people. The fact that the speaker says there is a twenty percent chance of more anvils tomorrow is absurd, since anvils are not normally found in the sky.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is surprised by the safes falling from the sky, and the woman is making a joke about the weatherman's predictions being wrong. The joke is even funnier because the woman's prediction of anvils is even more implausible than the safes.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the forecast is for more safes to fall from the sky, which is absurd. It's also funny because "anvils" are often used in cartoons as a heavy object that falls from the sky and crushes someone. The joke is a play on the fact that anvils are also often used in safes to weigh them down and make them harder to steal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity between the two objects: safes and anvils. It's unexpected that safes would rain from the sky, and even more unexpected that anvils would be next. The joke makes light of the situation by suggesting that the anvils are not as dangerous as the safes.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, just like how anvils rarely fall from the sky in cartoons, the idea of safes raining from the sky is improbable and unexpected. The joke is made even funnier by the matter-of-fact tone in which the speaker states it, as if it's a perfectly normal thing to happen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because anvils, like safes, are heavy objects that can cause damage if they fall on someone. The joke is a play on the fact that weather forecasts often give percentages for chance of precipitation, with the punchline being that instead of rain, there is a chance of objects that are much more dangerous.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="238.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="240.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
