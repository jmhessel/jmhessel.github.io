He won't last long.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snowman, who is made of snow, will naturally melt in the store, which is warm. The joke makes a clever analogy between the snowman and the two women: just as the snowman will not last long in the store, the women will not last long in the clothes they are trying on and will have to buy them eventually.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snowman is in a department store, which is an unusual place for a snowman. Furthermore, the implication is that the snowman is working as a security guard, but since he's made of snow, he won't last long in the warm store. This is a play on the fact that retail jobs often have high turnover rates.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is very unlikely for a snowman to last long in a store, since it would probably melt quickly. The fact that the snowman is watching the two women is also funny, since it is a common belief that snowmen come to life and have personalities.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snowman is in a department store, which is an indoor, man-made environment. Snowmen melt in warm environments, so it's likely that this snowman won't last long. The joke is also funny because the snowman is watching the women as they shop, which is a bit creepy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snowman is in a department store, which is an indoors place. Snowmen belong in the outdoors, so it's strange to see one in the store. Furthermore, the fact that the snowman is watching the women suggests that he is interested in them, which is a bit creepy. The joke is funny because it suggests that the snowman is not going to last long in the store because he doesn't belong there.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snowman is in a store, and it's not winter. Therefore, the snowman is melting and won't last long. This comment is reassuring to the women, who might be worried about the snowman coming to life and attacking them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is summertime and the snowman is melting. The joke is also funny because it is a common saying that men are "bad in bed" if they don't last long. In this case, the snowman is not "bad in bed" but he is bad at being a snowman because he is melting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snowman is in a store, which is an enclosed space without any snow. In addition, the snowman is wearing a hat, which means he's not likely to melt quickly. The joke implies that the store employees expect the snowman to melt soon, which is why they put him in the store in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snowman is in a department store, which is an indoor environment. Snowmen usually melt in indoor environments, so the joke is that the snowman is not long for this world.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the women are talking about the snowman as if it is a living being, when in fact, it is not. The snowman is just a statue made of snow, and it will melt soon. This is a play on the fact that people sometimes treat inanimate objects as if they are alive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snowman is in a department store, which is an unusual place for him. Furthermore, the snowman is watching the women, which is a bit creepy. The joke is that the snowman won't last long because he'll melt in the store (which is warm).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snowman is in a snow globe, a type of decoration that is often given as a gift during the winter holiday season. The snowman is in a glass globe filled with water, and he is melting. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the snowman won't last long because he is melting, but he also won't last long because he is a decoration that will eventually be taken down and stored away.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snowman is a metaphor for the seasonal worker who will only be at the store for a short period of time. The implication is that the women shouldn't worry about the snowman because he'll be gone soon enough. Seasonal workers are often looked down upon because they are seen as being less committed or skilled than permanent employees.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the snowman is a seasonal worker who won't have a job much longer. The fact that he's already starting to melt (i.e., he won't last long) is just a testament to how short his employment will be.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is unexpected. Most people would not expect a snowman to be working in a department store, especially one that is made of snow. The joke is also a play on the fact that snowmen melt in warm weather, so the snowman won't last long in the store.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="238.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="240.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
