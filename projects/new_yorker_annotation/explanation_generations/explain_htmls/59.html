The first meaning of "office" is a room where someone works, but it can also mean a person's position in an organization, i.e., their "job." In this case, the man with the snake is trying to avoid going to his boss's office, or being fired from his job. The second meaning of "office" is also a play on the word "off," as in, "to be away from work." So, the man with the snake is trying to avoid going to work, or taking a day off.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the men carrying the snake says that they should put it anywhere but in Eve's office. This is a play on the phrase "apple of my eye," which means a person or thing that one cherishes above all others. In this case, the man cherished his office more than he did Eve, so he didn't want the snake in there.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the paper is holding an invoice, which is a bill for services rendered. In this case, the service being rendered is the removal of a snake from the office. The joke is that the man with the invoice is trying to avoid going to Eve's office, which is presumably where the snake was found. The joke is clever because it is a play on the word "snake," which can refer to both a literal snake and to a person who is sneaky or untrustworthy.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="58.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="60.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
