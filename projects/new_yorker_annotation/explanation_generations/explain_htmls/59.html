The word "polls" can refer to public opinion surveys, as well as the act of paddling a boat. In this case, the polls (public opinion surveys) show that the boat will miss the wave, but the people in the boat are still paddling as hard as they can, indicating that they are not confident in the surveys.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the gigantic face on the wave is the Statue of Liberty, which is meant to be a beacon of hope for immigrants coming to America. However, in this case, the immigrants are trying to flee America, and the polls (presumably referring to public opinion polls) show that they will successfully escape. The joke is clever because it uses the Statue of Liberty, which is supposed to represent America as a whole, to instead represent Americans' negative opinions of immigrants.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person on the boat is worried about the giant face on the wave, which is a symbol of the United States, crashing down on them. However, the person is reassured that the giant face will miss them, based on polls. This is a play on the fact that, often, news stories about natural disasters or other events will include a poll about how people feel about the event. In this case, the poll is about whether or not the giant face will hit the boat, with the person on the boat being reassured that it won't.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "the coast is clear". In this case, the "coast" is the edge of the boat, and the people are safe from the wave because the polls (which are usually reliable) show that the wave will miss the boat. The joke is clever because it uses the same word, "coast", to mean two different things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the boat is rowing frantically to try and escape the huge wave, but he's reassured by the other man that they don't have to worry because the polls say that the wave will miss them. The joke is a play on the fact that often people will say "don't worry, the polls show that we're safe" in reference to election results, as if the results of a popularity contest could save them from a natural disaster.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "polls" being referenced are not the kind that show how people are voting, but rather, the kind that are used in rowing --- specifically, the oars. The fact that the people aren't worried about the wave because they think it will miss them is ironic because the wave is about to swamp the boat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "polls" in this case refer to public opinion polls, like the ones that are used to predict the outcomes of elections. However, in this situation, the "polls" are actually the waves that are used to predict the tides. Thus, the joke is that the people are mistakenly thinking that the public opinion polls about a potential dangerous situation are actually waves that will miss them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The first meaning is that the people in the boat are not worried about the dangerous looking wave because they think it will miss the boat. The second meaning is that the people in the boat are immigrants, and the "wave" is a metaphor for the current political situation in the United States, which has been increasingly hostile to immigrants. The joke is clever because it can be interpreted in two different ways.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the people in the boat are immigrants, and they are being (literally) overwhelmed by a gigantic wave in the form of a face. The joke is a play on the phrase "being overwhelmed by a wave of immigrants/asylum seekers", which is often used by people who are against immigration. In this case, the immigrants are literally being overwhelmed by a wave, but they are not afraid because they know the polls show that it will miss them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person paddling the boat is calm and collected, despite the fact that they are about to be hit by a giant wave. The person is confident that they will escape the wave because of the polls, which presumably show that the wave will miss the boat. However, the waves are created by the wind, which is an act of nature, not something that can be predicted by polls.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "polls" mentioned could refer to public opinion polls, which are often used to gauge voters' reactions to current events and predict the outcomes of elections. In this case, the "polls" are the waves, and the giant face on the wave is interpreted as a referendum on immigration. Those who are against immigration may see the giant face as a sign that their side is winning, while those who are for immigration may see it as a sign that their side is losing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the Statue of Liberty, which is located in New York City. The joke is implying that the people on the boat are immigrants coming to the United States, and that they are worried about the gigantic face on the wave, which represents the Statue of Liberty. However, the man says not to worry, because the polls show that the wave will miss them, meaning that they will successfully make it to the United States.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the double meaning of the word "polls." In this context, a "poll" is a body of water, specifically the sea. However, the other meaning of "poll" is a survey that is used to gauge public opinion on a particular issue. In this case, the people in the boat are being told not to worry because the "polls" (surveys) show that the wave will not hit them. This is a relief to them, since the wave looks dangerous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The people in the boat are worried about the wave, which may or may not be a natural disaster. However, the person who is comforting them is talking about the "polls", which in this case, refer to the polls of the presidential election. The joke is that the person is more worried about the outcome of the election than the possibility of them dying.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it references the recent trend of people moving to coastal cities because they believe that global warming will cause the sea levels to rise and flood inland cities. In this case, the joke is that the people in the boat are not worried about the giant wave because they think it will miss them, based on polls. The joke is clever because it is a play on the fact that people often trust polls even when they are not accurate, as well as the fact that global warming is a contentious issue.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="58.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="60.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
