Given the situation, one would expect the prisoner, who is about to be executed, to be scared or stoic. Instead, the prisoner makes a joke that recruitment is down. This is funny because it is a non-sequitur: the fact that the firing squad is diverse has nothing to do with how many people they are able to recruit. Thus, the joke is funny because it is unexpected and doesn't make sense in the context.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the firing squad is so diverse that it's implied that they had a hard time finding people who were willing to kill the prisoner. The captain is surprised that the prisoner noticed this, and seems to be trying to downplay the issue. The prisoner is not convinced, and points out that even a dog is in the squad, which suggests that they were desperate enough to allow animals to join.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the prisoner, who is about to be executed, is making a light-hearted observation about the firing squad's diversity. It's also funny because it's a play on words: the firing squad is usually recruited from the military, but in this case, the prisoner is suggesting that the firing squad is so diverse because they are having trouble meeting their quotas for military recruitment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non-sequitur. The firing squad is about to execute the prisoner, so the prisoner's comment about their recruitment quota doesn't make any sense in that context. However, the comment is actually a veiled insult: by suggesting that the firing squad is composed of people who couldn't make it into the military, the prisoner is suggesting that they are a bunch of incompetent losers. The fact that the insult is cleverly disguised makes it even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the firing squad is made up of very diverse group of people, suggesting that the person being executed must have done a lot of harm to anger such a wide swath of people. The joke implies that the military is having trouble finding able-bodied people to fill its ranks, so it's having to rely on grandmothers, kids, and dogs to do the job.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the scene looks like a standard execution by firing squad, but with an atypical, diverse group of people. The person about to be executed points out that it must be difficult to find enough people willing to kill him, given how diverse the group is. This is a play on the fact that firing squads are typically made up of military personnel.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a non-sequitur in the context of an execution. It's also a bit of a dark joke, as it implies that the prisoner is going to be executed regardless of whether or not the firing squad can find enough people to shoot him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the firing squad is so diverse that it's implied that they had difficulty finding enough people who wanted to shoot the prisoner. The person in the captain's outfit is trying to lighten the mood by making a joke, but the people in the firing squad don't seem to think it's funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of a firing squad being worried about quotas. It's even more ironic because, in most cases, firing squads are made up of people who were already in the military, so they would already be familiar with the concept of quotas. In this context, though, the firing squad is made up of people from all walks of life, suggesting that they were recruited specifically for this purpose, which is why they are worried about meeting a quota.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the prisoner is making a pun on the word "recruitment", which has a double meaning. In this case, the firing squad is made up of people who have been "recruited" to kill the prisoner, but the prisoner is also suggesting that the firing squad is so diverse because they are having trouble recruiting people to join their ranks.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the execution is happening in public, so the firing squad is technically being recruiting people to join. The prisoner is being executed because they have enemies, so the firing squad is made up of those enemies. The fact that the firing squad is so diverse implies that the prisoner has wronged a lot of different types of people, which is why they have so many enemies.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the firing squad is so diverse that it's hard to imagine that they would all be volunteers. It's more likely that they were chosen by a draft, or that they are conscripts who were pressured into signing up. The prisoner's comment implies that the military is having a hard time finding enough people to execute him, which is a dark joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The firing squad is diverse, suggesting that the prisoner has made a lot of enemies, but the joke implies that the firing squad is having difficulty attracting people to join their ranks. So, the prisoner is jokingly saying that the firing squad is having difficulty "meeting their recruitment quota".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The prisoner is facing a firing squad, which is often used as a method of execution, and they comment on the diverse nature of the crowd that has gathered to watch. However, the prisoner misinterprets the squad as being a "firing squad" (a military unit responsible for carrying out executions), and remarks on their trouble with recruitment. The firing squad, being composed of an unlikely group of people, is not likely to be effective in carrying out their executions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it suggests that the firing squad is so diverse because they are having trouble meeting their recruitment quota. The joke plays on the idea that a firing squad is typically composed of soldiers, who are often recruited through quotas, i.e., a certain number of soldiers that need to be recruited from a population. However, in this case, the firing squad is composed of random people from all walks of life, suggesting that they are not professional soldiers but rather amateurs who are looking to get their revenge on the prisoner.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="58.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="60.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
