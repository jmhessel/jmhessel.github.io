However, the pigeon is not impressed because rats are commonly associated with uncleanliness and disease, so going sewer rafting would be a step down for her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unexpected for a rat to be flying with artificial wings and it's also unexpected for a rat to want to fly in the first place. The rat's comment about going sewer rafting is a play on the common expressions "sky's the limit" and "going to new heights". Sewer rafting is an activity that is dirty and dangerous, which is a fitting activity for a rat, given their common connotations as being dirty and disease-ridden.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The rat is asking the pigeon to go on a date with him, but he says it in a way that sounds like he's saying "sewer rafting." It's also funny because it's unlikely that a rat would actually date a pigeon, given their natural predator-prey relationship.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The rat is asking the pigeon out on a date, but because he is a rat, he lives in the sewers. He therefore suggests an activity that is related to his home: sewer rafting, which is presumably rafting through the sewage in the sewers. The pigeon is unlikely to want to do this activity, and the joke is therefore funny because it's a ridiculous suggestion.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Sewer" and "sewer rafting" sound similar, but have very different meanings. The joke is also funny because it's a pretty creative way to ask someone on a date.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "sewer" can refer to a place where rats live, and it can also be pronounced like the word "sorrow." So, the rat is saying that the pigeon can come and visit him in his home (the sewer), or the rat can come and visit the pigeon in its home (a sorrowful place).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the rat has managed to fly, it's still a rat, and rats are generally considered to be dirty animals. So, thefact that the rat wants the pigeon to go on a date rafting in a sewer is humorous because it's a dirty activity that is fitting for a rat.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reverse play on the common "bird in the hand" idiom. Instead of having a valuable rat, the person has a worthless rat with poorly made wings. In order to try and make it seem valuable, they offer to take the rat on a date to the sewer, which is where rats usually live. This is funny because it's a dirty and unpleasant place, which is the opposite of what you want on a date.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the pigeon is asking the rat to go on a date with her, and the rat is trying to come up with an excuse as to why he can't go. He says that he can't go because he has to go sewer rafting, which is a made up activity. This is a play on the common excuse that people use when they don't want to go on a date, which is that they are "busy."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The rat is asking the pigeon on a date, but instead of going to a romantic restaurant or something, he wants to go sewer rafting. This is a play on the phrase "seaplane", which is a type of aircraft that can land on water. But in this case, the rat is asking the pigeon to go rafting in a sewer, which is decidedly not romantic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The rat wants to "sow its wild oats" which is an idiom meaning to have sexual intercourse with multiple partners, but "oats" is also a type of grain that rats like to eat. So, the rat is asking the pigeon out on a date to go sewer rafting, which is an activity that rats enjoy, but which the pigeon probably finds disgusting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implying that the rat would rather go on a date in the sewer than on the roof with the pigeon. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the saying "sow your wild oats."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The rat is asking the pigeon to go on a date with him, and the pigeon agrees, but says that for their second date, the rat has to go sewer rafting. The word "sewer" is a homonym for "soar", so the pigeon is saying that the rat has to go flying in the sewer instead of on a roof with fake wings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "sewer" can mean both a type of roof and a type of large pipe that carries waste water. The rat is ask the pigeon to go on a date with him to the sewer, which is actually just a roof, but the pigeon thinks he's asking her to go into the pipe.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully alludes to the idea that pigeons and rats are dirty creatures often associated with unclean environments like sewers. The rat, in contrast, is trying to clean up his image by strapping wings to himself to look like a pigeon. The suggestion of going "sewer rafting" on a second date is a way of saying that the rat is still not good enough for the pigeon, even though he's trying to improve himself.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="96.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="98.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
