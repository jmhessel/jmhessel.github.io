The jester is telling the king that his "overhead" --- the costs of maintaining his lavish lifestyle --- is going to be his downfall. In other words, the king is going to be "chopped down" by his own extravagance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "overhead" can refer to the cost of running a business, which the king is effectively doing by sitting on his throne and listening to the court reader. However, the word "overhead" can also refer to the giant sword hanging above the king, which could easily kill him if it fell on him. The joke pokes fun at the fact that the king is in a potentially dangerous situation because of the sword, and also because he is not paying attention to the court reader and is not running his kingdom effectively.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the giant knife is a metaphor for the king's "overhead" expenses; in other words, the king is spending too much money. The jester is telling him this in a roundabout way, by saying that the giant knife will eventually fall and kill him, meaning that his expenses will eventually bankrupt him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "overhead" can refer to both the giant knife hanging above the king's throne (i.e., the physical overhead) and the operating costs of the king's kingdom (i.e., the financial overhead). In either case, the joke is that the overhead is going to be the king's downfall.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the jester is basically telling the king that the giant knife hanging above his head is going to fall and kill him. It's a play on words because "overhead" can refer both to the physical location of the knife (i.e., it's above his head) and also to the fact that it's a business expense (i.e., it's an overhead cost).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Overhead" can refer to the cost of running a business, which the king in this case is clearly struggling with, given the precarious position of the sword hanging over his head. However, in this case, "overhead" also literally refers to the sword hanging over the king's head, which could kill him at any moment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a pun on the idiom "to kill two birds with one stone." In this case, instead of birds, the king himself is at risk of being killed by the large knife hanging over his head. The jester is cleverly warning the king that the knife is a dangerous liability, and he needs to get rid of it before it causes any harm.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "your overhead is going to kill you" is a business idiom meaning that a company is spending too much money on overhead costs and will go bankrupt as a result. However, in this case, the "overhead" is literal, i.e., the huge sword hanging over the king, which could fall on him at any moment and kill him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "your head is going to roll," which is a threat often made by kings to their subordinates. In this case, the subordinate is the jester, and the king is literally going to be decapitated by the giant knife hanging overhead if he doesn't watch out.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Overhead" can refer to the actual physical overhead of the sword, which could kill the king if it fell on him, but it can also refer to the expense of maintaining a court, which the king is also responsible for. In either case, the joke is that the king is in danger of being killed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The "overhead" in this case is the giant knife that is hanging above the king's throne, which could drop down and kill him at any moment. However, the jester is also talking about the king's "overhead" in the sense of his business expenses, which are also too high and could lead to his ruin.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the huge sword hanging above the king is a metaphor for his "overhead" --- i.e., the expenses associated with running a kingdom. In this case, the overhead is literally going to kill him because the sword could fall on him at any moment.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Your overhead" could refer to the giant knife hanging over the king's throne, which could fall and kill him at any moment. However, "your overhead" could also refer to the king's expenses, which are high due to the expensive giant knife hanging over his throne. In either case, the joke is funny because it's a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in business, "overhead" refers to the fixed costs of running a business, like rent, that are not directly related to producing a product or service. In this case, the overhead is a giant knife hanging over the king's throne, which is a very literal and dangerous overhead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the huge sword hanging over the king's head could literally kill him if it fell down. In business, "overhead" refers to the costs of running a business that are not directly related to products or services, e.g., rent, utilities, etc. Thus, the joke is cleverly punning on the two definitions of "overhead."</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
