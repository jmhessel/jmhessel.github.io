This is a contrast between the two environments, which makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the chef is in jail and is still trying to flambé food. Flambé is a French cooking technique where alcohol is added to a hot pan to create a flame. The joke is funny because the chef is in jail and is still trying to do something associated with his former profession, even though it is now illegal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is upset because the chef is not cooking the food the way she wants it. In particular, she wants him to stop making the food too spicy. The chef is telling her that if she keeps complaining, he will make the food so spicy that it will be classified as a felony.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is asking the chef to make a dish that is illegal in the jail, and the chef is telling her that it's against the law. The irony is that the woman is in jail for a crime, so she should already know that what she's asking for is illegal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is sad because she is in jail, and the chef is sad because he is not able to cook for her. The joke is that the chef is trying to make a joke about the fact that he can't cook for her by saying that the food he would make would be so hot it would be felony arson. However, the fact that she is in jail means that the word "felony" has a very different meaning for her, which is not lost on the chef.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because flambé is a type of cooking where alcohol is set on fire and then the food is cooked in the flames. Arson is the crime of setting fire to property, so the chef is joking that if he did that in jail it would be considered a felony.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the chef is in jail, and therefore he is not allowed to cook. The joke is a play on words because "flambé" is a type of cooking where food is set on fire, and "felony arson" is a crime where someone sets fire to something.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman Chef is talking to is in prison, and she is telling him how to cook a dish. The dish is called "flambé," but because she is in prison, the Chef interpreting her instructions as instructions for committing a felony.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is talking to the chef about how he can make a meal, and the chef says that he can make it "flambé," a type of meal where the food is set on fire. However, the woman says that in jail, that would be called felony arson, which is a crime. The joke is clever because it is both a play on words and a true statement.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman on the phone is talking to a chef who is flambéing a dish, and she is referencing the fact that setting fires is a felony. The woman is in prison, so she is likely to have been convicted of a felony, making the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the chef is trying to make a phone call to his girlfriend, but he gets interrupted by the inmate. The inmate starts talking about how the chef is going to get in trouble for setting fire to the food, which is a felony. The chef is trying to tell the inmate that he was just trying to make a phone call, but the inmate doesn't understand.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The chef is in jail and the woman is on the other side of the phone talking to him. The chef is still in his chef clothes and the woman is telling him that what he did (arson) is a felony. She is also telling him that he can keep calling the dish he made "flambé" but out here it is felony arson.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman on the phone is talking to a chef, who is making a dish called "flambé." In the prison, the word "flambé" is being used as a euphemism for "arson." The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the literal meaning of "flambé" is to set something on fire, which is what the chef is doing to the dish; but the figurative meaning of "flambé" is to set something on fire, which is what the woman on the phone is accused of doing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman on the phone is talking to a man who is a chef, and she is telling him that he can keep calling the food he is cooking "flambé," but in the prison (where she is currently residing), it is considered a felony.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is a chef, and she is speaking to the chef on the phone, telling him how to make a dish. The dish is called "flambé," which is a French word meaning "flamed." In this context, the word "flambé" is a verb meaning to set fire to something. The joke is that in prison, setting fire to something is a felony, so the woman is telling the chef that he can call the dish "flambé," but out here in prison, it's just felony arson.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="27.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="29.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
