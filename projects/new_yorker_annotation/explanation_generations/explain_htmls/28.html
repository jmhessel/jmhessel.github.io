The fact that the toast is wearing a bowtie suggests that it is a formal occasion, and the man is saying that he's fully booked, but he can "sandwich" the toast in. This is a pun because a "sandwich" is a type of food, but it's also a verb meaning to squish something in between two other things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man taking reservations is trying to be helpful to the sad piece of toast by suggesting that he can "sandwich" him in, meaning he can fit him in between two other reservation times. However, the fact that the toast is actually a food item makes the man's statement unintentionally humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the word "sandwich": in this context, a sandwich is a type of food, but the word can also be used as a verb meaning to squish something in between two other things. In this case, the man is telling the toast that he can squish him in between two other reservations.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter is telling the toast that the restaurant is fully booked, but he can "sandwich" the toast in. The joke is a play on words because "sandwich" can mean both a type of food (which the toast is) and a verb meaning to squish something in between two other things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is trying to be accommodating to the giant piece of toast by offering to "sandwich" him in, meaning to fit him into the schedule somewhere. However, the man is also literally suggesting that he could make the giant piece of toast into a sandwich, which is clearly not what the toast wants.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man at the reservation booth is trying to accommodate the piece of toast even though it's not clear how the toast would be able to do anything once it's booked a reservation. The joke is also funny because of the literal meaning of the word "sandwich": to "sandwich" something in between two other things. In this case, the toast would be "sandwiched" in between two reservations.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is treating the piece of toast like a regular customer, even though it's just a piece of toast. The man is trying to be helpful by offering to "sandwich" the toast in, meaning to fit it in between two other reservations. This is a play-on-words because "sandwich" can also refer to a type of food (which is made with bread, like toast).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter is talking to a piece of toast, and says that he can "sandwich" the toast in-between other reservations. This is a play on words, because a "sandwich" is also a type of food.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man makes a pun off of the word "sandwich." In this context, a "sandwich" is both a type of food (usually consisting of bread and some type of filling), as well as a verb meaning to "squeeze in between two other things." In this case, the man is telling the sad toast that he can't have a reservation, but he can try to squeeze him in between other reservations.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the toast is trying to make a reservation at a restaurant, but the waiter mistake the toast for an order of food. The waiter then tells the toast that he is fully booked, but he can sandwich the toast in, meaning to put the toast in between two other orders of food.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the booth says that they are "fully booked" but he can "sandwich" the Toast in, meaning that he can fit the Toast in-between other reservations. This is silly because, of course, the Toast is food and can literally be sandwiched.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter is using a pun to tell the toast that there is no room for him at the restaurant. The fact that the toast is trying to make a reservation at a restaurant is humorous because toasts are usually eaten at restaurants, not the other way around.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the double-meaning of the word "sandwich." A sandwich is both a type of food (which toasts are often used as), and a term for when two things are crammed together. In this case, the joke is that the restaurant is "fully booked" (i.e. all the tables are taken), but the waiter can still try to "sandwich" the reservation in (i.e. fit it in somehow).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully suggests that the two customers, one human and one a piece of toast, are the same. The man is trying to be helpful by saying he can "sandwich" the toast in, but the joke is that the toast is already a sandwich.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the maître d'hôtel is telling the toast that the restaurant is full, but he can "sandwich" the toast in. This is a play on words because "sandwich" is both a type of food (that can be made with toast) and a verb meaning to put something in between two other things.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="27.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="29.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
