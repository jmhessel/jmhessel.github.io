The two men are staring at the woman because her ruff is so large, but they are also staring because she is wearing two different shoes. This implies that they are both confused and amused by her clothing choice.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it points out that the woman's outfit is so absurd and her collar is so huge that it's obscuring the fact that she's wearing two different shoes. In other words, the situation is so absurd that the men are only noticing details that would normally be considered very minor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the woman's collar is a fashion faux pas, it's not as noticeable as the fact that she is wearing two different shoes. The two men are trying to decide whether to point out the more obvious or the less obvious fashion mistake.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "the elephant in the room." The phrase is used when there is an obvious problem or issue that everyone is aware of, but no one wants to talk about. In this case, the issue is that the woman is wearing two different shoes. The joke is clever because it points out the problem while also making a reference to the size of the woman's collar.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common advice to "look for the silver lining" in every situation. In this case, the silver lining is that the woman's shoes match, even though her collar is mismatched. The joke is also funny because it's a pointed observation about how the woman's collar is so ridiculously large that it's obscuring her shoes.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The two men are staring at the woman because they think her frill is so large and strange-looking. However, the joke is that the men are actually staring at her because she's wearing two different shoes, which is a much more minor fashion faux pas. The difference in the two situations is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is based on the concept of a "fashion victim": a person who is unaware of or confident enough to care about the current trends in fashion. The woman in the scene is a prime example of a fashion victim, as she is wearing a Ruff, a type of collar that was popular in the 16th century, but is now considered outdated. Furthermore, she is wearing two different shoes, which is a major fashion faux pas. The joke is funnier because, in addition to being a fashion victim, the woman is also unaware of the most basic level of fashion: that one should match their shoes.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it draws attention to another fashion faux pas that the woman is committing: she is wearing two different shoes. This is significant because, during the Victorian Era, representing oneself as having good taste and being well-kempt was of utmost importance. Wearing two different shoes would be a major social gaffe.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is wearing a "ruff" around her neck, which is a type of collar that was popular in the Victorian Era. However, the word "ruff" can also mean "disheveled" or "unkempt", which is what the woman's appearance is due to her mismatched shoes. The joke is humorous because it's a subtle way to point out the woman's contradiction: she is trying to look prim and proper with her ruff, but her mismatched shoes make her look like she doesn't care about her appearance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because one of the men is drawing attention to the woman's fashion faux pas in a very subtle way. By saying that they should tell her she's wearing two different shoes, he's implying that her overall outfit is mismatched and not putting her best foot forward, so to speak. The joke is doubly funny because it's a very old-fashioned way of making a joke about someone's appearance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the "elephant in the room," meaning the big obvious thing that no one wants to talk about. In this case, the big obvious thing is that the woman is wearing two different shoes, which is a fashion faux pas. However, because her collar is so huge, it's easier to spot the shoes than it would be if her neck was uncovered. The men in the scene are debating whether or not to point out the fashion mistake to the woman, and the joke is that they are more concerned about her shoes than her extremely large collar.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it points out the absurdity of the woman's outfit. In addition to the large ruff around her neck, she is also wearing two different shoes, which is a fashion faux pas. The fact that the two men are more focused on the ruff than the shoes suggests that they find the ruff more unusual, and thus, funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The two men are staring at the woman because they think her collar is so huge that it's half her face. However, they could also be staring because they notice that she's wearing two different shoes. The joke is funny because it's a clever way to point out that the woman's collar is so big that it's covering half her face.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it compares the woman's large circular ruff to a small detail like wearing two different shoes. Because the ruff is so large, it's the only thing that stands out about her; the fact that she's wearing two different shoes is inconsequential in comparison. However, the joke suggests that the two men think the opposite: to them, the woman's shoes are more noticeable than her ruff.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a visual gag. The woman's neck ruffle is so large that it covers half of her face, making it look like she is wearing a mask. Furthermore, the collar is so wide that it makes it appear as if she is wearing two different shoes, one on each side. This is a humorous contrast to the typical image of a woman during the Victorian Era, who would be well-dressed and have everything in order.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="167.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="169.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
