It just means there will be no heir.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is worried that the cat being fat means that it won't be able to have kittens, and thus they will never have an heir to their "royal" status.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's concerned expression likely means that she's worried about the future of the monarchy, given that there is no heir apparent. The joke points out the absurdity of this situation: even though there's no heir, they'll still be royalty, because they're the king and queen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cat is so fat that it is unlikely to have any heirs (i.e., offspring that would take its place as king/queen after its death). The woman's concerned expression is likely due to the fact that, without an heir, her own status as royalty is in jeopardy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a monarchy, the heir is the person who will take over the throne when the current king or queen dies. But, in this case, because the king is a cat, there can't be an heir, because only humans can inherit the throne. Thus, the woman's husband is telling her not to worry, even though they won't have an heir, they'll still be royalty.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's unlikely that a cat would be fat enough to need two thrones, one for itself and one for its large stomach. Furthermore, it's even more unlikely that a cat would be a king or queen, because they are not human. In this case, the woman is concerned because, if the cat is the king or queen, and it dies, then there would be no heir to take its place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is concerned about the fact that the cat is fat, and the man tries to reassure her by saying that being fat doesn't mean that the cat won't still be royalty. The cat being royalty is a play on the fact that, often, obese people are called "fat cats." In this case, the fat cat is literally a fat cat, which makes the joke both clever and humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. When a monarchy "has an heir," it means that there is someone in line to take over the throne when the current monarch dies. However, in this case, the fat cat is so overweight that it is infertile, and thus there can never be an "heir" to the throne. This is a surprising and clever play on words that makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is worried about the fat cat because it is so overweight that it might not be able to have kittens, or have kittens that survive. However, the speaker reassures her by saying that even though the cat might not have any heirs, it will still be royalty. This is a humorous way of saying that the cat will still be their pet, and they will still love it even if it can't have kittens.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is worried about the fat cat, which is presumably her pet, becoming too obese to function properly. However, the joke reassures her that even though the cat may not be able to have kittens, it will still be considered royalty. This is a play on words because 'heir' can refer to both a successor to a throne and a child, so the joke is punning on the dual meaning of the word.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "heir" in this case is not a human heir, but rather the animal heir, i.e., the next cat in line for the throne. The fact that the cat is fat also plays into the joke, as it implies that the cat is lazy and/or doesn't have the energy to create more heirs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at the conceit that a fat cat would be a king. A king typically rules over a country, but a cat cannot rule over a country because it is not a human. The joke is also funny because it playfully mocks the woman's concern by suggesting that, even though the cat is not going to have any heirs, it will still be royalty.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is worried that the cat is too fat to have kittens, and therefore they won't have any heirs to their "royal" status. However, the word "heir" can also mean "one who inherits," so the man is saying that even though the cat can't have kittens, they can still inherit the throne.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in many monarchies, the heir to the throne is determined by bloodline. However, since the cat is fat, it is unlikely to have any heirs, since cats typically only have litters of two to five kittens. Therefore, the woman's concern is unwarranted: the cat may be fat, but it's still the king.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is concerned because the cat is fat, and the joke is that she is worried about the cat's health, specifically its ability to have kittens and continue the royal line. However, the fact that the cat is fat also means that it is unlikely to have kittens, and so there will be no heir to the throne. This joked is clever because it uses the same word, "heir", to mean both the cat's offspring and the successor to the throne.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is worried that the cat is going to die, and the man jokes that it doesn't matter, because they won't have an heir anyway. This is funny because "heir" can refer to both a descendant of royalty, and something that is inherited.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="82.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="84.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
