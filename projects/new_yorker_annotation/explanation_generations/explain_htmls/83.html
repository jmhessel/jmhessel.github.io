The alligator's meal came with a toy, but the toy is actually the alligator itself. This speaks to the absurdity of the fast food restaurant toy surprise, which is often not worth the cost of the meal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the alligators: they are shown in an impossible situation, having a conversation while standing on their hind legs and wearing baseball caps. This situation is made even more absurd by the fact that one of the alligators is wearing a propeller beanie, which is a type of children's toy. The alligators are in a situation that is so absurd, it is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common fast food advertising campaign whereby kids' meals come with a toy. In this case, the alligator on the left is asking the alligator on the right about the toy he got with his meal, suggesting that the alligator on the right is a child. The fact that the alligators are standing on their hind legs and wearing clothes is also humorous.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="82.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="84.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
