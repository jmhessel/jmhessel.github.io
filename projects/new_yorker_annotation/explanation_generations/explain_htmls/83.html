I feel like we're losing our focus.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The boss is telling the employees to stop playing around and to get back to work, but the word "wrap" can also mean to finish something up. So, the boss is telling the employees to finish up their game and go home for the day.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss's reaction ignores the ridiculousness of the situation and instead focuses on the fact that the employees are not working. This type of deadpan reaction is often used for comedic effect.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The boss is telling the employees to "wrap up," meaning to finish their work, but the employees are actually "wrapped up" in each other, meaning they are physically entangled. The boss is also telling them to "call it a day," meaning to end the work day, but in this context, "calling it a day" also means to end the physical activity the employees are engaged in.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The boss says "let's wrap up," meaning that he wants the employees to finish their work so they can leave for the day. However, "wrap up" can also mean to cover something with a material, usually for protection. In this case, the boss is saying that he wants the employees to stop what they are doing (riding the horse) and cover themselves up (with their clothes). This double-meaning makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss's reaction to the employees horsing around is to simply tell them to stop and get back to work. He doesn't seem particularly surprised or offended by their behavior, which would be more appropriate given the situation. The fact that he is more concerned with their loss of focus implies that this type of behavior is not uncommon in the office, which is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The boss is telling the employees to stop what they are doing because they are "losing their focus"; in other words, they are not paying attention to their work. However, the double meaning is that the employees are literally losing their focus, because they are riding each other like horses, which is a distraction from their work.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the employer's instruction to "wrap up and call it a day" is a double meaning. In a normal workplace setting, this would be a boss telling his employees to finish up their work and go home for the day. However, in this context, the boss is telling his employees to stop riding each other around like animals and to focus on their work.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss's reaction is completely understated given the bizarre situation he's witnessing. Instead of being horrified or even surprised, the boss is only mildly inconvenienced, and suggests that they end the work day early because he feels like they're losing focus. This is a polite way of saying that the situation is so ridiculous that it's impossible to focus on anything else.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is telling the twoEmployees to stop messing around and get back to work, but the way he phrases it, "let's wrap up and call it a day," implies that he wants them to stop what they're doing so that they can go home for the day. However, the fact that the two employees are riding each other like horses makes it clear that they are not going to be able to stop what they're doing and leave anytime soon.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is trying to downplay what is happening in the office and act like it is no big deal, when in reality, it is a very big deal. The joke is also funny because the boss's reaction is a common one to have when faced with an uncomfortable or unexpected situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss's reaction is a typical, dry reaction one might have if their employees were doing something inappropriate. However, the fact that the employees are riding each other like horses makes the joke even funnier, because it's a play on the phrase "being mount" which typically means to be in control or to be on top of a situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss's reaction to the situation is to try and end the work day early, implying that the two employees are wasting time by goofing off instead of working. However, the boss's use of the word "wrap up" is a double meaning, since the woman is actually wrapped around the man like a rodeo rider.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The boss is trying to get the employees to stop goofing off and get back to work, but the employees are so preoccupied with their horseplay that they don't even hear him. The boss is losing his focus because he's trying to get the employees to focus.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss's statement about losing focus is a play on words. In this context, "losing focus" could mean that the employees are not paying attention to their work, but it could also mean that the boss is losing his focus because he's distracted by the sight of the woman riding the man like a horse.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the boss is telling his employees to stop horsing around and get back to work. The word "focus" has a double-meaning in this context: first, it's a pun on the word "horse," as in the type of animal that the woman is riding. Second, it's a reference to the fact that the employees are not paying attention to their work and are instead goofing off.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
