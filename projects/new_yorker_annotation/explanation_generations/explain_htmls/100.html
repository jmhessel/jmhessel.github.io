The woman is sitting on top of the man in a sexual position, so when the man says "I love yard sales," it sounds like he's saying "I love sodomy." The joke is addressing the taboo subject of sexual fetishism in a light-hearted way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur: the woman says something that doesn't have anything to do with the situation, which is that she loves yard sales. The joke is funny because it's unexpected, and because it's a way of deflecting from the awkwardness of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the man married the woman knowing about her sexual fetish, and that he enjoys it because he can find props for her at yard sales. The joke is also funny because it's unexpected; most people would not expect someone to have a sexual fetish for pretending to be an insect.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while most people love finding good deals at yard sales, the man in this scene loves yard sales because he can find odd items, like a football helmet and bug ears, that cater to his wife's sexual fetish. The joke is funny because it's unexpected and because it's a clever way to discuss a taboo topic.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is sitting on top of the man in a sexual position, but she is wearing bug-ears, which makes it appear as if she is riding a horse. The joke is that the man must love yard sales, because that's where he found the horse-riding woman.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: "yard sale" can refer to a sale where people sell things from their yards, but it can also refer to a situation where someone is being "sold" (in this case, sexually) in a very public way. The woman in the joke is offering herself up for sex in a way that is similar to how someone would offer up items for sale at a yard sale, and the man is taking advantage of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's response to the situation is completely nonchalant. He doesn't seem to mind that his wife is role-playing as an insect during sex, and in fact makes a joke about how they were able to find the props for her insect-themed sexual game at a yard sale. This implies that the couple has done this before, and that they have a sense of humor about it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a non-sequitur: the woman's statement about loving yard sales doesn't have anything to do with the context of the situation, which is that she's acting out a sexual fetish with her husband. The joke is implying that the woman's fetish is so out-there and bizarre that even the simplest things, like yard sales, turn her on.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the woman is sitting on top of the man in a way that suggests she wants to have sex with him, but the fact that he is wearing a football helmet suggests that he is not interested in having sex with her. The fly swatter is a double entendre, because it can be used to kill insects (which the woman is pretending to be) or to swat a fly (which is a synonym for having sex).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "this is why I love you." In this case, the man is saying that he loves yard sales because he was able to find a fly swatter (which is a tool used to kill flies, which are insects). The woman, who has a sexual fetish for pretending to be an insect, is thus the perfect partner for him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the wife is pretending to be a bug, and the husband is participating in her fantasy by wearing a football helmet (to protect himself from her "bug bites"). The fly swatter is a prop being used in their game, which the husband loves because he found it at a yard sale. The joke is clever because it's a double entendre: the wife is "swatting" her husband with a fly swatter as part of their sexual game, but "swatting" also has a meaning of striking someone with a fly swatter to kill a fly.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's husband is kill insects for a living --- he's a fly swatter. The woman loves yard sales because that's where he usually finds his equipment. However, in this situation, the wife is using the husband's equipment for her own sexual pleasure.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "This is why I love married life." The woman in the picture is acting out a sexual fetish, and the husband seems to have found a novel way to kill two birds with one stone: by using a yard sale-bought fly swatter, he can swat flies and also fulfill his wife's sexual needs.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the woman loves pretending to be an insect during sex (a yard sale is a place where one might find cheap bug-related items like a fly swatter), and the husband likely enjoys finding odd and unexpected things at yard sales. The fact that the joke revolves around a taboo subject matter makes it even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's an unexpected punchline to the situation. The joke is clever because it's a play on words; instead of the woman's "love" for her husband, the joke is about the man's enjoyment of finding unexpected treasures at yard sales. In this case, the woman is the "treasure" because she is participating in his fetish.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="99.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="101.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
