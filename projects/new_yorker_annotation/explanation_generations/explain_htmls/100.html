That's a good start.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that people often see therapists to help them deal with their problems. In this case, the "patient" is an electric car, which is an unusual thing to see in a therapist's office. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the fact that electric cars are often seen as being environmentally friendly and "green."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is talking to an inanimate object, which is not something that would normally happen. It's also funny because the car is an electric car, which are often associated with being environmentally friendly and "green." The joke suggests that even though the car is electric, it still has some sort of emotional problem that it needs to work on.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's absurd that a car would be in a therapist's office, and even more absurd that the therapist would be talking to it like it's a patient. The joke is further funny because the therapist's response is a non-response, which is what many therapists say to their patients anyway.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The electric car "got itself here," meaning it drove here under its own power, but it could also be interpreted to mean that the car is in therapy because it has emotional issues. The therapist is saying that the fact that the car got itself here is a good start, meaning either that the car drove here on its own or that the car is in therapy to deal with its emotional issues.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The car is autonomous, meaning it can drive itself, but the therapist is saying that the car's ability to get itself to the therapist's office is a good start --- a good start towards what, we don't know, but the joke is implying that the car is in therapy for some reason.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is treating the car as if it is a patient, but the car is not a sentient being and therefore cannot respond to the therapist. In this way, the joke is a play on the fact that many people believe that therapy is not helpful because the therapist is just talking to themselves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "you're making progress" which is often used as encouragement in therapy. However, in this case, the progress being made is that the car has managed to get itself to the therapist's office. This is absurd because cars cannot think or make decisions for themselves, yet the therapist is treating the car as if it is a sentient being.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is absurd. The therapist is talking to the car as if it is a patient, and the car is apparently sentient. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the car "got" itself to the therapist's office, but it is also "got" in the sense of having a problem.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the car, an inanimate object, is in therapy and the therapist is trying to give it a pep talk. The therapist is telling the car that the fact that it got itself to therapy is a good start, which is ironic because the car couldn't have gotten itself there without a driver.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The car got "itself" to therapy, which is a large feat for an inanimate object, but it's also a car, so it's only a good start. The therapist is also hinting that the car might not be the only one with issues, as the car drove itself to therapy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is talking to the car like it's a patient. The car is in the therapist's office because it's having some sort of problem, presumably because it's electric. The therapist is trying to help the car, but the car is having trouble understanding why it's there.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the therapist is treating the car like it's a person who has come to therapy to talk about its issues. The therapist is trying to get the car to realize that it's made progress by coming to therapy, but of course, the car didn't do that on its own, someone drove it there. Thus, the therapist is unintentionally pointing out how absurd it is to be treating a car like a person in therapy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The car is autonomous, meaning it can drive itself, but the therapist is using the word "autonomous" to mean that the car is in control of its own emotions or mental state. The car has come to the therapist to talk about its feelings, and the therapist is trying to encourage it by saying that the fact that it drove itself there is a good start.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The car "got itself here," meaning it drove here, but it could also be interpreted to mean that the car has taken the first step in getting help by coming to therapy. The therapist's response is sarcastic, as the car cannot actually benefit from therapy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the car is the patient and the therapist is trying to help it with its existential crisis. The joke also pokes fun at the fact that cars are becoming increasingly autonomous, and might one day achieve sentience.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="99.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="101.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
