"Confection" can refer to both a type of food (gingerbread is a confection) and to an illness or disease. In this case, the gingerbread man is sick, and the doctors and chefs are trying to figure out what is wrong with him. The fact that they are all wearing chef's uniforms is also a play on the fact that they are trying to diagnose a food-related illness.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The doctor is saying that the gingerbread man's condition has worsened, but he's also saying that the gingerbread man is made of confectionery, or sweets. The joke is clever because it's double meaning is only apparent after a moment's thought.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The "confession" the gingerbread man has spread is not a religious confession, but rather the news that he is made of gingerbread, which has clearly spread through the hospital staff given their excited reactions. The gingerbread man himself is nervous because, as a sentient being, he knows he is going to be eaten and is presumably aware of the chefs' intentions.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "confection" can mean a food that is made from sugar or flour, like a gingerbread man. However, it can also mean something that is fake or untrue. In this case, the gingerbread man is fake, because he is not a real person. The joke is also funny because it is a pun on the word "infection." An infection is something that spreads, and in this case, the confection has spread, meaning it has gone to other parts of the gingerbread man's body.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it uses a wordplay on the word "confection". A confection is a type of food, typically a candy or sweet, but it can also refer to a decorative element in a dish, such as a gingerbread man. In this case, the gingerbread man is literally a confection, but he is also suffering from a "confection" --- an illness. The wordplay is clever and funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the gingerbread man's condition. The word "confection" can mean a food that is made with sugar or a medicine/drug that is made from different ingredients. In this case, the confection refers to the gingerbread man's body, which is made of gingerbread and other ingredients, and it has "spread" because he is lying on a baking sheet in the oven. The chef's excitement and the gingerbread man's nervousness add to the humor of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "confession" can mean an act of admitting something, usually something bad or illegal that you have done. In this case, theconfession is that the gingerbread man is made of gingerbread, which is a type of cookie.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "confection" can mean both a dessert and an infection. In this case, the gingerbread man has a "confection" in the sense of an infection, i.e., his gingerbread body is being taken over by actual sugar cookies.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The doctor is referring to the gingerbread man's affliction, which is that he is made of gingerbread, and thus, is slowly being eaten by the chefs. However, the phrase "the confection has spread" could also mean that the gingerbread man's condition is getting worse, as in, he is becoming more and more gingerbread-like. The double meaning of the phrase is what makes it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the doctor is telling the gingerbread man that he has "spread", meaning, he has gotten bigger/larger. But, the other meaning of "spread" is to apply icing or frosting on a cake or cookie --- in this case, the gingerbread man is the cake or cookie. So, the joke is that the gingerbread man is being iced/frosted by the chefs, who are excited about it, while the gingerbread man is nervous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "confection" the doctor is referring to is the gingerbread man, who is literally a confection (a sweet food). However, the word "confection" can also mean an infectious disease, which is what the doctor is saying has spread. The joke is clever because it's a double-meaning that not everyone will get, but those who do will find it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because when a doctor says that something has "spread," it usually means that a disease has spread or that an injury is worse than it initially appeared. In this case, however, the confection refers to the gingerbread man's body, which is made of gingerbread. The joke is that the gingerbread man is slowly being eaten by the chefs, who are excited because they are getting a taste of the gingerbread man.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The doctor is telling the gingerbread man that he is "afraid" the confection (i.e. the gingerbread) has spread. In other words, the gingerbread man is slowly becoming more gingerbread-like as he is progressively being eaten away.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "I'm afraid the cancer has spread", which would be a very serious diagnosis. However, in this case, the "confession" is that the gingerbread man has become too well-liked and popular, and as a result, he is being mobbed by adoring chefs. While not a life-threatening situation, it is nonetheless a serious matter for the gingerbread man, who is seeking medical help to deal with his sudden celebrity.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="43.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="45.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
