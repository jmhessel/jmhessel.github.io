In the context of the joke, the matador is telling the bull that he (the bull) had the matador at the point where they started dancing together. This is humorous because it's not what matadors and bulls typically do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "you had me at olé" is usually said to mean "you had me at hello," as in, the speaker was already won over by the other person before they even said anything. However, in this case, the matador is saying it to the bull, implying that the bull had won him over with its dancing, rather than its fighting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The matador is flirting with the bull, and saying "you had me at olé" is a pun on the phrase "you had me at hello", meaning that the person was won over by the other person at the first moment they met them. In this case, the matador is saying that the bull won him over at the first olé, meaning the first time the bull performed the move in bullfighting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the phrase "you had me at hello", which is used to mean that the speaker was won over by the other person from the beginning. In this case, the matador is saying that he was won over by the bull when it started dancing, even though bullfighting is traditionally a sport where the matador kills the bull. The humorous contrast between the violent sport and the seemingly innocuous dance is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common phrase "you had me at hello." In this case, the matador is telling the bull that he was won over when the bull started dancing, rather than when it said hello. This is silly because, as mentioned, bulls cannot dance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because in bullfighting, the matador tries to kill the bull, and so the fact that they are dancing together is incongruous. The fact that the bull is willingly participating in the dance makes it even funnier. The joke is also a play on the phrase "you had me at hello," which is often used to describe someone falling in love at first sight. In this case, the matador is falling in love with the bull, which is obviously not going to end well for the matador.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The matador is not actually interested in the bull, but he's pretending to be interested in order to get the bull to lower its guard. The phrase "you had me at olé" is a reference to the movie Jerry Maguire, in which the main character, Jerry, tells the woman he loves, "you had me at hello." In the movie, this is a very romantic thing to say, but in the context of the joke, it's funny because the matador is using it as a way to trick the bull.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "You had me at olé" is a famous line from the movie Jerry Maguire, in which the character Jerry Maguire (played by Tom Cruise) is trying to win back his girlfriend. In the movie, the line is meant to be romantic and sincere. However, in this situation, the matador is saying it to the bull, and it's not romantic or sincere --- instead, it's funny because the matador is basically saying that he's going to kill the bull.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "you had me at hello" is a famous line from the movie Jerry Maguire, and it means that the person being spoken to was already won over by the speaker before they even said anything. In this case, the matador has won over the bull by starting to dance with it, rather than fight it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The matador is supposed to say "ole" to the bull, which is a traditional Spanish cry of encouragement, but in this case, the matador is saying it to the bull as a way to flirt with him. The fact that they are dancing together is also a play on the fact that normally bulls and matadors are fighting one another.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "you had me at hello", which is often used to describe someone falling in love at first sight. In this case, the matador has fallen in love with the bull, and instead of hello, they are saying olé, which is a word often used in bullfighting. The joke is clever because it's a play on words.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The matador is saying that the bull had him (or, caught his attention) at the Spanish word for "cheers" or "thank you", olé. But in this context, the matador is about to be fighting the bull, so it's a ironic that he would say that the bull had him at olé, since the bull will soon have him (or, kill him).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the matador is flirting with the bull, and he's using a line from the movie "Jerry Maguire" to do it. This is ironic because in the movie, the line is used by a man to tell a woman that he loves her, but in this case, the matador is using it to tell the bull that he loves him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The matador is supposed to be saying "you had me at hello" but because they are bullfighting in Spain, he says "you had me at olé" instead. The joke is funny because it's a play on words and because it's a very unexpected situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The matador is speaking to the bull, and he's saying that he liked the bull from the moment they met ("You had me at [the word] olé"). This is funny because it's a reversal of the traditional roles: usually, it's the matador who is supposed to be fighting the bull, not the other way around.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="43.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="45.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
