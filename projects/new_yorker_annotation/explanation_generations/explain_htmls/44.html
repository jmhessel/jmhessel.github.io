The chameleon's presence in the therapist's office is unexpected and humorous, especially because the therapist's comment implies that the chameleon's invisibility is not a symptom of a mental illness.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in order for the chameleon to not be seen at its previous two appointments, it must have changed colors to blend in with its surroundings. The chameleon's ability to change colors is what allowed it to go unnoticed at the appointments, and the therapist is using this fact to make a joke about the chameleon's attendance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The chameleon is trying to look at the therapist's notes to see what the therapist has been saying about it. However, the therapist is asking the chameleon if it missed its last two appointments, which is a different meaning of the word "miss." In this context, "miss" means to not attend/show up for something. The chameleon "missed" its appointments because it was not there, but it was not there because it is a chameleon. The play on words is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="43.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="45.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
