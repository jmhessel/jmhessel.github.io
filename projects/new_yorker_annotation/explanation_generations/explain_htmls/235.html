Dinner is at six.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the other room is considering a giant donut. The implication is that he is hungry, and the women are joking that they hope he discovers fire soon so that he can cook himself dinner. The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that, in some cultures, women are traditionally responsible for cooking.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the other room is chiseling a stone wheel, which is a very old-fashioned way of making a wheel. This is a reference to the Stone Age, when people did not have fire. The joke is that the woman hopes that the man will discover fire soon, so that they can cook dinner. However, the man is already using fire to chisel the stone wheel, so the woman's hope is moot.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is considering a giant donut and the woman is hoping he discovers fire soon. This is a play on words because "discovering fire" is a metaphor for progress (i.e., fire was a discover that allowed humans to cook food and have warmer homes). However, in this context, the woman is literally hoping that the man discovers fire so that he can cook their dinner.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it satirizes the process of human evolution. The man in the other room is dressed in a loincloth, which is possibly a reference to the prehistoric era. The women in the living room seem to be his wife and mother-in-law, and they are fully clothed in modern clothes. The wife makes a joke about her husband discovering fire, which would be a significant moment in human history, but she is more concerned about him being able to make dinner on time. The joke implies that women have always been more interested in domestic matters than in the grand scheme of human evolution.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's implied that the man is chiseling a stone wheel in an attempt to create fire, a process which can take a long time. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the common saying "dinner is at six," implying that the speaker is not particularly hungry and would prefer to wait until the man has actually started a fire.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "the wheel of life." In this case, the man has not yet discovered fire, so he is living in a very primitive state. The joke is that even though he is living in this primitive state, the women expect him to still be able to make dinner on time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common phrase "the Wheel of Fortune", which is a game show where contestants spin a wheel to determine their prize. In this case, the wheel is huge and carved, and the man is just staring at it, as if he's trying to figure out what it is. The joke is that he's not making any progress, and the women hope he'll discover fire soon, so they can have dinner.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is staring at the wheel as if it is some sort of primitive artifact. The joke is that he is so engrossed in trying to figure out how the wheel works that he has lost track of time, and dinner is now ready. The joke is a play on the clich√©d idea of the "caveman" who is uninterested in anything beyond the basics of survival.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is implied that the man has been working on the stone wheel for a long time, and the women are getting impatient. The man is also not making much progress, as he has yet to discover fire. The women's hope that he discovers fire soon is both a hope that he will be able to cook dinner, and a hope that he will make some sort of breakthrough in his work.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is implied that the man is using the stone wheel to try and create fire, a crucial element of early human life. However, he has not yet succeeded, and the woman is getting impatient. The joke is also funny because it is a play on the fact that humans have domesticated dogs, which are descendants of wolves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the comedy comes from the incongruity of the situation: there is a giant donut in the other room, and the man is considering it as if it's a normal object. However, the donut is so large that it's comical to think of the man as being able to eat it. Furthermore, the woman's comment about hoping he discovers fire soon suggests that the man is not just considering the donut, but is also trying to figure out how to cook it. This is humorous because it's a very difficult task to cook a donut that size.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the two women are drinking tea, which is a traditionally English beverage, and they are hoping that the man will soon discover fire, which is a traditionally Native American invention. The joke is clever because it reverses the roles: usually, it is the Native Americans who are hoping that the English will discover fire, so that they can have tea.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is implied that the man is trying to invent the wheel, which is a common trope for someone who is innovating but not very good at it. In this case, the man is so bad at it that he hasn't even discovered fire yet, which is a very basic element of human civilization. The fact that the women are just calmly drinking tea and not helping the man or being frustrated with him adds to the humor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the ancient story of humans discovering fire. The man in the room is looking at the wheel as if it's some sort of new invention, when in fact it's a very old one. The women in the other room are discussing how long he'll be looking at it, and one hope he discovers fire soon so that dinner can be made on time.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the other room is so engrossed in trying to figure out how to eat the giant donut that he hasn't even noticed that the women in the other room are making fun of him. The joke is also clever because it playfully alludes to the fact that humans discovered fire by using it to cook food.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="234.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="236.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
