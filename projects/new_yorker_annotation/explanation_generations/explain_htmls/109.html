The salesman's comment about the car running like a dream is ironic because, typically, people have nightmares about monsters, rather than dreams.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a surrealist image: a car with a monster face and legs. The surrealism is compounded by the salesman's nonchalant explanation of the car's features. In this case, the joke is less about the unusual situation and more about the salesman's reaction to it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the salesman is trying to sell the car by saying that it's like a dream, which is not realistic. Dreams are often bizarre and nonsensical, like this car, so the salesman's analogy is not comforting.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the car has a monster face, which would make it look like it would run erratically, like a monster. However, the salesman says that it runs like a dream, which is the opposite of what one would expect. This discrepancy creates humor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is looking at a car that is so ridiculous that it can only be compared to a dream, which are by their very nature unrealistic. The joke also cleverly plays on the double meaning of the word "runs": not only does the car have actual running legs, but it also runs smoothly, like a dream.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "she runs like a dream" is often used to describe how perfectly a car operates, but in this case, the salesman is saying it about the car's long, lanky legs. The dream part of the joke refers to the fact that cars with legs is something that only exists in dreams (or nightmares), which makes the perfect operation of the car all the more surprising.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the car has bizarre modifications, the salesman is still trying to sell it to the couple. He's complimenting the car by saying it runs like a dream, but the dream he's referring to is probably a nightmare, given the car's appearance.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the salesman is suggesting that the car runs so fast, it's like a dream. But, because the car has no wheels, it's actually impossible for it to run. Dreams are often seen as being unreal and impossible, so the salesman's comment is pointing out the ridiculousness of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is horrified by the car, but the salesman is trying to sell it to them by saying it runs like a dream. The dream he's referring to is probably a nightmare, given the reaction of the couple.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the salesman is trying to make the sale by saying that the car is just like a dream, but the fact that he says "I once had" makes it clear that he's not talking about an actual car, but a dream he had, which makes it less impressive.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the car salesman is describing the car as if it's a normal car, even though it's clear that it's not. The joke is playing on the fact that people often use the phrase "runs like a dream" to describe a car that runs smoothly and efficiently. However, in this context, the phrase takes on a new meaning since the car doesn't actually have any wheels.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the car is a creature that is running, it's not running in the traditional sense. The dream comparison emphasizes this fact by pointing out that the car is running in an unusual way, like a dream.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the car, with its cat features, is so bizarre that it could only exist in a dream. The speaker is saying that the car drives well, despite its strange appearance, which is a relief.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the car is so bizarre that it can only be described in terms of a dream, which are often weird and nonsensical. The fact that the dream is specifically a nightmare makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the salesman is trying to sell the couple on the car by saying that it runs like a dream, but the fact that the car has a monster face and legs makes it clear that this is not a normal car. The contrast between the normalality of a car running like a dream and the abnormality of the car's features is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="108.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="110.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
