In this case, the lion tamer is not only failing to control the lions, but one of the lions is calmly talking on the phone and seems to be the one in control. The joke is also funny because it subverts the expectation that the lion is calling 9-1-1 for help, when in fact, the lion is calling to tell the tamer to stop whipping the other lion because she has a learning disability.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the emergency call center's famous phrase, "Can you describe the situation for me?" In this case, the caller is describing a situation where a lion tamer is being mauled by one of his lions, but he keeps calm and tries to explain that the lion tamer's life could be saved if he would just stop using the whip and try to understand that the lion has a learning disability.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the lion is on the phone with someone, presumably 9-1-1, asking for help with the situation. The lion is calm, whereas the tamer is struggling to keep the other lion at bay. The joke pokes fun at the idea of a wild animal being more level-headed than a human in this situation.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="108.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="110.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
