The joke is implying that they are still subject to the law, and they will be caught and brought back to face the grand jury.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The person who left behind the empty suit won't get "far" in the sense that they won't escape justice, but "far" can also mean a long distance, which is what the person has most likely done.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the phrase "he won't get far" is usually said about someone who has been caught or is about to be caught. In this context, the person has literally gotten away, by becoming invisible, and so the person who said "he won't get far" is wrong. The humor in the joke comes from the contrast between the person's escape and the normal usage of the phrase.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the empty suit is, technically, the one on trial. And yet, because it's just a piece of clothing, it's not going to be able to do anything, let alone "get far." The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: "he won't get far" can mean either that the person won't escape or that the person won't be successful in whatever they're trying to do. In this case, it's both: the person won't escape because they're not actually there, and they won't be successful because they're just a piece of clothing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on trial has literally gotten far; he is not in the courtroom anymore. The joke is also funny because it's a pun on the phrase "he won't get far," which is often used to describe someone who is not going to be successful. In this case, the man on trial has been successful in escaping the courtroom, despite the fact that he is still technically on trial.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who is being judged by the grand jury has literally disappeared, making it impossible for them to "get far." The joke is also funny because the person who is being judged is probably trying to escape the consequences of their actions, but the fact that they are invisible means that they can't go very far without being seen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the person on trial has seemingly escaped, they haven't actually gotten away: they are still wearing the empty suit. The joke is a play on the saying, "he won't get far" meaning that the person won't escape justice, which is ironic given the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because even though the person on trial has escaped, the evidence of their presence is still there: the empty suit. This means that even though the person has evaded justice for now, they won't be able to do so forever, since eventually they will be caught and will have to face the consequences.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who is the target of the grand jury has literally escaped/evaded justice by becoming invisible. The fact that the person is still visible as a silhouette in the empty suit is what makes the joke humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that the person who is on trial has literally "gotten away" by becoming invisible. The speaker is using a idiom, "he won't get far," which means the speaker thinks the person will be caught soon, but in this case, the person has literally gotten away and the speaker is wrong.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person who was supposed to be on trial has escaped, and the only thing left is an empty suit. The person who made the joke is saying that the person who escaped won't be able to go very far; this is because, without a body in the suit, the person will eventually be caught.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because even though the person on trial has escaped, they won't be able to avoid punishment for long. The person who made this joke is confident that the justice system will catch up to the person eventually.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because even though the person on trial has escape, they will eventually be caught because they are still wearing their invisibility cloak. Even though they are technically "invisible," they are still wearing clothes, which will be a dead giveaway.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, even though the person on trial has escaped, they are still technically guilty; the fact that they are invisible does not change that. The joke is a play on the proverb, "you can run, but you can't hide," meaning that eventually, justice will catch up to you.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man who is on trial has escaped, and the jury is sure that he won't get very far. The jury is saying that even though the man has escaped, he is still going to be held accountable for his actions. The joke is clever because, in a legal sense, the man has gotten away (escaped), but in a moral sense, he is still accountable (jailed).</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
