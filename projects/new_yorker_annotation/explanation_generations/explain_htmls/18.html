The joke is clever because, while the hole in the middle of the wheel is a potential design flaw, it's also necessary for the wheel to function, in the same way that a hole in the middle of a donut is necessary for the donut to be eaten.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is staring at the wheel because he's thinking about how he could have made it better. The implication is that he's an inventor or engineer of some sort, and he's thinking about how he could have made the wheel better if he had been the one to design it. The hole in the middle of the wheel is a reference to the axle, which is necessary for the wheel to rotate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the wheel is a symbol of the sun, and the hole in the middle is the hole in the sun's corona. The man is saying that he was responsible for the idea of the sun's corona, which is a funny thing to claim credit for.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="17.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="19.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
