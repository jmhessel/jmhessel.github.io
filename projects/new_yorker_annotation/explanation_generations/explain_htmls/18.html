The sandwich on the tracks is a "sub", which is short for "submarine sandwich". The Secretary of Transportation is in charge of, among other things, the subway. So, the joke is implying that the person who appointed Chris Christie to that position is responsible for the sandwich being on the tracks.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "transportation" can mean both the mode of transport (e.g. a subway) or the act of moving something from one place to another (e.g. a sandwich). In this case, the sandwich is being transported by the subway (i.e. the sandwich is on the tracks), but the fact that Chris Christie is the Secretary of Transportation (i.e. in charge of the subway) is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Appoint" can mean both to give someone a job, as in appointing someone to be Secretary of Transportation, or to put something in a particular place, as in appointing the sandwich onto the tracks. In this case, the president appoints Chris Christie, who is known for being large, as Secretary of Transportation, and in doing so, also appoints the sandwich onto the tracks.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the large sandwich on the tracks is there because Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey and Secretary of Transportation in the Trump administration, appointed himself to the position. This is absurd because it's not possible to appoint oneself to a position in the US government. The joke is made funnier by the fact that the large sandwich is blocking the tracks, and so it's causing a transportation problem, which is Christie's area of responsibility.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the similarities between the two objects: both are large, both are located in the subway, and both have the word "sub" in them. The joke is a play on the fact that the word "sub" can mean both a submarine sandwich and a subway train. The fact that the man in the joke appointed Chris Christie, who is often lampooned for his large size, as Secretary of Transportation, makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the large size of the sandwich is unexpected and it is blocking the subway tracks, making it difficult for the train to get by. This is a humorous take on the fact that the sandwich is an obstacle in the path of the subway train. The joke is also a play on words, as the word "transportation" can also refer to moving people or things from one place to another, and in this case, the large sandwich is effectively preventing the subway train from transporting people.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The President appoints the Secretary of Transportation, and in this case, the large sandwich on the tracks is blocking the subway (i.e., public transportation). The joke is clever because it is a multi-layered pun: not only is the sandwich blocking the subway tracks (i.e., the transportation), but the sandwich is also from Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey who was infamously caught eating a large sandwich on a beach that was closed to the public.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "submarine" can mean both a type of sandwich, and a type of vessel that goes under water. In this case, the submarine is a sandwich, but it's also a reference to the fact that the new Secretary of Transportation is Chris Christie, who is known for his love of sandwiches.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "transportation" can mean both the act of moving something from one place to another, and also the system of vehicles, like trains and buses, that are used to move people and goods around. In this context, the joke is suggesting that the person who appointed Chris Christie as Secretary of Transportation was responsible for the giant sandwich being on the subway tracks, because it was their job to oversee the transportation system.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "sub" in "submarine sandwich" is pronounced like the "sub" in "subway," so when the sandwich is on the tracks, it sounds like it's a subway train that's stuck. But then the joke takes it one step further by saying that the sandwich is actually Chris Christie, the current Secretary of Transportation. The joke is clever because it's a play on words, and it's also topical, since Chris Christie is a current political figure.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the size of the sandwich is comically large, and it's a play on the phrase "subway sandwich": in this case, the sandwich is so big that it's literally a sandwich the size of a subway. The joke is also a jab at President Donald Trump's decision to appoint Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, to head the Department of Transportation, despite Christie having no prior experience with transportation policy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase " submarine sandwich" is a homonym for the word "submarine," and the man and woman on the subway are looking at a big submarine sandwich on the tracks. In this context, the big sandwich is a play on the word "Christie," as in, former New Jersey governor Chris Christie. The joke is that Christie was appointed as Secretary of Transportation by President Donald Trump, and the big sandwich on the tracks is a play on the fact that Christie is known for his love of food.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "transportation" can mean either the act of moving something from one place to another, or the mode of transportation (like a subway). In this case, the man is using the word "transportation" to mean the latter, and is saying that the huge subway sandwich was appointed by the government to be the Secretary of Transportation. This is a play on the real-life appointment of former New Jersey governor Chris Christie to be the real Secretary of Transportation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the large size of the sandwich on the tracks is a play on Christie's girth. Additionally, it's funny because appointing Christie to a position in Trump's cabinet is a bit of a joke in and of itself, given Christie's low approval ratings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the sandwich is so large that it could be mistaken for a subway train. The comparison to Chris Christie is funny because Christie is a large man, and appointing him as Secretary of Transportation is a joke in and of itself because it would be a terrible idea.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="17.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="19.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
