From this elevated position, he can see the entire game and make better decisions. However, his unusual position means that he is still evolving his understanding of the game and his role in it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "pitch" can refer to both the field in baseball where the game is played, as well as the act of throwing the ball. Thus, the umpire is saying that his position on the field is constantly changing, since he has to move around to follow the ball.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because umpires are not supposed to be on a podium in the middle of the baseball field. They are supposed to be on the ground with the players. The announcers are the ones who are supposed to be on the podium. So, the joke is making fun of the umpire for not knowing where he is supposed to be.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the politician is equivocating on their stance on the issue at hand. This compares the act of hitting a baseball, which is essentially a form of attack, to the act of delivering a political speech, which is usually Prime Minister's Questions in the United Kingdom, a time for the Leader of the Opposition to grill the Prime Minister on their policies. In this way, the joke suggests that the politician is more concerned with attack than with actual policy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The umpire is not where he is supposed to be, on the ground with the players, but rather he is "evolving" his position to be up in a announcer's box. This is a pun because the word "pitch" can mean both the location on a baseball field where the game is played, as well as the act of throwing a ball. So the umpire is saying that his position on the "pitch" is still "evolving," or changing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The umpire is supposed to be on the ground with the players, but instead he's on a podium. This play on words is also a light-hearted jab at the umpire's authority; by saying that his "position on the pitch is still evolving," it suggests that he doesn't know what he's doing and is making up the rules as he goes along.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the umpire is on a raised platform instead of on the ground with the players, as is traditional. The umpire's position is "evolving" because it's higher than it used to be, which gives them a better view of the game, but is also less traditional.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the politician is giving a speech at a baseball game, and he says "my position on the pitch is still evolving." The word "pitch" can mean two things in this context: (1) the act of throwing a ball in baseball, and (2) a political stance or opinion. Thus, the politician is saying that his opinion is still changing, which is funny because politicians are usually pretty set in their ways.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while the politician says that their "position on the pitch is still evolving," they are actually referring to their position in regards to the baseball game (i.e., they are still learning and have not solidified their opinion). However, because they are using the term "pitch" instead of "game," it sounds like they are saying that their views on the topics being discussed in the game are still in flux, which is a humorous way to view a baseball game.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. "Pitch" has two meanings here: first, it is a reference to the baseball pitch, i.e., the act of throwing the ball. Second, it is a reference to the politician's position on an issue, which may evolve or change over time. The children are looking at him oddly because they don't understand the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The umpire is on a podium instead of on the ground with the players, which is where they are supposed to be. The joke is that the umpire's position is evolving, which is a pun on the fact that the umpire is on a podium, which is called a "podium," which is a play on the word "evolve."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the politician is talking about his "position on the pitch." In baseball, the "pitch" refers to the act of throwing the ball, and the "position" would be where the fielder is standing. However, the politician is using the word "pitch" to mean "point," as in, his "position on the issue," i.e., where he stands on it. The children are looking at him oddly because they don't understand what he's talking about.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. In baseball, the "pitcher" is the player who throws the ball, and the "batter" is the player who hits the ball. However, in this situation, the umpire is on a pitching machine, which is a machine that throws balls. So, the umpire is referring to the evolution of his position on the field from being on the ground to being on the pitching machine.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the umpire is making a play on words. The umpire's position is on the podium, which is elevated above the ground, so he jokes that his position is "evolving" --- in other words, he's still figuring out where he should be positioned. This joke would be funnier if the umpire was actually on the ground with the players, as that would make it more unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the politician is saying that his opinion on the location of the baseball pitch (the area where the children are playing and the game is taking place) is still changing. This is a play on words because "pitch" can refer to either the location of the game or a sales pitch, as in, an attempt to sell something. In this case, the politician is saying that he hasn't decided yet whether he supports the children playing at this location.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
