I'm at the window. To the right? Your right or my right?</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at the common situation where people on the phone have difficulty communicating where the other person is. In this case, the monster is outside the window, and the man on the phone is trying to describe to the person on the other end where the monster is. The joke is made funnier by the fact that monsters are not real, so the person on the other end of the phone must think the man is either joking or crazy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man on the phone is asking the person on the other end for direction, but because there is a monster on his right, he is clarifying that he wants to know which way the person on the other end is facing, so that he can better orient himself. Thus, the person on the other end of the line must be very confused as to why the man is asking such a clarifying question.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man on the phone is looking for the monster, and he asks if themonster is to the right. The other person responds that it depends on whose right you're talking about. This is a play on the word "right," which can mean both "correct" and "direction." The joke is clever because it's a double meaning that not everybody would catch.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the fact that the situation is surreal and confusing. The man on the phone is trying to describe to the person on the other end where the monster is, but because the situation is so confusing, he can't even figure out which way is right.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man, who is inside looking out the window at the monster, is having a conversation with someone who is presumably not in the room with him. The person on the other end of the line is telling him to look at the monster, but the man doesn't know which way is which, because he is situated in the room and the other person isn't. To the man, left and right are reversed, so he has to ask which way is which.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man on the phone is asking the person he is speaking to for directions to where the monster is, but he is also asking which right (side) they should look from. The situation is made more absurd by the fact that the man is drinking wine, as if he is casually observing the situation rather than being in danger.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the phone is talking to someone who is telling him to look for a monster outside, but the man can't tell which direction the other person is talking about. The joke is a play on the fact that people can have different points of view, and that it can be confusing to try to communicate when you don't share the same frame of reference.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the phone is calmly discussing the giant monster as if it's a normal thing, when in reality, it's a huge, life-threatening creature. The fact that he is more concerned with orienting the person he's talking to than with the monster itself is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man on the phone is talking to someone who is telling him to look for a monster outside, but the man doesn't know which direction he should be looking. Is the caller referring to their right, or the man's right? The joke is clever because it can be interpreted two ways.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man on the phone is talking to someone who can see the monster climbing the building, and the other person is trying to guide the man on the phone to where the monster is. The man on the phone is confused about which right is being referred to, and the joke is that he is more concerned with the orientation of his body than the fact that there is a monster outside.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man on the phone is trying to figure out which direction the monster is, but he gets confused because he doesn't know whether the other person is referring to the right side from their perspective or from his perspective. This confusion would not happen if the man was looking at a normal object, but because he's looking at a monster, it's humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man, even though he is seeing a monster clinging to the outside of his apartment building, is more concerned with whether the person he is talking to on the phone is using the same frame of reference as he is when they ask him to look to the right. The monster is not a threat to him, so he is not worried about it, but he is worried about confusing the person on the phone.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's nonchalant attitude towards the monster implies that he's seen monsters before, and this is just another day for him. The fact that he's confused about which way the monster is facing is a detail that reinforces how matter-of-fact he is about the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the phone is describing the monster to someone who is presumably not in the same room, and is using terms that are relative to his own perspective. The other person on the phone doesn't know which way the man is facing, so the joke confuses them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the confusion that can often arise when people are trying to describe something's location over the phone. In this case, the man is trying to describe the location of the monster to the person on the other end of the line, but it's unclear if he is using their right or his right as a reference point. The confusion is compounded by the fact that the monster is on the other side of the building, so even if the person on the other end of the line could see it, they wouldn't be able to tell which direction the man was facing.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="76.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="78.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
