Try again.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the cowboy on the horse is trying to figure out why the other cowboy, on the bug, looks so strange. He initially thinks it might be a new haircut, but then realizes that can't be it because it's too drastic of a change. The answer, of course, is that the cowboy is riding a giant bug, which is much stranger than a new haircut.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the horse assumes that the man on the giant bug must be a cowboy like him, just with a different haircut. However, the man on the bug is not a cowboy, he's just riding a giant bug.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the horse has a very strange haircut, with his hair parted in the middle and hanging down over his face.
