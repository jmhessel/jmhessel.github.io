The man is looking at the other man's pregnant belly and saying that no one expects an immaculate conception (i.e., a virgin birth) until it happens to him. This is funny because, of course, the man's belly wasn't the result of an immaculate conception, but rather, unprotected sex.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "immaculate conception" typically refers to the Christian belief that the Virgin Mary became pregnant with Jesus without having sex; in contrast, the man in this situation has become pregnant through sex. The joke is clever because it takes a phrase that is typically used to refer to a miraculous and impossible event, and applies it to a much more mundane situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the large beer gut is unexpectedly pregnant. The other man is surprised because he didn't think it was possible for the man to get pregnant, given his abdomen size. This is a play on the phrase "no one expects the Spanish Inquisition," which means that people are surprised when something unexpected happens, even though they really shouldn't be.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while in vitro fertilization and other medical interventions have made it so that pregnancy is no longer something that only happens through intercourse, the man's colleague's pregnancy still happened through intercourse --- an immaculate conception, in other words. The joke is playing on the double meaning of the word "immaculate": meaning both "perfect" and "conceived without sex."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the large stomach is clearly not pregnant, so the other man's comment about an immaculate conception is unexpected and ironic. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words; the immaculate conception is a Catholic doctrine about the Virgin Mary giving birth to Jesus without having sex, while the other man's comment is about him having a child without having sex.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The first meaning of "immaculate conception" is the religious belief that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was born without original sin. The second meaning is the scientific fact that all human beings are conceived when a sperm fertilizes an egg. In the context of the joke, the man's pregnant belly is a result of the second meaning of "immaculate conception," which is unexpected and surprising.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with his arms crossed is talking about how men usually don't get pregnant, but the other man has become pregnant through immaculate conception. The joke is poking fun at the man who is now pregnant because it is such an unusual situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man with the large belly is probably not pregnant, given that he's a man. The other man is surprised by this, as he probably thought that only women could get pregnant. The joke is clever because it plays on the double meaning of "immaculate conception", which can refer to either the Virgin Mary conceiving Jesus without sex, or a woman conceiving a child without sex.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it makes a play on words. The first meaning of "immaculate conception" is the religious meaning, which is when Mary was impregnated by God without having sex --- this is usually seen as a miracle. The second meaning is when a woman becomes pregnant without having sex, which is much less of a miracle. In this case, the man is pregnant without having sex, which is even less of a miracle, and thus, the joke is funny because it's unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "immaculate" can mean pure or spotless, but it can also refer to the Immaculate Conception, which is a Catholic belief about the Virgin Mary. In this case, the man's colleague is pregnant, which is a spotless or pure situation, but also a miraculous one, since it's improbable for a man to get pregnant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is play on words. The first half is a quote from wiki/The_Inquisition, and the second half is a reference to wiki/Immaculate_Conception. The contrast between the two concepts is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Immaculate conception" is usually used to refer to the religious belief that Mary, the mother of Jesus, conceived him without sin. However, in this joke, it's used to refer to the literal meaning of the phrase: conception without sex. This is ironic because while sex is usually necessary for conception, in this case, the man became pregnant without having sex, which is why it's so unexpected.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is talking about how he wasn't expecting to get pregnant, or have a large beer gut, but it happened anyway. This is a play on the phrase "imacculate conception," which is another way of saying "virgin birth."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Immaculate conception" is a phrase typically used to describe the Virgin Mary conceive Jesus without intercourse; in this context, the word "immaculate" is being used to describe the man's belly, which is big and bloated, as if he were pregnant. The other man's comment is funny because it's a non-sequitur: the fact that the man's belly is bloated doesn't mean that he underwent an immaculate conception.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's colleagues are surprised that he, a man, could get pregnant, given that pregnancy generally only happens to women. The man's large belly is a metaphor for a pregnant woman's belly, hence the joke.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="76.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="78.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
