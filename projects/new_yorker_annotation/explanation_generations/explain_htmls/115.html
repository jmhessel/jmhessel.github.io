The woman is on the phone with someone and she is telling them to bring name tags for the clones. The clones are all the same so the name tags are necessary.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a normal social situation where name tags might be used (like a conference or networking event), it would be helpful to have them so that people can remember each other's names. However, in this unusual situation where there are many clones of the same person, having name tags would be pointless, because everyone would just have the same name.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the fact that, in a room full of clones, it would be difficult to tell them apart without name tags. The woman on the phone is likely calling someone to bring name tags for the men, which goes to show how impractical it would be to have a room full of clones.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the common event where someone has an idea and then immediately realizes that it's not a good idea. In this case, the woman has an idea to bring name tags to the meeting, but then realizes that it's not a good idea because there are too many people and they are all clones. This would be a confusing and overwhelming situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it is impossible for there to be a bunch of identical men, in a room full of clones, name tags would be very useful to distinguish one from another. The woman's change of mind from not wanting name tags to wanting them emphasizes just how confusing it would be to have a bunch of clones around.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the clones will need name tags to tell them apart. This is a difficult task because they are all the same, so the woman's suggestion is a way to make it easier. The joke is also clever because it is a play on words: the name tags would normally be used to help people remember other people's names, but in this case, they would be used to help the clones remember their own names.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common party planning advice to bring name tags to events where people might not know each other. In this case, the name tags are necessary because there are so many clones that the woman can't tell them apart. Without the name tags, it would be impossible to tell the clones apart.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because when there are a lot of people in one place, it can be difficult to remember everyone's name, so name tags are often used in such situations. However, in this case, since the people are clones of the same person, it would be even more difficult to remember everyone's name, so the speaker suggests that name tags would be necessary. The absurdity of the situation is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in a room full of clones, it would be very difficult to know who is who without some sort of name tag or other form of identification. The woman on the phone is probably calling someone to tell them about the clones, and the person she is talking to suggests that name tags would be a good idea, given the confusing situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common event of people forgetting name tags for events. However, in this case, it's even more forgetful to not bring name tags because there are so many clones --- it would be impossible to remember everyone's name without name tags. Furthermore, the fact that the clones are identical makes the joke even funnier, because it would be even more difficult to tell them apart without name tags.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman on the phone is telling someone to bring name tags for the group of men, but because they are all clones, they don't need name tags, because they are all the same person. The joke is funny because it's a play on the expected use of name tags (to differentiate people) versus the actual use in this situation (to identify the clones).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that, when people meet someone new, they often want to put a name tag on them so they can remember who they are. However, in this situation, there are so many clones that it would be impossible to keep track of them all without name tags, so the speaker suggests that they bring them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it plays on the idea that identical clones would have a hard time telling each other apart. In a business setting, where everyone is wearing name tags, this would be an impossibility, and thus the clones would need some way of differentiating themselves. The joke could also be interpreted as a way of saying that the clones are not very bright, and thus need name tags to keep track of who is who.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, without name tags, it would be hard to tell the clone men apart from one another, and so the woman on the phone is saying that it might be helpful to have name tags after all, in order to keep track of them all. This is ironic because, in most situations, name tags would be unnecessary, but in this case, they would be very helpful.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, while it is impossible for there to be a bunch of people who look exactly the same, the woman's reaction is still something that would make sense if there were a bunch of people who looked exactly the same: she would need name tags to tell them apart. The impossibility of the situation is what makes it funny.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="114.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="116.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
