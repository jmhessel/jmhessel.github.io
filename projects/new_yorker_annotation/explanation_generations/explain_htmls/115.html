The nerdy man's gesture is undercut by the fact that it's not happening for the right person, making it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the cake is at the wrong table. He is presumably looking for the woman he is supposed to be romantic with, but instead he is at the table of another woman. The joke is clever because it plays on the double meaning of the word "romantic": in addition to being a reference to the stereotypically romantic gesture of a man coming out of a cake for his partner, it is also a homophone for "right", as in "the right table".</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the cake is at the wrong table: he's supposed to be at the table next to the woman, who is instead sitting at a table by herself. The man in the cake is thus mistakenly making a romantic gesture to the wrong woman, who is not amused.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is at a restaurant, presumably with a date, and a man in a tuxedo pops out of a cake in front of her. However, she is unimpressed because she is at the wrong table --- the man in the tuxedo is actually a waiter, and the cake is for another table. This is a play on the fact that often times, things that seem romantic are actually cliche or cheesy.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is a reversal of what is typically expected: instead of a woman being surprised with a cake, a man is surprised with a cake. The woman's reaction to the man coming out of the cake is also unexpected: instead of being excited or amused, she is unimpressed, as if this were an inconvenience. The punchline of the joke is that the man coming out of the cake is at the wrong table: instead of being at the table of the woman he wanted to surprise, he is at a different table entirely.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman is disappointed because the man coming out of the cake is at the wrong table: instead of being at her table as a gesture of affection, he's at a nearby table, where he presumably doesn't know the people sitting there. The joke could also be interpreted more broadly as a commentary on how easy it is to make a mistake when dating: even if two people are interested in each other, they might not end up at the same table, or in the same restaurant, which would make it impossible for them to meet.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the cake is at the wrong table, and so the woman he is smiling at is not his date. The joke is also funny because it points out the absurdity of the situation: why would a man suddenly jump out of a cake at a restaurant, and why would he do it at the wrong table?</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man coming out of the cake is supposed to be a romantic gesture, but because he's coming out of the wrong cake, at the wrong table, it's not romantic at all. This woman is probably not happy with her current situation, given that she was expecting romance and got a man coming out of a cake instead.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the movie "My Best Friend's Wedding", in which a man comes out of a cake to surprise his girlfriend at her engagement party. The man in this situation is either at the wrong table, or the woman he came out of the cake for is at the wrong table. In either case, it's a mix-up that results in an embarrassing situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The speaker is disappointed because the man in the tuxedo, who presumably came out of the cake as some sort of romantic gesture, is at the wrong table. This could be interpreted as meaning that the speaker is disappointed because the cake is at the wrong table, or that the speaker is disappointed because the man is at the wrong table --- he's at the wrong table, meaning he's not with the speaker, or he's at the wrong table, meaning he's not at the right restaurant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words: the woman is drinking wine at a table, and the man is coming out of a cake. The joke is that the man coming out of the cake is at the wrong table: instead of being at the woman's table, he's at another table. If he were at the right table, it would be a much more romantic gesture.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the nerdy man in the cake obviously went to a lot of effort to make a romantic gesture for the woman at the table, but he got the wrong table. The woman he intended to surprise is probably sitting at another table in the restaurant, and the woman at this table is just an innocent bystander who is being creeped out by the man in the cake staring at her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman says "this would be so romantic if this were the right table", but the word "romantic" can also be used as an adjective to describe the cake, i.e. "This would be so romantic if this were the right cake." The man coming out of the cake is thus a surprise for the wrong party, which makes it less romantic and more awkward.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The nerdy man in the cake is at the "top" of the cake, and so he is "top" of the romantic situation. However, he is not at the "right" table, which means he is not with the right woman. The woman he is with is not interested in him, and so the nerdy man is not in the right place romantically.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "The right table" can mean either the table that the woman is sitting at, or a table that is reserved for a special occasion like a romantic dinner. In this case, the woman is sitting at the former, but the latter would be more appropriate for the situation given that there is a man coming out of a cake.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="114.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="116.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
