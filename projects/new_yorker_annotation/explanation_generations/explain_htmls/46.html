The kitchen is full of traps, making it a potentially deadly place, and the joke is that the person wants to make it even more dangerous by adding a password, which would make it even harder for someone to escape.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is absurd: why would you need to trap or lock everything in your kitchen? The only reason to do so would be to keep people out, but the people who would be trying to get into the kitchen are presumably the people who live there. ThePassword joke implies that the situation is so absurd that even a password wouldn't be enough to keep people out.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "password" can mean two things: a word used to gain access to a locked account or device, or a word used to describe something that is kept secret. In this context, the couple is discussing whether or not they should add a password to their fridge, meaning a secret word that would tell a would-be thief which trap to avoid.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a comment on how the security measures people take to protect their homes often don't make much sense. In this case, the traps are so numerous and deadly that a password probably wouldn't make much difference.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the saying "that's the icing on the cake." In this case, the couple is discussing whether or not to add a password to their booby-trapped kitchen, which is the icing on the cake, or the final step in securing their home. This joke is also a play on the fact that people often use passwords that are easy to remember, like "cake."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the traps are out of place and seem dangerous, so the idea of adding a password to them implies that the people setting the traps don't want anyone to get hurt, but are also aware that the traps could hurt someone if they aren't careful.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is discussing whether or not they should add a password to the fridge, as if this would be a reasonable thing to do. This is absurd because a password would not deter a determined bear or other animal, and would only be a nuisance to the people living in the house who just want to get a snack.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is so paranoid about someone breaking into their home that they have taken to booby-trapping their kitchen with dangerous objects. The idea of adding a password to the fridge is ridiculous because it's already booby-trapped; a would-be thief would likely not make it to the fridge anyway.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is so dangerous: if someone were to accidentally walk into the kitchen, they would be met with a series of deadly traps. The fact that the two people are considering adding a password to the kitchen, as if it were a computer, emphasizes how out-of-place and unnecessary the traps are.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is taking security to an absurd extreme. They are so paranoid about their food being stolen that they have set up a series of traps, but the joke is that even this is not enough, and they are considering adding a password, which would make it even harder for people to get to the food. This level of security is excessive and unnecessary, making it funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is being so over-the-top with their security measures. A password adds an additional layer of security, but it also makes it more difficult for the couple to access their own fridge. The joke is poking fun at the idea that people can be too paranoid and go to extremes to protect themselves.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the couple is considering adding a password to their fridge, as if that would be an additional level of security to prevent someone from stealing their food. This is silly because a password wouldn't do anything to stop a determined thief; they would just find a way around it or break the Password (just like in the movie "Home Alone").</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it takes the idea of booby-trapping the kitchen to an absurd extreme. The couple is considering adding a password to the fridge, as if that would be the thing that stopped a daring thief from raiding their kitchen. This is silly because a password is not going to stop someone from breaking into a fridge, it would only stop someone from opening it once they were already in the kitchen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the addition of a password would be an absurdly ineffective measure to protect against the traps, which are all lethal. The joke is clever because it employs wordplay: a diet is often called a "regimen," and a password is needed to log-in to a computer. Thus, the person asking the question is suggesting a course of action that is equally as absurd as the traps in the kitchen.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the situation is so absurd: there are so many traps in the kitchen that it seems like whoever designed it wanted to kill anyone who came in. But the fact that the people in the kitchen are still alive and well shows that the traps must not be working very well. The question of whether or not to add a password to the kitchen just adds to the absurd situation.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="45.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="47.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
