Death is usually seen as a dark and scary figure, reaping lives with his scythe. However, in this joke, he is playfully shown as a more benign figure, giving lemons "from his farm" to the man. This is a humorous contrast to the traditional image of Death.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Grim Reaper, who is typically associated with death and darkness, is instead depicted as a farmer giving a couple lemons. The joke is clever because it is a play on the saying "when life gives you lemons, make lemonade." In this instance, the Grim Reaper is giving lemons directly to the couple, which would be farmers, thus implying that the lemons are part of a farm to table meal.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "farm to table," which is used to describe food that is sourced from local farms. In this case, the local farm is the Grim Reaper's field, and the food is lemons. The Grim Reaper is usually associated with death, so the joke is also a play on the fact that he is giving them lemons, which are sour and not typically associated with death.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the grim reaper, who normally symbolizes death, is instead giving life in the form of lemons. The joke is a play on the saying "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade," which means that you should make the best of a bad situation. In this case, the bad situation is death, and the best thing to do is to make lemonade.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on the term "farm to table." Farm to table is a term used to describe food that is sourced from local farms and thus is fresher and healthier. However, in this scenario, the farm is literal: the lemons are coming from the reaper's scythe, which he uses to harvest the souls of the dead. Thus, the lemons are as fresh as they can possibly be.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the phrase "farm to table" is usually used to describe food that is fresh and healthy because it hasn't been processed. However, the lemons the grim reaper is giving are from a deceased lemon tree, so they are the opposite of fresh. The joke is also a play on words because the scythe is a tool that the reaper uses to harvest lemons (and also people).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man turns to the woman to ask if the lemons the grim reaper is giving him are from a farm-to-table restaurant. This is a type of restaurant where the food is sourced from local farms, and so the joke is funny because it's a play on words: the lemons are coming from a farm, but it's the farm of death, not life.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully mocks the "farm to table" movement, which is a term used to describe food that is sourced from local farms and therefore is fresher and more sustainable. In this case, the "farm" is a field where the grim reaper is collecting lemons, and the "table" is where he is giving them to the couple. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: "farm to table" becomes "reaper to couple."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Grim Reaper, who is usually associated with death, is instead giving life in the form of lemons. The man's comment about the farm to table movement is sarcastic, because the farm is Death's farm, and the table is the afterlife.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the grim reaper, who is associated with death, is actually giving out lemons, which are a type of food. The joke is made funnier by the fact that the man says that the lemons are "farm to table," meaning that they are fresh and haven't been processed. This contrasts with the normal image of the grim reaper as someone who takes life away, rather than giving it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the grim reaper, who often symbolizes death, is instead giving life in the form of lemons. The joke plays on the common phrase "farm to table," which is used to describe food that is sourced locally and is therefore fresh. In this case, the grim reaper is the ultimate local farm, as he harvests souls. The woman's comment also references his scythe, a common attribute associated with the grim reaper.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "farm to table" is a term used to describe food that is sourced locally from farms, and thus is fresher and more natural. The Grim Reaper, who is Death personified, is offering the man a pan of lemons that he has just harvested --- i.e., the lemons are literally "farm to table." The contrast between the wholesome, natural image of "farm to table" food and the fact that the lemons are being offered by Death himself is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "farm to table." The grim reaper, who harvests people's souls, is literally bringing the lemons "to the table" from the "farm." This is a dark and morbid play on the phrase, which is typically used to talk about food that is fresh and local.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the grim reaper is cutting the lemons off of a tree himself, implying that the lemons are fresh, i.e., farm-to-table. The joke is clever because it playfully pokes at the pretentiousness of the farm-to-table movement while also acknowledging that, in this case, the food really is fresh because it was just cut from the tree.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "farm to table" is a type of food movement that stresses the importance of keeping the food system local, and supporting local farmers. In this case, the local farmer is the Grim Reaper, and the table is, well, a table in a field. The joke turns the common expression on its head, by pointing out the absurdities of where the food is coming from (i.e. the Grim Reaper) and how it's being delivered (i.e. by scythe).</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="45.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="47.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
