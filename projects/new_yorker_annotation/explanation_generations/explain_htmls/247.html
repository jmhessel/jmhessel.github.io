However, the Limo driver is from a much later time period, and is asking if the caveman has created any new paintings. The caveman probably hasn't, because he's been busy roasting meat, but the joke is still funny because of the juxtaposition of the two characters.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is using an outdated method of cooking meat, which is to roast it on a fire. This is in contrast to the limo, which is a very modern and luxurious mode of transportation. The joke is clever because it plays on the double meaning of "cave paintings": first, the literal meaning of paintings done by cavemen on cave walls, and second, the figurative meaning of something being old-fashioned or outdated.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the famous "Lascaux paintings", a series of cave paintings in southwestern France. The man in the limousine is asking the caveman if he's seen any new cave paintings, and the caveman, who is busy cooking, doesn't hear him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The limousine driver is asking the caveman if he's seen any new cave paintings, but the caveman is actually cooking in a cave, so thedriver's question is literal. This play on words is humorous because it's a very juxtaposition of two very different things.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the limousine is asking the caveman if he's made any new cave paintings, but the word "cave" can also be used as a verb meaning "to shelter or hide from something". In this case, the caveman is hiding from the limousine, which represents modernity and progress, in his cave.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. "Cave paintings" can refer to both the paintings that ancient people made on cave walls, and the modern phenomenon of "carvings" or "etchings" that people make on the side of luxury cars. The contrast between the ancient and the modern is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the cave is living in the stone age and thus would not have any new cave paintings. The irony is that the man in the limo, who is from the modern age, is asking him about new cave paintings, as if the caveman would have any way of knowing about them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The passenger in the limo is actually asking if the caveman has any new paintings, as in, art paintings. But, because they are in a cave, the caveman thinks they are asking about literal cave paintings, and he answers accordingly. The mismatch in time periods makes the joke even funnier because the caveman would have no idea what a limo is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The caveman is cooking meat, which is a common food, so the passenger in the limo is asking if he's seen any new cave paintings, which are also common in caves. The joke is clever because it's a pun on the word "meat" and the word "paintings."</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it asks about something that would be normal (cave paintings) in the context of a caveman, but the existence of a limousine, which didn't exist in caveman times, makes it a weird question. It's as if the caveman is asking about something that he knows nothing about.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of a caveman and a limousine. The caveman is from a time long before cars were invented, and the limousine is a very luxurious, modern car. The joke is also funny because it playfully pokes at the stereotype that cavemen were primitive and uneducated.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The man in the limo is asking if the caveman has made any new paintings, but the word "painting" can also refer to the act of cooking food. So the man in the limo is actually asking if the caveman has made any new meals, which is a ridiculous question.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the limo is making a joke about the caveman's primitive lifestyle. He's asking if the caveman has any new paintings, as if that's the only thing that the caveman does. This is a play on the stereotype that cavemen were uneducated and only concerned with hunting and gathering.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The caveman is cooking, so the man in the limousine asks if there are any "new" cave paintings, which could mean either paintings that the caveman has created recently, or paintings that the man in the limousine hasn't seen before. The latter meaning is more likely, since the man in the limousine is driving by and couldn't have seen any paintings that the caveman might have just made. The joke is clever because it could be interpreted either way.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the caveman is living in the Stone Age, while the limousine is a very modern invention. The contrast between the two is humorous, especially because the caveman is being asked about new cave paintings, something that is very old-fashioned, while he is using a very modern invention.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="246.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="248.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
