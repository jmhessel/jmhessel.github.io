The man on the top bunk is reading a book and talking to the man on the bottom, and he says "So you're the infamous Sudsy Malone." This is funny because Sudsy Malone is a character in a 1920's gangster movie, and the man on the bottom bunk looks like he is from that era. Thus, the joke is that the man on the bottom bunk is living in a different era than the man on the top bunk, and the man on the top bunk is making a reference to that.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man on the bottom bunk is taking a bubble bath in a bunk bed, which is Sudsy Malone's trademark. Sudsy Malone is a fictional character who is known for taking baths in unusual places, so the man in the bunk bed must be Sudsy Malone. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words; the man is both sudsy (because he's in a bubble bath) and he's a Malone (because that's his last name).</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the top bunk is talking to the man in the bottom bunk, who is taking a bath. The man in the top bunk is surprised to see that the man in the bottom bunk is Sudsy Malone, who is a famous criminal. The joke is clever because it plays on the fact that the two men are in a bunk bed, which can also be a synonym for jail.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="132.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="134.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
