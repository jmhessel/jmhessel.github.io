However, in this case, the joke is that the customer has such a large menu that the restaurant has run out of everything on it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has ordered something so large that the restaurant is out of it. This is a play on the common phrase "we're out of that," meaning that the restaurant is out of the food item that the customer wants. In this case, the customer has ordered so much food that the restaurant has literally run out of it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the disparity between the size of the menu and the amount of food the restaurant has available. The menu is so large that it's unrealistic that the restaurant would have all of the items listed on it; in fact, the waiter says that they're out of one of the items the man wants. This highlights the ridiculousness of the menu and the customer's expectations.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the fact that often, when someone is looking at a menu (particularly a large one), they will say that they don't know what they want, and the waiter will say something like, "That's okay, we have everything." In this case, the man has finally decided on something after looking at the huge menu, but it turns out that the restaurant is out of that item.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man has an impossibly large menu, which implies that the restaurant has an absurdly large number of items. The waiter's response of "we're out of that too" is a play on the common restaurant experience of ordering something off the menu, only to be told that the restaurant is out of that item. In this case, the waiter is saying that the restaurant is out of everything on the menu.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the running gag of a customer ordering something at a restaurant, only to be told that the kitchen is out of it. In this case, the customer has such a large and comprehensive menu that the waiter is out of everything the customer could possibly want to order.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the menu is so big that it's impossible for the restaurant to have everything on it in stock. The man is probably going to be disappointed no matter what he orders.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man's menu is so large that it's impossible for the restaurant to have everything on it. The waiter's response implies that the man is ordering something that the restaurant is out of.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the stereotype of a waiter being evasive or unhelpful when taking someone's order. In this case, the joke takes it to the extreme: the man has such a large menu that the waiter can't find anything that the restaurant has in stock.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter is exasperated with the man's huge order, and is sarcastic with him when he says that they're out of that too. The implication is that the restaurant is out of a lot of things, and the man's huge order is the reason why.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The waiter says that they are "out of that too," meaning that the restaurant is out of the dish that the man wanted to order. However, the phrase can also be interpreted to mean that the waiter is out of patience with the man, who has a huge menu and is taking a long time to order.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the waiter says they are "out of that" in reference to the dish the man wants to order --- but the man never specifies what dish he wants, because he's still looking at the huge menu. The waiter is just saying they are out of everything on the menu in an effort to speed up the ordering process, but the joke is that the man could order anything and the waiter would just say they are out of it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is holding a huge menu, but the waiter says they're out of the one thing he wants. The waiter's smile implies that this is a common occurrence at the restaurant, and the man's confusion implies that he doesn't understand why the menu is so big if they're constantly running out of food.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The man is holding a menu that is twice his size, so the waiter tells him that they're "out of that too" --- meaning, they don't have anything that the man can order, because the menu is too big for him.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the fact that the menu is so large, it's probably not possible for the restaurant to have all of the items on it in stock. The waiter is telling the man that they're out of the one item he wanted, but the joke is that they're probably out of a lot of the other items on the menu as well.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="132.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="134.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
