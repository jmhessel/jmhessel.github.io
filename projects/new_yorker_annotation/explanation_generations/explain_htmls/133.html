Batman then makes a joke about the businessman's ex-wife. The joke is clever because it is a play on words: the businessman's ex-wife got the house "in the divorce," but Batman is also saying that she got Batman "in the divorce." This is funny because it implies that the ex-wife got Batman as part of the settlement, which is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Batman is talking about his Batmobile, which the man assumes is Batman's ex-wife. This joke plays on the ambiguity of the word "it" --- the man thinks Batman is referring to his car as if it were a person, when in fact Batman is referring to the car as an inanimate object.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Batman is angry with the guy reading the newspaper, and he yells at him that he got the paper in the divorce. This is a play on the fact that often times in a divorce, one spouse will get the house and the other will get the paper (or some other asset). However, in this case, the man got the paper and Batman got nothing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the superhero is angrily confronting the man reading the paper, but the man's response is nonchalant, as if this is a daily occurrence. He's not phased by the fact that there's a superhero yelling at him, because he's probably used to it. This is a play on the superhero's secret identity: in most cases, the superhero is a normal person with a day job, and their superhero persona is something they do on the side. In this case, the man reading the paper is the superhero's ex-wife, and the superhero costume is something she got in the divorce.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the superhero costume is an unusual sight on the subway, and the man in the costume is yelling at the man reading the newspaper. The joke implies that the superhero is divorced and that his ex-wife got the costume in the divorce, which is why he's wearing it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the businessman, who is reading the paper, doesn't seem to realize that he's talking to Batman. Batman is a superhero, and thus is not someone who would normally be found in a subway. The joke implies that the businessman is so out of touch with reality that he doesn't even realize he's talking to a fictional character.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Batman is known for being wealthy, and the Batmobile is his preferred mode of transportation. In this scene, he is waiting for a train, which is much less glamorous. The fact that he is angrily shouting at the newspaper reader implies that he is having a bad day, made worse by the fact that he is forced to take the train. The newspaper reader is also to blame for his bad day, as he is reading about the divorce of Batman's ex-wife, which probably means that she got the Batmobile in the settlement.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Batman's superpower is his wealth, which he gained through his wife's divorce settlement. In the context of the subway, where people are usually poor or working class, the joke is funny because it highlights the contrast between Batman's wealth and the average person's lack thereof.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the superhero is Batman, who is well-known for being a billionaire playboy who inherited his wealth. In this context, the joke is that the man in the superhero costume is yelling at the man reading the newspaper because he inherited his wealth, while the man in the superhero costume (Batman) got his wealth through divorce.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the superhero costume is yelling at the other man for reading a newspaper with a headline about a woman getting a divorce. The man in the costume is yelling because he is Batman, and the woman getting a divorce is his ex-wife. The joke is clever because it uses the double meaning of the word "got": in this context, "got" can mean either "receive" or "understand." So the man in the costume is saying that the other man should have received the message that he should stop reading the paper, and also that he should understand why the man in the costume is so mad.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Batman is so angry with the man reading the newspaper that he is yelling at him. The man is unperturbed and calmly responds that he got the paper in the divorce, which diffuses Batman's anger. This is funny because Batman is usually in control of his emotions, but in this case, he is lashing out in anger and the man is able to calm him down with a simple explanation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the Batman is so angry with the guy reading the paper that he forgets that he is not supposed to reveal his secret identity. The joke is a play on the fact that people who are angry will say things they normally wouldn't, and in this case, Batman is so angry that he blurts out that he is Bruce Wayne.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the superhero is Batman, who is traditionally a wealthy person. Thus, the fact that he is yelling at the man reading the newspaper implies that he is angry because he thinks the man is not working hard enough. However, the joke takes this one step further: the fact that the superhero is yelling about the man's work ethic implies that the superhero is divorced, and the man reading the newspaper is his ex-wife. This is a reversal of traditional gender roles, which is what makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because Batman is so angry with the man reading the newspaper that he yells at him, even though he is not the one who ruined his relationship. The joke is a play on the fact that, often times, people who are angry at someone else will take it out on the wrong person. In this case, Batman is taking out his anger on the man reading the newspaper, even though that man had nothing to do with his divorce.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The guy reading the newspaper is on the "rapid transit," which is a play on the phrase "in the divorce." In other words, the guy reading the newspaper is moving on from his divorce (the divorce probably caused him to take the rapid transit), and Batman is still angry about it.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
