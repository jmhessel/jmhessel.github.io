The joke is a play on the common saying "it's a thin line between love and hate", but in this case, the line between the fern being a plant and the fern being the boss is very thin.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words: in the context of the meeting, the "he" refers to the boss, who is not actually present, but is represented by the fern. However, the "he" could also refer to the fern itself, which started out in the lobby (of the office building) and has now been promoted to the position of boss. The joke is clever because it can be interpreted in two ways.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity of the fern being the boss of the company. It's also funny because of the play on words: "to start out in the lobby" can mean two things, either that the person started working at the company in the lobby or that the person started out working in the company and has been promoted to the position of boss. In this case, it's the latter: the person started out as a fern in the lobby and has been promoted to the position of boss.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the incongruity between the fern, which is an inanimate object, and the meeting, which is a situation where people are supposed to be discussing business with a boss. The fact that the fern "started out in the lobby" suggests that it replacement of the boss is recent, and may not be a permanent change.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the fern started out in the lobby and moved its way up to the top. This is a metaphor for how the person who is the fern started at the bottom and worked their way up to the top.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the person is remarking on the fact that the fern, which is clearly not a human being, started out in the lobby of the building, and is now leading the meeting in place of the boss. This is absurd, and thus funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the fern was once a regular plant in the office building lobby, but through a series of promotions (or, in this case, lack thereof), the fern has become the boss of the company. This is funny because it's an absurd scenario, and also because it's a commentary on the slow rate of advancement in most corporations.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the fern has been promoted to the position of boss, and is now leading the meeting, which is absurd. The joke plays on the idea that someone starting out at a company in a low-level position could work their way up to a high-level position, but in this case, the fern started out in the lobby and was promoted all the way to the top.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the fern, which is an inanimate object, has been promoted to the position of company boss. This is absurd, because ferns cannot think or do anything that a boss would do. The fact that the fern was originally in the lobby and not in the meeting room highlights how absurd the promotion is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the fern, which is an inanimate object, is the boss of the company in this scene. This is absurd because, obviously, a plant cannot be a boss. The joke is also a play on words, because the fern was "started" (i.e., placed) in the lobby, and now it's "amazing" that it's the boss.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the fern is in the meeting in place of the boss, and the comment is a play on the common phrase "he started out in the mailroom." The mailroom is traditionally a low-level job in an organization, and the phrase is often used to describe someone who has risen through the ranks to a position of power. In this case, the fern has risen through the ranks to become the boss, which is absurd.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it uses the well-known idiom "to work one's way up from the bottom." In this case, the fern started out in the lobby of the company (presumably as decoration), and has worked its way up to the position of being the boss in a meeting. This is absurd, of course, because ferns cannot actually work.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the fern is in the position of power, and the people at the meeting are amazed that it started out in the lobby, i.e., it wasn't born into a position of power. This is a play on the common phrase "It's amazing to think he started out as a intern." which is usually said about people who have worked their way up the corporate ladder.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the fern is in the place of the boss, implying that the boss is a plant. This is a play on the common saying "he's in the wrong business" or "he's in over his head." The joke is also funny because it's true that ferns often start out in lobbies or other public areas in office buildings.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "lobby" can refer to the entrance hall of a building where people wait to be let in, or it can refer to a group of people who are working to support a cause. In this case, the "lobby" is the group of people at the meeting, and the fern is the entrance hall. The fern has taken the place of the boss, meaning that the people at the meeting have to represent the company. This is a reversal of the expected order, and it is funny because it is unexpected.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="-1.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="1.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
