The elephant in the room is a metaphor for a problem or issue that is being ignored, and the speaker is telling the other person that they should just wear a button, which is a small item, in contrast to the large elephant. The joke is clever because it is both a play on words and a play on the metaphor.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. In this context, the word "button" can mean two things: 1) a physical button that people can wear on their clothes and 2) an colloquialism meaning "topic that isAvoiding an unpleasant or emotionally charged topic of conversation." In the context of the elephant in the room, the word "button" takes on the second meaning, since the elephant's presence is an unpleasant topic that the man and woman are trying to avoid.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the phrase "the elephant in the room." In this case, the speaker is asking why the person with the elephant in the room can't just deal with their problem the way most people do, by ignoring it. The irony is that the person with the elephant is actually ignoring the problem, but the speaker is still pointing it out.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "elephant in the room" is often used to describe an issue that everyone is avoiding because it makes them uncomfortable. In this case, the joke is that the person is actually wearing a button that says "elephant" on it, which is a more direct but still subtle way of drawing attention to the fact that there is an elephant in the room.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is saying that the woman, who has an elephant in her living room, should try to act like normal people. The comparison is funny because, while most people don't have elephants in their living room, it's still more normal to have an elephant in the living room than it is to wear a button.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The phrase "elephant in the room" is often used to describe an obvious problem or issue that people are choosing to ignore. In this situation, the elephant is actually a large animal in the room, and the joke is that the people are choosing to ignore the elephant.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the idiom "to wear your heart on your sleeve," which means to be emotionally honest. In this situation, the person is suggesting that, instead of having an elephant in the room (a metaphor for a big issue that everyone is ignoring), the person should just wear a button that says "I have an issue." This would be a more direct and less ignored way of handling the problem.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the speaker is addressing the elephant in the room directly --- usually, people avoid talking about the elephant, hence the idiom. The speaker is asking the elephant why it can't just be like other animals, and wear a button (i.e., be domesticated). The joke is poking fun at the fact that the speaker is avoiding the elephant by talking about it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the elephant is not wearing clothes, and the man is asking why the elephant can't just put on a button like most people. The joke is clever because it uses the idiom "the elephant in the room," which means a big problem that is being ignored, to ask why the elephant isn't wearing clothes, which is a big problem that is being ignored.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman is asking the man why he can't just be like everyone else, and wear a button. The man's response implies that the woman is overreacting to the fact that there's an elephant in the room, when in reality, it's not a big deal. The joke is a play on the phrase "elephant in the room," which is used to describe a big issue that everyone is aware of but no one wants to talk about.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is asking the woman why she can't just be like most people, and ignore the elephant in the room. However, the fact that there's an elephant in the room is exactly what prevents her from doing so, and the joke is clever in that it points out the absurdity of his request.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man is asking the woman to do something that is impossible: to wear a button, like most people. The woman, in contrast, is asking the man to do something that is very possible: to move the elephant out of the room. The absurdity of the man's request makes the joke funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "elephant in the room" is often used to describe an issue that is being ignored by the people involved, even though it is obvious to everyone else. In this case, the joke is that the person is actually wearing a button that says "elephant in the room" on it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the elephant in the room is a metaphor for an issue that is being ignored. The fact that there is an actual elephant in the room makes the joke even funnier, because it's a literal manifestation of the issue. The button is a reference to the common coping mechanism of "elephant in the room" avoidance, where people pretend the issue doesn't exist.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The person is asking why the other person, who has an elephant in the room, can't just cover up the elephant like most people. The word "button" can mean a physical button that covers up a hole in clothing, or it can mean a small, unimportant thing. In this case, the person is saying that the elephant is a small, unimportant thing that can be ignored, just like a button.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="146.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="148.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
