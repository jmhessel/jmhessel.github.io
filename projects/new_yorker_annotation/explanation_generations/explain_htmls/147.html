Nine lives. You do the math.</p><hr><ul><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the common saying "a cat has nine lives." In this case, the mouse has a gun and is threatening to kill the cat, suggesting that the cat's life may be in danger. However, the fact that the mouse has a gun that is way too large for him suggests that he may not be able to actually kill the cat, making the whole situation humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because mice are known for having a lot of lives, so the fact that the mouse has a gun means that it's prepared to kill the cat six times over. The joke also plays on the fact that cats are known for being good at math.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on the saying "the cat's got your tongue." In this case, the mouse has the cat's tongue, or rather, the cat is at the mercy of the mouse.
