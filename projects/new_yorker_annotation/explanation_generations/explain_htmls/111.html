The woman is implying that the man should know where they are going, even though they are in a child's bed. The joke is also funny because it is a play on words: the woman is literally asking the man for directions, but she is also asking him to have sex with her.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man and woman are in a racecar bed, which is meant for children. This implies that they are acting childish, and the joke is that the woman is scolding the man for not asking for directions, which is something that children are often chided for. The joke is clever because it's a play on words: asking for directions is a sensible thing to do, but in this case, it would "kill" the mood.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a pun on the phrase "would it kill you?" which is often used to politely ask someone to do something that they are clearly capable of doing. In this case, the woman is asking her partner to ask for directions, because they are clearly lost, as evidenced by the fact that they are in a child's racecar bed. The joke is also funny because it's a play on words: the woman is literally asking if it would kill the man to ask for directions, and the answer is probably "no," but it might kill the mood.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="110.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="112.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
