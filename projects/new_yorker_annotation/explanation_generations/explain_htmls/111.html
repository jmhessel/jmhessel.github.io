In this case, instead of a jury, it is a group of clones, which is a more appropriate analogy given the situation. The fact that it is the Senate Committee on Women's Health is also a bit ironic, as this would be a group of people who would be more interested in ensuring women's health, rather than furthering it.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the men are clones, and thus they are all identical, including their gender. The woman on the phone is shocked to see so many men exiting the room because, presumably, she was expecting to see a group of women. However, she is quickly informed that the group is actually the Senate Committee on Women's Health, which is a real committee in the United States Senate.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase "hold on" can mean to wait, or to stop, and in this case, the woman on the phone is telling the person on the other line to stop talking because the Senate Committee on Women's Health is coming out. The joke is clever because the word "hold" can also be used as a verb meaning to contain, as in "to hold a meeting." In this case, the joke is that the all-male clones are contained in the room, and are only coming out now.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The word "senate" can refer to a group of people who make decisions, such as a committee, or it can refer to a group of clones. In this case, the clones are walking out of a room, and the woman on the phone is shocked to see them. The joke is clever because it uses the two meanings of the word "senate" to make a pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because of the juxtaposition of the serious topic of a Senate committee meeting with the absurd image of a crowd of clones. The joke works because, in reality, Congress is often ineffective and bogged down by infighting and partisan politics, so the image of a bunch of clones emerging from a meeting implies that the body is so inefficient that it's just a bunch of duplicates of the same person.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully pokes at the fact that the United States Senate, the upper chamber of Congress, has been historically male-dominated. The joke imagines a world in which the few women in the Senate are so outnumbered that they are easily replaced by clones, and thus their health committee would be easily dismissed.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it pokes fun at the United States Congress, which is often criticized for being inefficient and out-of-touch. In this case, the Senate Committee on Women's Health is implied to be entirely composed of men, which is absurd given that women's health is an important and pressing issue. The fact that they are clones just adds to the ridiculousness of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it takes a group of identical men and gives them a completely different context: instead of being a group of clones, they are now a group of senators who have just left a committee hearing on women's health. This is humorous because it parody how U.S. senators are (usually) men, and how they are often perceived as being out-of-touch with issues that directly affect women.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it points out the inherent sexism of having an all-male Senate Committee on Women's Health. It's a play on words because the phrase "getting out" can mean either leaving a room or ejaculating, and given that there are a dozen men, it's implied that they are all masturbating. The woman's shocked expression emphasizes the absurdity of the situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the concept of a "Senate Committee on Women's Health" is absurd. There is no such thing in the United States Senate. However, the existence of clones is also absurd, which makes the joke even funnier.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman's reaction to the clones implies that they are a common sight, when in reality, they are not. The joke pokes fun at the imaginary bureaucracy of the Senate Committee on Women's Health: if there were such a thing, it would be a very strange sight to see a room full of clones of the same man.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "Senate Committee on Women's Health" is a real thing, but in this context, it's a group of all-male clones, which is a humorous contrast. The joke is also clever because it's a play on the phrase "hold on, the cavalry is coming," which would be a completely different situation and not at all helpful in the context of a room full of clones.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The group of men are clones, so they are all exactly the same. However, the woman on the phone is talking to the Senate committee on women's health, which is a group of people who are not the same. The joke is clever because it makes a reference to the fact that the clones are all men, and the women's health committee is, well, a committee for women's health.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in the United States Senate, the Senate Committee on Women's Health is a real committee, but its existence is often denied by those who oppose government funding for women's health initiatives. In this situation, the clones represent the senators who deny the committee's existence, and the woman on the phone is contacting the committee to try and get help.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully pokes at the United States Senate's ineffectiveness: the Senate has a real Committee on Women's Health, but given the status of women's health care in America, it's laughable to imagine that they would be able to get anything done, even if they were to clone themselves.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="110.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="112.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
