The fire button in the elevator is usually used in case of an emergency, but in this case, it seems to have caused the emergency. The woman waiting to get on the elevator is surprised and horrified at the sight, and makes a pun on the word "fire" to lighten the mood.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The "fire" button in an elevator is usually a button that you can press in case of an emergency, which would presumably summon the fire department. But in this case, pushing the button has caused the people in the elevator to catch on fire, which is the opposite of what it's supposed to do.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, in most office buildings, the fire button is for summoning the fire department in case of an emergency. However, in this office building, it looks like pushing the fire button will send the elevator down to hell, which is probably not what the woman wanted.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The button in the elevator that says "FIRE" is usually there to notify people in case of an emergency, but in this case, it seems like pushing the button is what caused the people in the elevator to catch on fire, hence the joke.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a reference to the Rick White song "Going Down." In that song, the singer talks about being in an elevator that's on fire, and how he pushes the "FIRE" button to try to get help. In this case, the woman is making a joke about how she now knows what the "FIRE" button actually does.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully subverts the viewer's expectations: in most cases, the "FIRE" button in an elevator is used as an emergency measure to signal the fire department. However, in this case, pushing the button results in the people inside the elevator being set on fire. This discrepancy is humorous.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it playfully suggests that the woman, who is seemingly unphased by the fire, must have caused it by hitting the "FIRE" button in the elevator. The joke is clever because it uses the double-meaning of the word "fire" --- in this context, the button usually refers to an emergency situation in which the occupants need to be evacuated, but the button caused a different type of fire.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman sees the people in the elevator on fire, and makes a quip about how pushing the "FIRE" button in an elevator actually causes the people in the elevator to catch on fire. This is unexpected and surreal, making it amusing.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman waiting to get on the elevator sees that the people inside are on fire, and assumes that they pushed the 'FIRE' button, not knowing that it actually summons the fire department. However, the joke could also be interpreted to mean that the woman is making a pun, since the 'FIRE' button is also used to describe something that is really good, as in "that new restaurant is on fire!"</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the woman waiting to get on the elevator makes a joke about the people in the elevator being on fire. The joke is clever because it play on the literal meaning of the fire button --- instead of being a button that signals for help because there's a fire, it's a button that actually causes a fire.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman waiting to get on the elevator sees that the people in the elevator are on fire, and she quips that this must be what the "FIRE" button does. Of course, the actual fire button is there to stop the elevator in case of an emergency, but in this case, it seems to have caused the fire.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the man in the elevator is asking the woman a question about the fire button in the elevator, and she nonchalantly replies that it sets the elevator passengers on fire. The joke is clever because it plays with the idea of a " emergency button" --- in this case, the fire button is actually an emergency button, but not in the way that people usually think.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman waiting for the elevator sees that the people in the elevator are on fire, and she makes a joke that the button labeled "FIRE" must set the elevator on fire. But of course, the button doesn't actually do that; it's just a button that signals for the fire department in case of an emergency. The woman's joke is clever because it's unexpected and turns the situation into a pun.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The woman in the elevator lobby sees that the people in the elevator are on fire, and presumably presumes that they hit the "FIRE" button, which would make sense in that it would summon the fire department. However, the joke is that the fire was not started by hitting the "FIRE" button, but rather that the "FIRE" button is what caused the people to be on fire in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The woman is waiting to get on the elevator, but the people in the elevator are on fire. The joke is that the fire button in the elevator actually makes the elevator go down to Hell.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="110.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="112.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
