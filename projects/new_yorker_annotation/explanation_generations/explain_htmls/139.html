The aliens "abducted" (took) the dog, but they were probably expecting to abduct (kidnap) a human instead. The dog being on the spaceship and wagging its tail makes it clear that it is friendly, which is not what they were expecting or looking for.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because "abduct" can mean either to take something or someone against their will (as in, aliens abducting humans for experimentation), or to simply take something or someone away (as in, the police abducting a criminal). In this case, the aliens thought they were abducting the dog for experimentation, but instead they just took the Trump family pet.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the aliens have mistaken the dog for President Trump, when they were actually instructed to abduct him. This is humorous because it paints Trump as an innocuous, suburban dog, rather than the powerful world leader he is.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the aliens have accidentally abducted a common dog instead of President Trump, who is a much more high-profile target. The aliens are probably disappointed with their catch, and the dog is probably confused about why it was abducted in the first place.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the aliens have mistakenly abducted a regular dog instead of the President of the United States, who has the same surname ("Trump"). This mistake is humorous because it is a very big misunderstanding that could have major consequences.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the aliens have mistaken the dog for the president when in reality, they probably meant to abducted the president. The dog being in space and the aliens' mistake are both unexpected and funny.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. The aliens abducted the dog instead of the President, which was probably not their intention. The dog wagging its tail is also humorous because it implies that even though the aliens are probably not its owner, the dog is still happy to see them.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "abduct" can mean to take something by force, or to take something/someone to a different place. In this case, the aliens have taken the dog against its will to their spaceship. However, they were actually supposed to abduct the human President Trump. The joke is funnier if you imagine that the dog is actually the President in disguise.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because the aliens have mistakenly abducted a random dog instead of President Trump, who they presumably intended to abduct. The aliens have blank expressions on their faces, lending themselves to being easily confused; in addition, the suburban dog on the platform is not an obvious target for abduction by aliens, compared to a high-profile figure like the President of the United States.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The aliens were trying to "abduct" the dog, meaning to kidnap it, but they mistakenly took the American president instead. This is funny because it's a reversal of the common trope of aliens abducting humans.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "abduct" can mean to kidnap or to take something away, and in this context, the aliens have taken the dog away. However, the aliens probably didn't mean to take the dog away from its owner (to kidnap it), but rather to take it back to their own planet (to abduct it). The dog most likely belongs to Trump, given that he is a well-known dog-lover, and so the aliens have accidentally kidnapped the President's dog.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The aliens "abducted" the dog, but they thought they were abducting President Trump. The fact that the dog is wagging its tail makes it seem like it's happy to be there, which is a contrast to how President Trump would probably react if he were in the same situation.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because, instead of abducting a human, the aliens have mistakenly abducted a dog. The dog, who looks very suburban and normal, is a stand-in for an everyman, someone who is not extraordinary or noteworthy. This mistake is funny because it is a contrast to the aliens' goal of abducting an important human like President Trump.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "abduct" can mean to kidnapping someone against their will, but it can also mean to simply take something or someone away. In this case, the aliens thought they were kidnapping the President of the United States (an action which would likely be met with opposition), but instead, they just took a random dog.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it's a play on words. The word "abduct" can mean to take something by force, or it can simply mean to take something away. In this situation, the aliens have confused the meaning of the word and have taken a dog instead of the President of the United States. The joke is clever because it's a play on words that can be easily missed if you're not paying attention.</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="138.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="140.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
