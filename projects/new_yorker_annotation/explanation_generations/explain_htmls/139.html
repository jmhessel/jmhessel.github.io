The speaker is saying that they can remember when the chicken was just an intern, which implies that the chicken has since been promoted to a larger position within the company. However, the joke is also pointing out that the chicken is actually very large, which is not something that typically happens to intern-level employees.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it is a play on words. A "fuzzy yellow intern" could refer to either a chicken that is still young and has yet to develop feathers, or a human intern who is new to the job and still learning. In this case, it is both: the chicken was once an intern, and is now a full-fledged member of the office.</p></li><li><p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">The joke is funny because it implies that the chicken used to be a human intern, and has since been turned into a chicken. This is silly because it's impossible to turn a human into a chicken. The joke is also funny because it's a play on the phrase "I can remember when she was just a little girl," which is often used to talk about how someone has grown up (in this case, the chicken has grown up into a giant chicken).</p></li><p style="text-align:center;"><form action="138.html"><input type="submit" value="Previous" /></form> <form action="140.html"><input type="submit" value="Next"/></form></p>
