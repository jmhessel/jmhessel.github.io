<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p> When large social-media platforms allow users to easily form
and self-organize into interest groups, highly related communities
can arise. For example, the Reddit site hosts not just a
group called food, but also HealthyFood, foodhacks, foodporn,
and cooking, among others. Are these highly related
communities created for similar classes of reasons (e.g., "true"
to distinguish one as a better community and "advice" to focus
on helping fellow members)? How do users allocate attention
between such close alternatives when they are available
or emerge over time? Are there different types of relations
between close alternatives such as sharing many users
vs. a new community drawing away members of an older
one vs. a splinter group failing to cohere into a viable separate
community? We investigate the interactions between
highly related communities using data from reddit.com
consisting of 975M posts and comments spanning an 8-year
period. We identify a set of typical affixes that users adopt
to create highly related communities and build a taxonomy
of affixes. One interesting finding regarding users' behavior
is: after a newer community is created, for several types of
highly-related community pairs, users that engage in a newer
community tend to be more active in their original community
than users that do not explore, even when controlling for
previous level of engagement. </p>
